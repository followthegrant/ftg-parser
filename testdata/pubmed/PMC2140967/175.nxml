By means of a differential volumeter the increased oxygen consumption and the increased carbon dioxide output of frog nerve during and after stimulation have been observed. 2. Measurements of the R.Q. of nerve by this method are complicated by the retention of carbon dioxide. Attempts were made to avoid this (<italic>a</italic>) by studying the nerves at high CO<sub>2</sub> tensions to make the retention small and (<italic>b</italic>) by calculating the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> retained from the carbon dioxide dissociation curve of nerve and applying this value as a correction. 3. The results of both those methods when averaged together give an R.Q. of the excess metabolism of 1.19 and an R.Q. of the resting nerve of 0.97. 4. Observations on the time course of the gas exchange during stimulation indicate a delay in the appearance of the extra carbon dioxide output relative to the oxygen intake. 5. Very similar time curves can be calculated from the diffusion coefficients and the solubilities of the oxygen and the carbon dioxide. </p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
