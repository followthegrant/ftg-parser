The rats in ischemic postconditioning group were subjected to three cycles of 30-s/30-s reperfusion/clamping after 15min of ischemia. Neuronal death in the CA1 region was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, and number of live neurons was assessed by cell counting under a light microscope. Succinyl-LLVY-AMC was used as substrate to assay proteasome activity in vitro. Protein carbonyl content was spectrophotometrically measured to analyze protein oxidization. Immunochemistry and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to observe the distribution of ubiquitin in the CA1 neurons. Western blotting was used to analyze the quantitative alterations of protein aggregates, proteasome, hsp70 and hsp40 in cellular fractions under different ischemic conditions.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Histological examination showed that the percentage of live neurons in the CA1 region was elevated from 5.21%&#x000b1;1.21% to 55.32%&#x000b1;5.34% after administration of ischemic postconditioning (<italic>P</italic>=0.0087). Western blotting analysis showed that the protein aggregates in the ischemia group was 32.12&#x000b1;4.87, 41.86&#x000b1;4.71 and 34.51&#x000b1;5.18 times higher than that in the sham group at reperfusion 12h, 24h and 48h, respectively. However, protein aggregates were alleviated significantly by ischemic postconditioning to 2.84&#x000b1;0.97, 13.72&#x000b1;2.13 and 14.37&#x000b1;2.42 times at each indicated time point (<italic>P</italic>=0.000032, 0.0000051 and 0.0000082). Laser scanning confocal images showed ubiquitin labeled protein aggregates could not be discerned in the ischemic postconditioning group.

Introduction</title><p>Transient global cerebral ischemia is a clinical outcome related to cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and other situations that deprives the oxygen and glucose in brain during a short period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>. In the rat model simulating human transient global cerebral ischemia, it was found that neurons in the hippocampus CA1 region were severely damaged during the period of reperfusion, which leaded to the impairment of rats' memory or spatial learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. Similarly, in human being, a clinical study showed that the lesion in CA1 region could result in place learning deficit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. These indicate that protection of neuronal injury or death in the CA1 region would improve the prognosis of the patients with transient ischemia and reperfusion.</p><p>Protein aggregation is a biological phenomenon in which abnormal proteins accumulate and clump together either intra- or extracellularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>. Until Hu et al found that abnormal proteins accumulated in the neurons destined to die after transient cerebral ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, protein aggregation had been thought to play a pivotal role in neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>. Currently, as well as other mechanisms such as calcium overload and oxidative stress, protein aggregation is also regarded as one of the important pathological features of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>. Although these aggregated proteins cannot function normally, they could stick to the intracellular membrane structures and result in cell losing its normal function and dying in the end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>. Therefore, aggregated proteins should be rescued or eliminated in order to keep neurons alive and function normally.</p><p>Recently, it had been reported that ischemic postconditioning has protective effects on neuronal injury or death caused by focal or global ischemia and reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. Ischemic postconditioning is defined as a series of rapid intermittent interruptions of blood flow in the early phase of reperfusion that mechanically alters the hydrodynamics of reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. It could be performed before re-establishment of blood supply to brain, which makes it become a feasible method used potentially in clinical practice. Despite studies showed that ischemic postconditioning could rescue neuronal injury or death via inhibiting inflammation, suppressing oxidative stress or preventing apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, the effects of ischemic postconditioning on protein aggregation are still unclear. Studying the alteration of protein aggregation would contribute further to clarify the protective mechanism of ischemic postconditioning. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated the role of ischemic postconditioning in protein aggregation by using rat model of transient global ischemia.</p></sec><sec id="Section2"><title>2.

All animal procedures were approved by the ethical committee for animal experiments, Jilin University, Changchun, China.</p></sec><sec id="Section2.3"><title>2.3 Ischemia model</title><p>Brain ischemia was produced by using the 2-vessel occlusion (2VO) model. Male Wistar rats were fasted overnight and freely accessed to water. Anesthesia was induced with 5% halothane and maintained with 2% halothane in oxygen/nitrous oxide (30%/70%) gas mixture. Catheters were inserted into the femoral artery and tail artery to allow blood sampling, arterial blood pressure recording and drug infusion. Both of the common carotid arteries were encircled by loose ligatures. At 10 min prior to ischemia induction and 10 min post-ischemia, blood gases were measured and adjusted to <italic>P</italic>aO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e; 90 mmHg, <italic>P</italic>aCO<sub>2</sub> 35-45 mmHg, and pH 7.35-7.45 by regulating the tidal volume of the respirator. Bipolar electroencephalograph was recorded before, during and after ischemia until rat recovery from anesthesia. Brain ischemia was induced by withdrawing blood via the femoral artery catheter to produce a mean artery blood pressure of 50 mmHg, followed by clamping both carotid arteries for 15 min. Mean artery blood pressure was maintained at 50 mmHg during the ischemic period by withdrawing or infusing blood through the femoral catheter. At the end of the ischemia, the clamps were removed and the withdrawn blood was re-infused. Halothane was discontinued and all wounds were sutured. In all experiments, brain temperature was maintained at 37<sup> o</sup>C before, during and after ischemia (15 min of reperfusion).</p></sec><sec id="Section2.4"><title>2.4 Postconditioning protocol</title><p>At the start of the study, 150 rats were assigned randomly into an ischaemia group and an ischemic postconditioning group according to a computer generated randomization schedule. On the basis of reperfusion time, each group was divided into following subgroups, including sham-operated group (as control), reperfusion 12h group, reperfusion 24h group, reperfusion 48h group and reperfusion 72h group. Each group included four rats at least. Except the rats in the sham-operated group did not subject to clamp both carotid arteries, other rats were subjected to cerebral ischaemia as described above. Additionally, the rats in ischemic postconditioning group were subjected to three cycles of 30-s/30-s reperfusion/clamping after 15min of ischaemia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Section2.5"><title>2.5 Brain tissue fixation</title><p>After rat was anesthetized, the thorax was opened and the heart was disclosed. Herpin (0.1 mL, 300 IU/kg) was injected into the left ventricle before the catheter was inserted into the main artery via left atrium. Then, PBS was perfused into the vascular system at 4<sup> o</sup>C for 3 min, and PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde was perfused at 4<sup> o</sup>C for another 3 min. Subsequently, the brain tissue was taken out and put into PBS fixation solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde at 4<sup> o</sup>C. Twelve hours later, the 13-&#x000b5;m and 50-&#x000b5;m coronal brain slices were cut by vibrotome and the brain slices in similarity were selected for hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry labeling, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Section2.6"><title>2.6 Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and histological examination</title><p>The 13-&#x000b5;m brain slices were mounted on slides and kept in dark room until dried.

Then, they were put into hematoxylin solution for 15 s, washed up by distilled water, immersed in Scott solution for 10 s, and washed again by distilled water. After being immersed in Eosin solution 10 s, these brain slices were redehydrated in gradient ethanol solution again, treated with dimethylbenzene and covered with coverslips. Under 40&#x000d7; objective lens of light microscope, the living neurons were counted from the representative sections of hippocampus CA1 region by an observer blinded to the treatment.

After cooling down, the slices were washed with the TBS solution containing 0.2% TX-100 for 10 min and blocked in the TBS solution containing 3% BSA and 0.2% TX-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Then, they were incubated with 1:1000 monocolonal anti-ubiquitin antibody at 4 <sup>o</sup>C overnight. After washed up with TBS solution containing 0.1%TX-100 for three times (10 min each) at room temperature, the antibody-labeled brain slices were incubated with 1% BSA containing fluorescence labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:200) and propidium iodide (1:1 000) for 1 h at room temperature. Again, the brain slices were washed with TBS solution containing 0.1% TX-100 for three times (10 min), and then they were mounted on slides and dried in dark room.

After weighting, the tissues were homogenized with Dounce homogenizer in 10 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer (1.5 mmol/L Tris base-HCl pH 7.6, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.25 mol/L sucrose, 1 mmol/L MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 &#x000b5;g/mL pepstatin A, 10 &#x000b5;g/mL leupeptin, 2.5 &#x000b5;g/mL aproptonin, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF, 2.5 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.1 mol/L Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mmol/L NaF, and 2 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate).

Generally, compared with the normal neurons, the dead or dying neurons presented polygonal condensed nucleus and pink cytosl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, only 9.12&#x000b1;1.87 neurons per mm in CA1 region were alive after 72h reperfusion in the ischemia group, whereas 96.85&#x000b1;9.71 neurons per mm alive in the ischemic post-conditioning group (<italic>P </italic>=0.0082 <italic>vs</italic> Sham group). Therefore, after 3 cycles of 30-second/30-second reperfusion/reclampping, many neurons in the CA1 region were rescued from subsequent lethal ischemia. This result demonstrated three cycles of 30 seconds reperfusion is an effective ischemic post conditioning procedure.</p></sec><sec id="Section3.2"><title>3.2 Ischemic postconditioning attenuated protein aggregation</title><p>After cellular fractions were isolated, the TX-100 insoluble fraction was regarded as protein aggregates, and anti-ubiquitin antibody could be used to detect the formation of protein aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>. As figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> showed, at reperfusion 12h, 24h and 48h, the protein aggregates was 32.12&#x000b1;4.87, 41.86&#x000b1;4.71 and 34.51&#x000b1;5.18 times higher than that in the sham group. However, after administration of ischemic postconditioning, they reduced to 2.84&#x000b1;0.97, 13.72&#x000b1;2.13 and 14.37&#x000b1;2.42 times at each indicated time point (<italic>P</italic>=0.000032, 0.0000051 and 0.0000082 <italic>vs</italic> contemporary ischemia group). Because the quantity of protein aggregates culminated at reperfusion 24h (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and part of CA1 neurons died at reperfusion 48h (data not shown), we chose to observe the distribution of protein aggregates at reperfusion 24h. Laser scanning confocal images of the ischemia group showed that proteins aggregates labeled by ubiquitin were located in cytosol and around nucleus, but they could not be discerned in the ischemic postconditioning group (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These data suggested that the protein aggregation was attenuated by ischemic postconditioning performed before reperfusion.</p></sec><sec id="Section3.3"><title>3.3 Ischemic postconditioning reduced the products of protein oxidation</title><p>Part of the components of protein aggregates are from oxidized proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, thus we examined in this study the effect of ischemic postconditioning on protein oxidation by measuring carbonyl derivatives of protein proline, lysine, arginine and threonine residues, a kind of common products of protein oxidation. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, in comparison with that of the sham group, the levels of carbonyl derivatives increased to 169.72%&#x000b1;23.16%, 214.33%&#x000b1;39.41% and 210.56%&#x000b1;32.11% at reperfusion 12h, 24h and 48h, respectively.

We found that the quantity of 20S (the core unit of proteasome) and 19S (catalytic unit of proteasome) reduced at reperfusion 12h and continued to 48h in the ischemia group. By contrast, ischemic postconditioning attenuated the quantitative reduction of 20S and 19S (<italic>P</italic>=0.00062 and 0.00059 for 20S, and <italic>P</italic>=0.0092 and 0.0078 for 19S). This indicated that ischemic postconditioning maintained the quantity of proteasome in the CA1 neurons that suffered subsequently lethal ischemia, which might partly underlie why ischemic postconditioning could depress the reduction of proteasome activity.</p></sec><sec id="Section3.5"><title>3.5 ischemic postconditioning maintained the quantity of hsp40 and up-regulated the expression of hsp70</title><p>Chaperones are a functionally related group of proteins that assist protein folding under physiological and stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>.

Discussion</title><p>The protective effects of ischemic postconditioning on ischemic injury have been found in various organs, such as brain, liver and intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>. Its underlying mechanism has also been investigated widely and was found to be associated with multiple factors involved in the pathological course of delayed neuronal death caused by ischemia and reperfusion, such as suppression of oxidative stress, activation of signal pathway, regulation of enzyme activity and inhibition of endoplasmic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>. Despite previous studies had shown that protein aggregation is an important factor affecting neuronal injury and death caused by ischemia and reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, the effects of ischemic postconditioning on protein aggregation has not yet been clear. In this study, by using rat model of transient global ischemia, we demonstrated that the benefit of ischemic postconditioning is associated with attenuating protein aggregation.</p><p>Overproduction of abnormal proteins that exceeds the capacity of protein degradation is an important factor leading to the formation of cytotoxic protein aggregates. It is currently thought that unfolded proteins, misfolded proteins and oxidized proteins constitute the majority of abnormal proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. How abnormal proteins are generated under ischemia and reperfusion condition is still uncertain, but it was thought previously that ischemic stress made cellular proteins unfold and lose their three dimensional conformation, so that the sticky hydrophobic residues buried within the proteins are exposed and tend to stick to one another, precipitate, and accumulate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>.</p><p>Similar to our study, protein oxidation under the condition of transient ischemia and reperfusion was previously studied by using rat model. The results showed that the carbonyl derivatives, a kind of products of protein oxidation, steadily increased in re-flow period and culminated at 48 h of reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>. Moreover, it was found that oxidized proteins are prone to accumulating together and forming cytotoxic protein aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>. We did not investigate in this study the mechanism that underlies the attenuation of protein oxidation after application of ischemic postconditioning, but our previous study showed that ischemic postconditioning limited the increment of oxidized protein through inhibiting oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>. Recently, it was found that protein aggregates did not form at the end of ischemia, but formed during the period of reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, which made us speculate that ischemic postconditioning could disturb the formation course of protein aggregates. In this study, we proved that ischemic postconditioning suppressed protein aggregation and protein oxidation, indicating that ischemic postconditioning rescued neuronal death in the CA1 region via limiting the formation of protein aggregation.</p><p>Decreased capacity of intracellular protein degradation system is another factor influencing protein aggregation. There are two major protein degradation systems within cells, the proteasome pathway and the autophagy pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>. Although the function of autophagy in the neuronal death caused by ischemia and reperfusion is still unclear, the ubiquitin immunoreactivity of protein aggregates suggested that proteasome is a crucial pathway for degrading these abnormal proteins prior to their aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>. Moreover, it was found that the decline of proteasome activity is not able to remove oxidized proteins efficiently from old cells and proteasomal inhibition caused the formation of protein aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>. Because previous studies showed that proteasome activity could be damaged by transient ischemia and reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, we compared the proteasome activity in the CA1 neurons treated with or without ischemic postconditioning. Our results showed that, ischemic postconditioning kept proteasome activity at higher level via maintaining its quantity, which contributed to degrade more unfolded, misfolded and oxidized proteins. Thus, modulation of proteasome activity by ischemic postconditioning is another reason leading to the reduction of protein aggregation.</p><p>However, it was also reported that a proteasome inhibitor given to rats at the end of 2 h focal ischaemia would decrease the size of cerebral infarct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>. Current studies suggest that excessive inhibition of proteasome activity might activate the anti-inflammatory effect linked to the modulation of nuclear factor activity, attenuate the expression of cytokine and cellular adhesion molecules, and reduce the infiltration of neutrophil and macrophage into the injured rat brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>. Additionally, an in vitro study showed that inhibition of proteasome activity would result in activation of autophagy pathway, which could eliminate oxidized proteins and might explain why a proteasome inhibitor provides protection for cerebral injury induced by focal ischaemia and reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>. By contrast, the study by Liu et al showed that the activity of autophagy might be suppressed under the condition of ischemia and reperfusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>, which indicated that suppression of autophagy might be another mechanism underlying the formation of protein aggregates following ischemia and reperfusion. Especially, recent study demonstrated that autophagy played an important role in the cardio-protection induced by ischemic preconditioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, suggesting maintaining autophagy is a potential strategy to prevent protein aggregation. Thus, it should be investigated in future whether the reduction in protein aggregates caused by ischemic postconditioning is via autophagy.</p><p>The cellular machinery for maintaining proteostasis includes molecular chaperones as well, which facilitate protein folding and reduce proteotoxicity. In addition to their role in protein folding, chaperones help assemble and disassemble protein complexes, help present substrates for degradation, and suppress protein aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>. Among the chaperones, hsp70 is a stress-induced protein located in cytoplasm and has the ability to recognize and bind nascent, partially folded and unfolded proteins, and promote their refolding or degradation, while hsp40 could enhance this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>. Thus, in combination with hsp40, hsp70 could prevent protein aggregation and facilitate correct protein folding. In this study, our results suggested that suppression of protein aggregation by ischemic postconditioning might be related to elevate the expression of inducible chaperone hsp70 and maintained the quantity of hsp40.</p></sec><sec id="Section5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Our study showed that ischemic postconditioning could reduce significantly neuronal death in the CA1 region caused by transient ischemia/reperfusion, which is closely associated with suppressing the formation of protein aggregation. The attenuation of protein aggregation is associated with decreasing the production of protein oxidization, maintaining the activity and quantity of proteasome, limiting the reduction of hsp40, and up-regulating the expression of hsp70. Our study indicated that ischemic postconditioning is an effective method to rescue the neuronal death caused by ischemia and reperfusion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by National Nature and Science Foundation (30973110) and (81171234), and the outstanding youth grant (20080139) from the science and technology department of Jilin Province.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Taraszewska</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Zelman</surname><given-names>IB</given-names></name><name><surname>Ogonowska</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Chrzanowska</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><article-title>The pattern of irreversible brain changes after cardiac arrest in humans</article-title><source>Folia Neuropathol</source><year>2002</year><volume>40</volume><fpage>133</fpage><lpage>41</lpage>
