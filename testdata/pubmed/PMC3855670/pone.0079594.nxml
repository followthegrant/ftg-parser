However, two factors have limited the effectiveness of microtubule inhibitors: toxicity and resistance. In particular, the latter is highly unpredictable, variable from patient to patient and is believed to be the cause of treatment failure in most cases of metastatic cancers. For these reasons, there is an increasing demand for new microtubule inhibitors that can overcome resistance mechanisms and that, at the same time, have reduced side effects. Here we present a novel microtubule inhibitor, 4SC-207, which shows strong anti-proliferative activity in a large panel of tumor cell lines with an average GI<sub>50</sub> of 11nM. In particular, 4SC-207 is active in multi-drug resistant cell lines, such as HCT-15 and ACHN, suggesting that it is a poor substrate for drug efflux pumps. 4SC-207 inhibits microtubule growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and promotes, in a dose dependent manner, a mitotic delay/arrest, followed by apoptosis or aberrant divisions due to chromosome alignment defects and formation of multi-polar spindles. Furthermore, preliminary data from preclinical studies suggest low propensity towards bone marrow toxicities at concentrations that inhibit tumor growth in paclitaxel-resistant xenograft models. In summary, our results suggest that 4SC-207 may be a potential anti-cancer agent.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>L.S. is supported by the University of Konstanz, Department of Biology.

While side effects are well understood and are usually manageable by dose reduction and/or dose interval, drug resistance poses problems to long-term usage of MTIs and has been estimated to be the cause for treatment failure in &#x0003e;90% of patients with metastatic disease [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. </p><p>MTIs bind to soluble or polymerized tubulin and, by doing so, affect microtubule dynamics [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Microtubules are polymers composed of &#x003b1;,&#x003b2; tubulin dimers that can exist in a growing or a shrinking phase. This dynamic behavior allows microtubules to fulfill most of their functions that range from intracellular transport to cell shape maintenance, from cell polarity to cell signaling and cell division [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>MTIs are classified into two main groups: microtubule-stabilizing agents (such as taxanes and epothilones), which stimulate microtubule polymerization, and microtubule-destabilizing agents (such as vinca alkaloids, colchicine and halichondrins), which inhibit microtubule polymerization [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This classification holds true at high MTI concentrations, while at 10 to 100-fold lower concentrations both classes are known to suppress microtubule dynamics without affecting the amount of total polymer mass [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In mitosis, where dynamic microtubules are crucial for proper spindle function, suppression of microtubule dynamics will inhibit the correct assembly of the mitotic spindle, activate the spindle assembly checkpoint and subsequently promote mitotic delay or arrest followed either by aberrant divisions or cell death [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. </p><p>Even though the mechanism by which MTIs promote mitotic arrest is well understood, relatively little is known about how MTIs act in the context of a tumor and why drug sensitivity varies amongst different cancers, i.e. why taxol is effective against ovarian and mammary tumors but is ineffective against other solid tumors such as kidney and colon carcinomas. In addition, once a tumor becomes insensitive to a certain drug it will also show resistance to drugs whose structure and mechanism of action may be completely different (a phenomenon known as multi-drug resistance or MDR [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). Drug sensitivity (inherent resistance) and the development of resistance during treatment are thought to be mediated by multiple mechanisms such as increased drug efflux, drug inactivation, mutations in the target protein and evasion of drug-induced damage or apoptosis [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. </p><p>For all these reasons, there is a constant demand for novel anti-cancer agents that could provide new treatment options by overcoming resistance mechanisms and, therefore, extending survival duration while minimizing toxicity and maintaining high quality of life.</p><p>In the past ten years, efforts have concentrated either on the development of mitosis-specific drugs that do not target tubulin but are inhibitors of key mitotic regulators such as aurora kinases, polo-like kinase I or the kinesin protein family (currently all in clinical development) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], or on the discovery of new MTIs that, due to novel chemical properties, can overcome MDR induced by the classical MTIs.</p><p>Epothilones [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and halichondrins [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] are examples of novel MTIs. Agents from both classes of compounds have shown very promising results in <italic>in vitro</italic> and pre-clinical studies in taxane-resistant cells and are in early stages of clinical development [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Here we characterize the mode of action of 4SC-207, identified in a small molecule screen as a novel cytotoxic agent. 4SC-207 inhibits proliferation in many tumor cell lines, including multi-drug resistance cell lines such as HCT-15 and ACHN. We demonstrate that 4SC-207 targets tubulin and acts as a microtubule destabilizing agent. It inhibits microtubule growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and promotes, in a dose dependent manner, a mitotic delay/arrest followed by aberrant divisions or apoptosis. Additionally, 4SC-207 inhibits tumor growth in taxane resistant xenograft models and displays very low toxicity against bone marrow cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Ethic Statement</title><p>The xenograft models were conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes, 7th Edition, 2004 (National Health and Medical Research Council).

Approximately 9hrs after thymidine release, cells entered mitosis with similar kinetics independent of the treatment, suggesting that 4SC-207, like nocodazole, does not influence cell cycle timing prior to mitosis. For each condition, we scored 300 mitotic events from three independent experiments and documented whether i) cells were able to complete mitosis (in a normal or aberrant fashion), ii) cells were arrested in mitosis for the duration of the movie, iii) cells died during mitosis. Additionally, for those cells in the first category, we measured the time period from nuclear envelope breakdown (corresponding to cell rounding up) to anaphase onset and defined this as mitotic duration.

We, therefore, performed immunofluorescence-staining experiments on HeLa wt cells synchronized with thymidine, treated with 4SC-207 or nocodazole, and fixed 9-10hrs after thymidine release, when most cells have entered mitosis. While in DMSO treated cells spindles were bipolar and all chromosomes were correctly aligned on the metaphase plate, in cells treated with 4SC-207 or nocodazole many chromosomes were misaligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079594-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) and we observed that the degree of the alignment defect correlated with the appearance of multi-polar spindles. To follow the development of the phenotype rather than to capture only the end point event, we carried out high-resolution live-cell imaging experiments on HeLa cells stably expressing chromosome and microtubule markers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079594.s001">Video S1</xref> for control cells, Video S2 and S3 for 4SC-207 treated cells). In 4SC-207 treated samples, most cells assembled an initial bipolar spindle in which some chromosomes were correctly aligned while others remained close to one or both poles. Congression of the unaligned chromosomes was a very slow process, often not completed due to loss of spindle integrity and the appearance of extra poles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079594.s002">Video S2</xref>). The cells that completed mitosis, experienced in addition karyokinesis or cytokinesis defects that resulted in bi or multinucleated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079594.s003">Video S3</xref>). To evaluate whether multi-polarity is a characteristic phenotype of 4SC-207 (and nocodazole) treated cells, we counted over 100 mitotic events for each treatment from three independent live-cell imaging experiments and categorized spindles into three groups: bipolar, ball-like and multi-polar. We defined as ball-like those spindles that, compared to bi- or multi-polar spindles, showed a much higher degree of disorganization with no aligned chromosomes and disordered microtubule structures. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079594-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, 60% of 4SC-207 (and nocodazole) treated cells resulted in multi-polar spindles while in control treated cells &#x0003e;90% of the spindles were bipolar. </p><p>In summary, all the imaging data, from both live and fixed samples, suggest that 4SC-207 affects the process of chromosome congression: the similarities between the phenotypes of 4SC-207 and nocodazole treated cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079594.s004">Video S4</xref> for nocodazole treatment) lead us to speculate that 4SC-207 may also directly target tubulin and affect microtubule dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s3.3"><title>4SC-207 inhibits tubulin polymerization and reduces microtubule growth speeds</title><p>To test whether 4SC-207 is a MTI and whether it perturbs microtubule dynamics either by directly interfering with tubulin polymerization or indirectly by inhibiting the binding of microtubule associated proteins, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> microtubule polymerization assay [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

For this reason there is a strong need for new chemotherapeutic agents that could provide effective treatment in second-line therapy, or whenever classical MTIs fail. </p><p>Here we identify 4SC-207 that could respond to such demands. 4SC-207 belongs to the chemical class of tetrahydrothieno pyridines and so far this compound class had not been described to have anti-mitotic or microtubule inhibiting activities.</p><p>We demonstrate that 4SC-207 inhibits tubulin polymerization <italic>in vivo</italic>. The target is tubulin as confirmed by the <italic>in vitro</italic> tubulin polymerization assay where 4SC-207 inhibits in a dose dependent manner polymerization of purified pig-brain tubulin. Low doses of 4SC-207 (as shown for known MTIs [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) strongly reduce the rate and extent of microtubule growth. Consistent with the accepted idea that MTIs induce mitotic defects as a result of suppressed microtubule dynamics [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], it is not surprising that cells treated with 4SC-207 are delayed in mitosis, unable to complete chromosome alignment or maintain a formed metaphase plate. Additionally, in many cells, spindles were disorganized and unstable due to the appearance of extra poles. Low doses of destabilizers have been shown to promote fragmentation of centrosomal material [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or the formation of extra nucleation sites [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In both 4SC-207 and nocodazole treated cells, these extra poles were not <italic>bona fide</italic> centrosomes as centriolar markers was not detected (data not shown) but we speculate that they could be extra nucleation sites that arise following perturbations in microtubule dynamics. </p><p>Prolonged mitotic arrest has been associated with uncoordinated loss of chromatid cohesion or centriole disengagements events [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However this phenotype has never been observed in conditions where microtubule dynamics were affected (such as in the presence of MTIs), suggesting that microtubule forces are required to destabilize cohesion. In cells treated with 4SC-207, we observed neither chromosome scattering nor centriole disengagement suggesting indirectly that the compound is targeting microtubule dynamics and therefore impairing the microtubule forces required for both phenotypes. </p><p>Recently, another two MTIs, ixabepilone and eribulin, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic breast cancers that become refractory to anthracyclines and taxanes [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While ixabepilone belongs to the class of epothilones and is a microtubule-stabilizing agent, eribulin is a derivative of the halichondrin family and is a microtubule destabilizer. Regardless of their mode of action, the reason why they were approved for treatment of metastatic tumors is because both MTIs are active in taxane-resistant tumors that have developed mutations in &#x003b2;-tubulin [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], or that overexpress the &#x003b2;III-tubulin isotype, to which paclitaxel binds with reduced affinity [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. </p><p>We tested 4SC-207 on a panel of cells derived from 50 solid tumors (from 14 different tissues) and we show that 4SC-207 is active at low nM concentrations in most cells, suggesting high potency and a very broad spectrum of activity. More importantly, amongst the cells tested we observed that 4SC-207 was also active in multi-drug resistance cell lines. DLD-1, HCT-15, ACHN and UO-31 cell lines are all known to be taxane-resistant due to overexpression of drug efflux pumps such as the ABC transporter P-glycoprotein (PgP) [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This suggests that 4SC-207 is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein and therefore it has the potential to be active in multi-drug resistant tumors that acquire resistance due to overexpression of PgP pumps. Epothilones are also not affected by overexpression of P-glycoprotein, even though the level of susceptibility was shown to be influenced by the substitutions present on the core structure of ephothilones [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], while, on the contrary, eribulin showed decreased <italic>in vitro</italic> activity in PgP expressing cells [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. </p><p>The potential of 4SC-207 to overcome MDR was confirmed also in the context of a tumor, in a HCT-15 derived human xenograft model (also taxane-resistant), where we observed that 4SC-207 retains activity and, in a dose dependent manner, reduces tumor growth, whereas paclitaxel, just like the vehicle control, does not influence tumor growth. In addition paclitaxel treated animals experience weight loss, while effective concentrations of 4SC-207 do not affect the health of the animals. This suggests that the concentration at which 4SC-207 is active in the tumor is below the concentration that would promote toxic effects. </p><p>The balance between activity and toxicity is often the reason why MTIs cannot be administered at the dose that would be effective, because of the occurrence of severe side effects. The most commonly associated toxicities are the result of perturbations of microtubules in non-malignant cells, such as neutrophils and neurons. Neutrophils are the first line of defense against infections and, therefore, reduction in their number (termed neutropenia) can predispose patients to severe infections that, if not life-threatening, would compromise the outcome of the chemotherapy. Neurons are, on the contrary, non-dividing cells but are characterized by a very articulate and extensive microtubule network that is essential for their function. Epothilones and halichondrins represent a step forward compared to the classical MTIs because, together with the ability to overcome resistance, they also present a more manageable side effect profile. Both compounds are associated with neutropenia and neuropathy, however the incidence of febrile neutropenia (the highest degree of severity) and severe neuropathy are below 10% [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We do not have sufficient data to compare the side effect profile of 4SC-207 with that of eribulin and ixabepilone, however, the results of the CFU-GM assays are very encouraging as we show that mouse and human bone marrow derived cells can tolerate dosages of 4SC-207 that are 50 to 100-fold higher than the concentrations that induce proliferation defects in tumor cells, suggesting that neutropenia may not be dose limiting.</p><p>In summary, we identify 4SC-207 as a novel MTI. By combining strong anti-proliferative activity with reduced toxicity and the ability to overcome MDR, 4SC-207 shows great potential as an anti-cancer agent. Our data strongly support further investigations, especially concerning its mode of action and its activity in MDR cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0079594.s001"><label>Video S1</label><caption><p>
