Using a calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation model we investigated the interaction between epidermal differentiation and VZV infection. RNA-seq analysis showed that VZV infection has a profound effect on differentiating keratinocytes, altering the normal process of epidermal gene expression to generate a signature that resembles patterns of gene expression seen in both heritable and acquired skin-blistering disorders. Further investigation by real-time PCR, protein analysis and electron microscopy revealed that VZV specifically reduced expression of specific suprabasal cytokeratins and desmosomal proteins, leading to disruption of epidermal structure and function. These changes were accompanied by an upregulation of kallikreins and serine proteases. Taken together VZV infection promotes blistering and desquamation of the epidermis, both of which are necessary to the viral spread and pathogenesis. At the same time, analysis of the viral transcriptome provided evidence that VZV gene expression was significantly increased following calcium treatment of keratinocytes. Using reporter viruses and immunohistochemistry we confirmed that VZV gene and protein expression in skin is linked with cellular differentiation. These studies highlight the intimate host-pathogen interaction following VZV infection of skin and provide insight into the mechanisms by which VZV remodels the epidermal environment to promote its own replication and spread.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles, which are characterised by the formation of fluid-filled skin lesions. Infectious viral particles present in these lesions are critical for airborne spread to cause chickenpox in non-immune contacts and for infection of nerve ganglia via nerve endings in the skin, a pre-requisite for shingles. Several VZV proteins, although dispensable in laboratory cell-culture, are essential for VZV infection of skin, a finding thought to relate to VZV interaction with a process known as epidermal differentiation. In this, the specialised keratinocyte cells of the outer layer of skin, the epidermis, are continually shed to be replaced by differentiating keratinocytes, which migrate up from lower layers. How VZV interaction with epidermal differentiation leads to the formation of fluid-filled lesions remains unclear. We show using a keratinocyte model of epidermal differentiation that VZV infection alters epidermal differentiation, generating a specific pattern of changes in that is characteristic of blistering and skin shedding diseases. We also identified that the differentiation status of the keratinocytes influences the replication pattern of the viral gene and protein expression, with both increasing as the VZV particles traverses to the uppermost layers of the skin. The findings provide new insights into VZV-host cell interactions.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by MRC grant G0700814 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/index.htm">http://www.mrc.ac.uk/index.htm</ext-link>), Wellcome Trust grant 081703/B/06/Z (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk">http://www.wellcome.ac.uk</ext-link>), and NIH grants NS064022 and EY08098 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">http://www.nih.gov</ext-link>).

In both diseases, VZV replication in the epidermal layer of skin results in the formation of large polykaryocytes and the development of blisters containing infectious cell-free virus. The epidermis is a continually regenerating tissue layer that develops a stratified structure, which is maintained by keratinocytes, specialized cells which produce a network of keratin filaments anchored to intracellular junctions to provide structural support to the tissue. As keratinocytes transit from the stem-cell rich basal to the uppermost layer of the epidermis, they undergo a program of terminal differentiation. Each stratum (basal, spinous, granular, lucidum and cornified) <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Eckert1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> identified within the stratified epidermis is associated with established signature patterns of gene expression <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>
<xref rid="ppat.1003896-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This process is tightly regulated by homeostatic mechanisms that involve calcium gradients, microRNAs, developmental signalling pathways and proteolytic cascades <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Bikle1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Bikle2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Blanpain1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Fessing1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Hildebrand1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Ovaere1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Although VZV infects primary cultured keratinocytes <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Sexton1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> little is known about the interaction between VZV replication and epidermal differentiation. Previous work has shown that VZV replication in skin differs from monolayer cultures in that certain VZV proteins, such as ORF10 and ORF11, are not required for replication in melanoma monolayer cultures but are necessary for optimal replication in foetal skin xenografts of SCID-hu mice, <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Che1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Che2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Additionally, the live attenuated VZV vaccine, vOKA, replicates well in tissue culture but is attenuated for replication in skin but not in lymphoid or neuronal xenografts in SCID-hu mouse models <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Moffat1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> calcium induced model of epithelial differentiation <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Bikle2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and analysed the transcriptome of uninfected and VZV-infected primary keratinocytes using RNA-seq. This approach identified not only the effect of VZV on keratinocytes but also the consequence of keratinocyte differentiation on VZV replication and maturation. Together our data provides intriguing new insights into host&#x02013;pathogen interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>VZV infection of primary keratinocytes</title><p>As keratinocytes differentiate they lose basally expressed cytokeratins (KRT5/14/15) and increase the expression of differentiation markers e.g. suprabasal cytokeratins (KRT1/10) and involucrin (IVL). The addition of calcium to primary keratinocytes in culture, mimics the calcium gradient across the epidermis and the process of epidermal differentiation <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Bikle2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. To assess the effect of calcium on primary keratinocytes we measured by qPCR the change in the expression of selected keratinocyte markers known to be altered by differentiation (KRT10, KRT15 and IVL) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003896.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and confirmed our findings by immunoblotting for KRT10 and IVL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003896.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In our hands, the addition of calcium to 1.2 mM increased the expression of the suprabasal (KRT10) and granular marker (IVL) as well as reducing the expression of the basal marker (KRT15), demonstrating that we could use calcium to induce keratinocyte differentiation.</p><p>The ability of VZV to infect primary human keratinocytes has previously been assessed <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Sexton1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Sexton and colleagues noted that maintaining the keratinocytes in a low calcium media prior to VZV infection resulted in a higher initial infection. We were able to infect cells grown in low calcium [0.6 mM] (&#x02212;calcium) and high calcium [1.2 mM] (+calcium) media with VZV as detected by an infectious centre assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;B</xref>). Over the course of a 5 day infection we observed an increase in the number of VZV foci, indicating cell to cell spread, full replication and production of infectious virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As previously observed <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Sexton1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> when VZV was added to cells cultured in high calcium medium, the number of foci was less and plateaued after one day, suggesting reduced replication and spread. To optimise a model with which to investigate the interaction of VZV and keratinocyte differentiation, we next examined the effect of adding calcium [1.2 mM] to cells already infected with VZV. By immunohistochemistry, the VZV plaque size was comparable to the &#x02212;calcium cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;B</xref>), but the number of foci counted was still less when calcium was added 3 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Primary keratinocytes in culture are known to change size <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Barrandon1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, develop tight junctions and form clusters <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Hennings1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> when treated with calcium. To ensure that this did not affect the number of VZV plaques counted, the infected keratinocytes and the associated supernatants were transferred onto MeWo cells and the VZV titres calculated. VZV was not detected in the supernatants of any sample (data not shown). The VZV titre in the +calcium cells at days 4&#x02013;5 p.i. was significantly less than in the &#x02212;calcium cells. However, by adding the calcium to the cells 3 days after VZV infection, the VZV titres were higher than in the +calcium cells and by day 5 no significant difference was seen in the VZV titres between the &#x02212;calcium cells and the cells which the calcium had been added 3 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of VZV keratinocytes confirmed that keratinocytes cultured in high calcium media (+calcium) express fewer VZV proteins than the cells culture in low calcium media (&#x02212;calcium) but this could be increased by adding calcium at 3 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003896.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Moreover, this finding was independent of whether cell-associated or cell-free VZV was used to infect cells. VZV gene expression (ORF29) was compared by real time PCR in cells grown in low calcium media (&#x02212;calcium) and cells switched to a high calcium media at day 3 post VZV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).

Although approximately the same viral titres were achieved in both conditions, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) significantly more genes were differentially expressed in the KCV/KC comparison (1049 upregulated, 371 downregulated).

As we could not achieve 100% infection in either the KCV or KV samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g001">Figure 1</xref>), we must consider that the uninfected bystander cells in these samples could also contribute to the overall gene expression changes observed.</p><p>Only 31 genes were found to be differentially expressed in both virally infected (KV/K) and calcium treated (KC/K) conditions (19% KV/K, 2% KC/K) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), strongly suggesting that viral infection does not drive differentiation. A similar analysis of the KCV/KC and KC/K comparisons identified 238 genes as differentially expressed in both contrasts (17% KCV/KC, 13% KC/K). However of these genes, 159 were upregulated in the KCV/KC comparison but downregulated in KC/K, whilst 73 were downregulated in the KCV/KC but upregulated in the KC/K comparison. The direction of changes was the same for only 3% (6/238) of those genes differentially expressed in both conditions. This finding further supports the contention that VZV infection does not drive differentiation and raises the possibility that VZV may in fact interfere with or hinder it. Some of the effects seen in the VZV infected samples that were calcium switched (KCV) were also apparent in VZV infected samples that were untreated (KV). However the differences were not due solely to the effect of calcium on keratinocytes. If this were the case, we ought to see good agreement between those genes differentially expressed in both KCV/KV and KC/K. That this overlap is relatively small (85 genes: 5% total KC/K; 9% total KCV/KV) is in keeping with the observation that the KCV samples were transcriptionally distinct from both KC and K samples and reinforces the notion of an interaction between VZV infection and the process of keratinocyte differentiation.</p><p>In addition, there is only a relatively small overlap between genes differentially expressed following addition of calcium and those differentially expressed upon addition of calcium and viral infection (215 genes, 12% KC/K, 16% KCV/K). Of these genes, the direction of fold change is identical for almost all (91%, 50 genes upregulated in both comparisons, 145 genes downregulated in both comparisons) suggesting the KCV samples possess a more differentiated keratinocyte phenotype than the K samples. However, the vast majority of genes found to be differentially expressed in the KCV/K comparison (1113 genes, 84% KCV/K) are not significantly up- or downregulated by the addition of calcium alone, further supporting the notion that changes in gene expression between the K and KCV samples are not solely a consequence of keratinocyte differentiation.</p><p>Gene set enrichment analysis using the online DAVID functional annotation resource <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Huangda1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> identified significantly enriched functional groups (P<sub>BH</sub>&#x0003c;0.05) altered by either calcium (KC/K) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), by VZV infection of calcium differentiated cells (KCV/KC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) or by VZV infection of undifferentiated cells (KV/K) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Genes upregulated by calcium treatment of uninfected keratinocytes (KC/K) showed enrichment for several functional groups including cell cycle (GO:0007049) and cell division (SwissProt PIR keyword) whilst those that were downregulated in this comparison included regulation of transcription (GO:0045449) and negative regulation of gene expression (GO:0010629). The categories identified in the KCV/KC comparison were more varied with enrichment in the upregulated genes for several functional groups including cell junction genes (GO:0030054), the ECM-receptor interaction pathway (KEGG hsa04512) and serine protease inhibitors (SwissProt keyword). Enrichment was also observed for additional groups such as cell adhesion (GO:0007155), epidermis development (GO:0008544), serine proteases (SwissProt PIR keyword) and the integrin-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0007229). Although relatively few genes were significantly altered by viral infection alone (KV/K), the upregulated genes showed functional enrichment for epidermis development (GO:0008544) and serine-type endopeptidase activity (GO:0004252) as observed for KCV/KC.

Basal cytokeratins (KRT5/14/15) are lost and suprabasal cytokeratins (KRT1/10) are gained as the keratinocytes differentiate and migrate outwards. Gene-annotation enrichment analysis using the online DAVID database of both the KCV/KC and KV/K deduced that infection with VZV profoundly affected the development of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g003">Figure 3B&#x02013;C</xref>). Specifically, we show here that VZV alters the expression of several epidermal cytokeratins, regardless of the differentiation status of the keratinocyte (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003896.s005">Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003896.s008">Table S2</xref>). The effect of VZV infection on the epithelial cytokeratins was independently verified by qPCR and the fold change calculated for a direct comparison to the RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g004">Figure 4A&#x02013;B</xref>). A good concordance was seen between the methods. VZV infection increased the expression of KRT15, a stem cell marker located in the hair follicle isthmus in both the KCV/KC and KV/K comparisons, although other stem cell markers (ITGB1, CD34 and CD200) (data not shown) and other basal layer cytokeratins (KRT5/14) were not altered. At the same time, VZV either down-regulated or prevented up regulation of the suprabasally expressed cytokeratin heterodimers KRT1 and KRT10, which are the major cytokeratins associated with keratinocyte differentiation <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Fuchs2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> in both the KCV/KC and KV/K comparisons. EM images of differentiated keratinocytes infected with VZV show an abundance of cytokeratin structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003896.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This finding may be related to the upregulation of KRT4/13 (131-fold and 34-fold respectively for the KCV/KC comparison, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g004">figure 4A</xref>), KRT4/13 are normally present as heterodimers in the suprabasal layers of mucosal but not stratified epithelium <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Moll1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and are thought to function like KRT1/10 to maintain cellular architecture. Upregulation of KRT4/13 may therefore have compensated structurally for the reduced expression of KRT1/10. To test whether VZV replication was responsible for the reduction of KRT1/10 expression, the qPCR experiment was repeated with UV-inactivated VZV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g004">Figure 4C&#x02013;D</xref>). We again saw a downregulation of the KRT1 and KRT10 gene expression, but these changes were partially abolished by pre-treatment of the viral inoculum by UV irradiation. We also determined the effect of VZV infection on KRT10 and KRT15 protein expression by western blotting. KRT10 expression was increased by the addition of calcium by 24 hrs. However, in the VZV infected cells the KRT10 levels were reduced and this reduction was more pronounced by 48 hrs p.i. in the undifferentiated cells, confirming that the virus downregulates KRT10 regardless of the differentiation status of the cell. KRT15 expression was upregulated by VZV infection at 48 hrs p.i. and again this effect was not dependent on the addition of calcium. Further examination of the VZV infected keratinocytes by immunofluorescence confirmed that not all cells were infected at day 5 p.i. but, KRT10 expression was absent in the ORF23GFP expressing cells. However, KRT15 expression was widespread and not necessarily confined to the VZV infected cells, confirming that not all the gene changes seen in our transcriptome data was a direct result of VZV infected cells and that changes in the bystander cells also contribute to the changes seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g004">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-1003896-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1003896.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>VZV infection dysregulates the expression of epidermal cytokeratins.</title><p>

The increase in viral gene expression was independently investigated by qPCR analysis for the three temporal classes of herpesvirus genes. No difference was seen in the expression of the IE gene (ORF63) at 48 hrs after the addition of calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g009">Figure 9C</xref>), however the expression of the early (ORF29) and late (ORF14) viral genes was significantly increased in cells where calcium was added 3 days after VZV infection as per our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g009">Figure 9D&#x02013;E</xref>). The qPCR data did not reflect the degree of change and increase in VZV gene expression seen in the KCV samples in RNA-seq data in comparison to the KV samples.

Taken together, our data, whereby calcium induced differentiation of primary keratinocytes increases VZV DNA replication and gene transcription, both of which are required for the production of progeny virions implies that the process of differentiation increases VZV replication, but, we were unable to demonstrate that calcium differentiation induced an increase in the number of VZV particles or replication by either IF, infectious VZV foci or EM (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Pattern of VZV gene expression is altered by keratinocyte differentiation</title><p>In common with other members of the herpesvirus family, VZV gene expression occurs in a temporally regulated cascade, which can be categorized as; immediate early (IE), early (E) and late (L). When viral reads were normalised separately to human reads, distinct patterns of relative viral gene expression were observed for the undifferentiated (KV) and differentiated (KCV) samples within each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). A high degree of agreement was observed between the differentiated samples (KCV1&#x02013;3) indicating that late viral genes were more highly expressed than immediate early genes in the differentiated samples. Undifferentiated samples KV3 and KV4 also showed good agreement, where in contrast to KCV1&#x02013;3, the immediate early genes were more highly expressed than the late genes. However, samples KV2 and KV5, despite not having been treated with calcium, had similar viral gene expression patterns to the differentiated cells (KCV1&#x02013;3). Analysis of 1463 host genes which are differentially expressed after treatment with calcium but not changed by VZV infection (i.e. representative of keratinocyte differentiation) showed clustering of KV2 and KV5 host gene expression profiles with the calcium-shifted differentiated keratinocyte samples KCV1&#x02013;3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). This finding was supported by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003896.s003">Figure S3</xref>) and principal component analysis of host gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003896.s003">Figure S3</xref>), which again clustered samples KV2 and KV5 with the calcium treated samples.

These data illustrate the impact of keratinocyte differentiation on VZV gene expression as distinct from the effect of calcium. To test our hypothesis that it is differentiation and not the addition of calcium that is responsible for the increase seen in VZV gene expression, the NOTCH pathway was activated by the addition of the agonist, jagged-1 and inhibited by the addition of DAPT. The canonical NOTCH pathway acts as a switch between the basal and suprabasal genes and is a key regulator of keratinocyte differentiation and its activation causes stem cells to exit their niche and start the process of terminal differentiation <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Fuchs3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. NOTCH activation and ablation influenced gE expression as measured by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g010">Figure 10C</xref>). gE expression was increased in comparison to the untreated keratinocytes, when the NOTCH pathway was activated.

Keratinocytes were infected with one of the three viruses as per our model and the reporter activity measured over the course of 6 days. Reporter activity for ORF4, ORF14 and ORF9 increased over the timepoints taken whereas ORF63 remained relatively level. In all viruses, the reporter activity was altered by the addition of calcium at day 3 post infection. With the reporter driven by an immediate early promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g010">Figure 10D and F</xref>) there was a decrease in its activity after the addition of calcium whereas the converse was true for the reporters driven by the late promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g010">Figure 10E and G</xref>). The increase in ORF4 promoter activity in undifferentiated cells and not in the calcium treated cells as well as the increase in the late viral promoter activity and viral early and late gene products in the calcium differentiated cells suggests that there was a relative block to viral replication which was overcome by keratinocyte differentiation.</p><p>To investigate if the expression of the VZV proteins is affected by differentiation in the epidermis, skin organ cultures were intradermally injected with VZV to model skin infection and stained for IE and late proteins 3 days post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003896-g010">Figure 10H</xref>).

VZV IE63 staining was found predominantly in the nuclei throughout the epidermis and the expression of late viral glycoprotein gE was largely cytoplasmic with increased expression of gE seen in the uppermost layers of the epidermis. Together with the observed differential gene expression as keratinocytes differentiate under calcium, these results indicate that VZV gene expression is tied to regulated keratinocyte differentiation, with a switch from more efficient early gene expression at the undifferentiated stage to late gene expression as differentiation ensues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Keratinocytes, the predominant cell type found in the epidermis, are a major target of VZV replication in skin. The calcium switch method delivered a dynamic model of epidermal differentiation which can be manipulated to allow investigation of viral and host interactions during synchronized keratinocyte differentiation without the presence of other cell types.</p><p>A number of alternative systems have been described to investigate the biology of skin, including 3D raft cultures and explants <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Andrei1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Taylor2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

<xref rid="ppat.1003896-Moffat1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Both the 3D raft cultures and the explants show a greater degree of differentiation, formation and definition of the structural layers characteristic of skin in contrast to the calcium shift model utilised in this study. Furthermore, the explant system also contains the presence of specialised structures, such as the sebaceous glands and hair follicles that are absent from raft cultures and the monolayer system. However neither the explant nor the SCID-hu mouse model was suitable for this study as neither system can be manipulated experimentally to allow the effects of differentiation on VZV gene expression to be examined. In contrast, the development of 3D organotypic rafts whilst offering a valid alternative model to allow investigation into the effects of virus infection on cellular differentiation and vice versa was not found to be reliable enough, particularly in the presence of virus, for use in the RNA-seq part of our study.</p><p>The model has certain disadvantages e.g. the genes associated with the stratum lucidum and stratum corneum are not expressed. The titre of virus produced in primary keratinocytes is at least 2 logs lower than is seen in MeWo cells and remains highly cell associated as we saw in our EM images. Thus although we were able to show that calcium induced increases in gene expression and viral genome replication, these were not associated with an increase in the formation of infectious particles. Nonetheless, our data clearly demonstrate that, in common with the archetypal alphaherpesvirus HSV-1 <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Schelhaas1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and previous observations <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Sexton1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Andrei1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, VZV appears to preferentially infect undifferentiated keratinocytes. In epithelia, undifferentiated keratinocytes are localised to the stem-cell rich basal layer of the epidermis and adnexal structures. Our findings are consistent with histological evidence of early Herpes Zoster lesions that shows VZV infecting the stem-cell rich isthmus region of the hair follicle <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Muraki1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, following reactivation from latency and prior to the onset of the epidermal infection or distinctive cutaneous rash. By adding calcium to VZV infected undifferentiated keratinocytes our model therefore mimics the likely sequence of events in the skin, with infection of less differentiated basal cells followed by differentiation of infected cells. The fact that VZV spreads more easily in undifferentiated cells fits with the model of cell associated virus inhabiting basal epidermal layers while cell free virus in the upper epidermis is necessary for transmitted infection <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Virus adapted for cell to cell spread in the basal epithelium has been shown to differ from cell-free virus. For example, VZV can spread efficiently cell to cell in MeWo monolayers despite low levels of envelope glycoprotein C <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Storlie1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> a protein that is necessary for the formation of cell free virus and VZV replication in skin <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Moffat1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Storlie2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This fits with our results showing increased late viral protein expression in the suprabasal layers where assembly of cell free virus occurs <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. One model to explain our results may therefore be that the generalised increase in viral gene and protein expression seen with keratinocyte differentiation is directed to maturation of cell-free virions from the immature viral particles formed in the basal layers, rather than a large increase in numbers of virions. Over time, as keratinocyte maturation continues, high titers of cell-free virions accumulate in the growing blister.</p><p>The blister lesions formed in VZV infections are by and large discrete, although coalescence of mature lesions may occur. While production of interferon by bystander cells has been shown to limit viral spread in the skin <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> it is also possible that cell-to-cell spread is limited by the physical barriers associated with keratinocyte differentiation, thus explaining the reduced spread of virus observed in differentiated cells. Alternatively, differentiation may result in the loss of a cellular receptor rendering keratinocytes less permissive to VZV infection. Of the three known putative cellular receptors for VZV, mannose 6 phosphate receptor, reported to be critical for the accumulation of cell free virus in vesicles and Heparan sulphate are expressed only in basal layers and the expression of both are lost as keratinocytes differentiate <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>
<xref rid="ppat.1003896-Jung1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Both are therefore candidates for viral spread in less differentiated but not differentiated cells. In contrast, expression of the third putative receptor, insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), increases as keratinocytes differentiate (Jones M. unpublished data).</p><p>Notwithstanding the reduced cell-to-cell spread in differentiated keratinocytes, our analysis revealed a quantitative increase in viral gene and viral DNA expression after calcium induced differentiation and by manipulation of the NOTCH pathway as well as by calcium and contact induced differentiation we were able to show that this was dependent on differentiation and not just the addition of calcium to our cells. As previously outlined, these results are not necessarily contradictory but are consistent with a model by which the virus is able to enter and spread in undifferentiated keratinocytes, but once infected, optimal replication and production of mature virions requires the presence or loss of cellular factors present as cells differentiate. Although VZV does not persist in the skin, it shows a pattern common to other skin tropic viruses. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) which maintains its genome as a stable episome in basal cells until differentiation of the host cell occurs <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Hummel1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and the gamma-herpesviruses Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV), whose lytic cycle is also known to be activated by keratinocyte differentiation <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>In our model, expression of all VZV ORFs was evident in both untreated and calcium treated keratinocyte samples, confirming that VZV undergoes full lytic infection in both conditions. However, the distinct differences in the pattern of expression were clearly apparent, with relatively more immediate early genes (ORFs 4, 62 and 63) in the undifferentiated cells and relatively more late genes (e.g. viral glycoproteins) expressed in the keratinocytes that had undergone synchronized differentiation. The apparent association of each condition with IE or late viral gene expression suggests that the state of the host cell may impact on the regulation of the molecular switch controlling the classical temporal pattern of herpesvirus gene expression. Though not definitive proof, this hypothesis is supported by our observations. First, the expression of the VZV promoters in the recombinant viruses clearly establishes differential activity of the reporters in response to calcium induced keratinocyte differentiation. This block in production of early and late viral proteins in undifferentiated keratinocytes is consistent with a requirement for cellular factors present in differentiated cells to regulate the switch to early/late gene expression. Secondly, the expression of gC, which is essential for viral replication in skin <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Moffat1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, was significantly greater in the calcium switched cells. This result corroborates previous work where increased gC expression was observed in MeWo cells treated with hexamethyl bisacetamide (HMBA), a known inducer of cellular differentiation <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Storlie1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Finally, using immunohistochemistry we were also able to show that another late protein, gE, was more highly expressed in the upper layers of the epidermis in explants.</p><p>Of interest, several VZV ORFs which, based on their HSV-1 orthologues are presumed to be late genes, were more highly expressed in the undifferentiated cells. These include ORFs 17 (virion host shutoff), 64 (tegument U<sub>S</sub>10), 46 (tegument U<sub>L</sub>14), 27 (nuclear phosphoprotein U<sub>L</sub>31), 60 (gL) and 23 (capsid). Further work is required to determine whether these findings reflect true differences in VZV temporal gene expression or whether they are indicative of keratinocyte specific differences in the gene expression patterns.</p><p>Analysis of the host transcriptome confirmed VZV does not drive keratinocyte differentiation. Instead the virus clearly alters the normal pattern of gene expression associated with differentiation, generating a signature associated with skin blistering, which itself is a characteristic feature of VZV disease. VZV downregulated or prevented the expression of the suprabasal genes, KRT1 and KRT10, but was not shown to alter the expression of other differentiation markers such as involucrin. <italic>KRT1 and</italic> KRT10 are known to play a role in maintaining the integrity of the epidermis and are mutated in other blistering diseases such as epidermolytic ichthyosis <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Uitto1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. KRT10 has also been shown to inhibit proliferation and cell cycle progression of basal keratinocytes <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Paramio1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Koch1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and its loss is also associated with increased cell turnover <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Reichelt2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, through its interactions with desmosomes, KRT1/10 form a dynamic scaffold in the cell and play an important role in maintaining epithelial structure <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Wallace1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Autoantibodies to desmosomal proteins, DSG1 and DSC1 proteins are a hallmark of blistering skin conditions including pemphigus foliaceus and IgA pemphigus <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Descargues1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. As a group, the desmosomal genes, especially DSG1 and DSC1 were identified as being significantly altered by VZV infection while other junctional proteins were unaltered. These findings support the notion that the interaction of VZV with keratinocytes drives the pathognomonic blistering phenotype. The accompanying upregulation of the serine proteases by VZV may contribute to the observed reduction of DSG1 protein as well as inducing a desquamative phenotype, which may promote the dissemination of the virus.</p><p>An unusual finding which is not typical of blistering disorders was the upregulation of the mucosal cytokeratins 4 and 13, a phenotype previously observed in keratinocytes with impaired SMAD 2, 4 and 7 signalling <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Buschke1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Jones <italic>et al.</italic> previously observed such changes in the TGF beta pathway in a VZV infected SCID-hu mouse model <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Jones2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Although we observe the same gene pattern changes as Buschke <italic>et al.</italic> in that we observed downregulation of KRT1/10/DSG1 and upregulation of KRT4/13, we did not find a significant enrichment of the TGF-beta pathway as a whole. It is possible that our transcriptome analysis, which was a single snapshot late on in VZV infection, failed to detect early signalling changes responsible for KRT4/13 changes. Alternatively, VZV may act via different pathways in this system.</p><p>Other observed changes in cytokeratin expression which do not usually form part of a blistering signature include the upregulation of KRT15 and KRT19 which are associated with stem cells in adnexal skin compartments, a region which histologically is positive for VZV early on in infection. KRT15 is also associated with wound healing, but other markers of keratinocyte activation in wound healing (e.g. KRT6, 16 and 17) <xref rid="ppat.1003896-Paladini1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> were unaltered in our transcriptome data.</p><p>In summary, we have shown by combined analysis of host and pathogen gene expression at a single time point that VZV gene expression is linked to keratinocyte differentiation. VZV replication, in turn, alters the structure of stratified squamous epithelium, driving a blistering, desquamative phenotype to form the typical skin vesicles, which are essential to VZV pathogenesis. The major functional groups studied in the manuscript i.e. the alterations affecting cytokeratins, desmosomes and proteases, are controlled by a number of regulatory pathways and further work is underway to untangle the complex molecular interactions between VZV and keratinocyte differentiation. While the data presented here are only a snapshot of this complex process, they provide a roadmap for further exploration of how VZV interacts with a target cell central to its pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Human skin from cosmetic reductive surgery was obtained with written informed consent under the approval of the East Central London Research Ethics Committee 1 (10/H0121/39).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Cells</title><p>Neonatal primary human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn, Life technologies, Paisley, UK) were cultured on mouse collagen IV (0.67 &#x000b5;g/cm<sup>2</sup> BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) coated surfaces in keratinocyte defined media containing epithelial growth factor (KDM and EpiLife, Life technologies).

A recombinant VZV expressing luciferase (VZV<sub>LUC</sub>) driven by ORF4 promoter was developed by cloning the ORF4 promoter upstream of the luciferase gene in the vector PGL3 (Promega Corp), followed by PCR amplification of the entire cassette and cloning into the pOka based cosmid pspe23 at the unique AvrII site located between OR65 and 66.

Hierarchical clustering was performed using Pearson's correlation coefficients on scale-normalised data. <bold>C</bold>) Principal component analysis of human reads for all samples. Projections are shown for components 1 and 2. Sample conditions are denoted by shape (KCV:triangles; KV:x's; KC: circles and K:+'s). Batches are denoted by colour (red: batch 1; green: batch 2; blue: batch 3). Considering the first 2 components, samples cluster primarily by batch, with the exception of the KC samples and KV2 and KV5 which all cluster tightly together regardless of batch. 1.2 mM calcium was added to primary keratinocytes and RNA harvested after 48 hrs. Ten genes were amplified by qPCR (<bold>D</bold>) in duplicate (all normalised to GAPDH) and the average fold difference and &#x000b1; stdev calculated. The qPCR data (bottom panel) was compared to the data obtained from the RNA-seq experiment (top panel). Analysis showed good correlation between the two methods, confirming the lack of bias in the library construction.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1003896.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1003896.s004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p>
