As many of the world&#x02019;s reefs are remote, there is limited information on how past thermal conditions have influenced reef composition and current stress responses. Using satellite temperature data for 1985&#x02013;2012, the analysis we present is the first to quantify, for global reef locations, spatial variations in warming trends, thermal stress events and temperature variability at reef-scale (~4&#x02009;km). Among over 60,000 reef pixels globally, 97% show positive SST trends during the study period with 60% warming significantly. Annual trends exceeded summertime trends at most locations. This indicates that the period of summer-like temperatures has become longer through the record, with a corresponding shortening of the &#x02018;winter&#x02019; reprieve from warm temperatures. The frequency of bleaching-level thermal stress increased three-fold between 1985&#x02013;91 and 2006&#x02013;12 &#x02013; a trend climate model projections suggest will continue. The thermal history data products developed enable needed studies relating thermal history to bleaching resistance and community composition. Such analyses can help identify reefs more resilient to thermal stress.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Record warm temperatures in recent years have been extremely stressful to coral reefs. At the time, 2014 set the record for the warmest global surface temperature. The year 2015 was 0.16&#x02009;&#x000b0;C warmer than 2014, setting not only the record for the warmest year ever but also the record for the largest single year increase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. So far, 2016 has been warmer than 2015 was. Ocean warming, exacerbated by one of the strongest El Ni&#x000f1;o events on record (comparable with 1997/98 and 1982/83) on top of a general warming trend, has resulted in the longest global coral bleaching event on record. Since mid-2014, reef stakeholders (scientists, managers) have reported observations of bleached corals near-continuously and from across all three tropical ocean basins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. As of late-2016 the event was ongoing, with more than 40% of global reef locations having been exposed to temperature stress levels that cause bleaching (G. Liu, pers. comm.).</p><p>Reefs are among the most sensitive of all ecosystems to climate change. Stony &#x02018;reef-building&#x02019; corals live in a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae (<italic>Symbiodinium spp.</italic>), whose photosynthesis provides corals with up to 90% of their energy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Environmental stressors can disrupt this relationship. The main driver of contemporary stress on coral reefs is high temperature, which together with high irradiance results in an accumulation of damage to photosystem II<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Under extreme stress the coral expels algae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, leaving its bright white aragonite skeleton visible through a thin translucent layer of coral tissue and appearing &#x02018;bleached&#x02019;. Anomalously warm sea temperatures across broad scales have been closely linked to spatially extensive &#x02018;mass&#x02019; coral bleaching events in recent decades<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>There is a bleaching continuum. Some coral paling is common in many coral species during warm-season months, and bleached corals can survive mild thermal stress and recover their algae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. However, severely bleached corals can and have died in great numbers when exposed to persistent stressful conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Thermally stressed corals have higher disease susceptibility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>; and reduced reproductive output<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and skeletal growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Eventual impacts of bleaching (over years to decades) can include reduced reef rugosity, coral cover and biodiversity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>; and perhaps local extinction of coral species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Reefs affected by bleaching provide a lower quality habitat for fish and invertebrate species, and provide fewer ecosystem goods and services for dependent human communities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. As ocean waters warm under climate change, bleaching events are expected to become both more frequent and more severe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>Historical temperature variation and the cumulative effects of past disturbance events influence not only the condition of reefs but also their capacity to respond to subsequent stress events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Corals are known to have adapted or acclimated to local environmental conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>; e.g., temperature thresholds for bleaching vary spatially and have been linked to local summertime conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Impacts from thermal stress have been lower at sites where short-term pulses of low-level temperature stress preceded higher thermal stress later in summer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> or that had been affected by a prior but recent thermal stress event (e.g., Thompson &#x00026; van Woesik<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, Heron <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Reef sites dominated by high-frequency variability (5.7-year period) over low-frequency variability (&#x0003e;54-year period) were observed to experience more intense thermal stress and severe bleaching<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. High SST variability year-round and during the warm season has also been suggested to proffer protection for reefs from bleaching<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Knowledge of thermal history can shape the lens through which managers and researchers view the current condition of reefs, and how they anticipate and respond to bleaching impacts on reefs. However, until now, high-resolution spatial data on key thermal history characteristics has not been available for all global coral reef locations.</p><p>Our objective here is to assess and provide tools to understand thermal history trends and patterns for reefs worldwide at the approximate scale of reefs using 4-km SST archives. Satellite remote sensing using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) provides the capacity to undertake analysis of sea surface temperature (SST)-based metrics over spatially vast areas at high-resolution (4&#x02009;km) through recent decades. Our period of analysis, 1985&#x02013;2012, spans the two previous global bleaching events confirmed to have impacted all three tropical ocean basins (i.e., global events) in 1998<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. We quantify and compare the following metrics for all coral reef areas: (1) rates of change in annual and warm-season SST; (2) the frequency of exposure to and onset timing of bleaching-level thermal stress events; (3) the percentage of reefs exposed to bleaching-level thermal stress each year during the study period; and (4) warm-season temperature variability.

The context of future thermal exposure is included using stress projections based on the latest available global modelling.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>In summary, our analysis of thermal history at global coral reef locations revealed warming at almost all reefs in recent decades; summertime temperature increased through the record at the great majority of reefs. One-third of the world&#x02019;s reefs were exposed to bleaching-level thermal stress less than once per decade, with one-third of reefs exposed between once and twice per decade, and the remaining one-third exposed more than twice per decade. The global percentage of reefs impacted by bleaching stress tripled through the 28-year record, explaining the increase in observed bleaching. While the onset of thermal stress mostly coincided with the warmest part of the year, we found that at nearly one-quarter of reefs it did not. The following key points were identified from each set of thermal history parameters.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>SST Trends</title><p>Coral reef SST warmed during the 28-year period, with cool seasons warming faster than warm seasons. Annual average temperature increased during the study period at nearly all 4-km reef pixels (97% or 58,847 pixels).

The distribution of values is demonstrated by annual average temperature time-series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) for five reef locations for the approximately 99<sup>th</sup>, 75<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup> and 1<sup>st</sup> percentiles for SST trend. Annual-average SST trend was positive and significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) at 60% of reefs (36,308 pixels), while negative and significant at less than 0.01% of reefs (4 pixels). Locations with cooling temperatures are all in the Atlantic region north of Grand Bahama Island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>), which is in contrast to the general warming across the Atlantic region (0.17&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.12&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/decade).</p><p>Bleaching stress typically occurs during the warm season. Reef SSTs warmed more slowly during the warm season (avg: 0.16&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/decade) and had greater spatial variability (SD: 0.14&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/decade) than the overall SST trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1b</xref>).

In contrast, significantly negative trends occurred at only &#x0003c;0.03% of reefs (16 pixels). All regional-average warm-season trends were positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).

Bleaching stress on reefs occurred most frequently in the Middle East (9.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.6) and least often in the Australia region (3.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.8). Globally, 33% of reefs (19,794 pixels) experienced bleaching-level stress two or fewer times during the record (&#x0003c;1/decade). The Australia, Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia regions had the highest proportions of infrequent exposure (&#x0003c;1/decade at 43%, 41% and 38% of reefs, respectively). One-third (33%, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;19,831) of reefs globally experienced bleaching-level thermal stress events six or more times during the 28-year record (&#x0003e;2/decade), with most reefs in the Middle East and Atlantic affected (81% and 59%, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).

The greatest numbers of reefs were impacted in 1998 (48%), 2010 (48%) and 2005 (32%), corresponding to the two global bleaching events and largest Caribbean bleaching event during this period. In most regions, 1998 and 2010 were the two highest ranked (either 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup>) years for all reef regions with the exception of the Atlantic (2005, 2010) and Pacific (2009, 2000). When the record was divided into four 7-year periods, the global percentage of reef pixels that were stressed increased steadily (8, 14, 23 and 26%), tripling from 1985&#x02013;91 to 2006&#x02013;12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>&#x02013;right, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S7b</xref>). This increasing trend of bleaching-level stress events was consistent in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Pacific and Atlantic regions. In contrast, there was no consistent temporal trend in the frequency of bleaching events in Indian Ocean and Australia reef pixels; the number of reef pixels affected in first or second 7-year period is comparable with that of the most recent period (within 1%).</p><p>The percentage of reef locations exposed to bleaching-level thermal stress events is projected by climate models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> to continue to increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>&#x02013;right, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S7b</xref>).

The onset of bleaching stress did not coincide with or immediately precede the warmest month in nearly one quarter of reef locations. While some of these reefs were found in each of the six regions, most were in the Southeast Asia and Pacific regions. This may reflect timing delays due to the Southeast Asian monsoon cycle and the relatively high interannual variability in the equatorial Pacific (linked to El Ni&#x000f1;o-Southern Oscillation events), respectively.

Using our analysis we identify reefs potentially more resilient to climate change impacts to inform conservation efforts.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>SST Trends</title><p>Warming of coral reef waters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S1</xref>) was distinctly higher than that reported for ocean waters in general, both globally (0.10&#x02013;0.12&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/decade, 1971&#x02013;2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) and regionally (0.02&#x02013;0.13&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/decade, 1950&#x02013;2009<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).

Previous global mapping of SST variability at reduced resolution (0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x000b0;) indicated strong influence of latitudinal variation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.

As the level of variability that confers bleaching resistance is unknown, we identified locations where the variability scaled by the local climatological range was in the approximately upper quartile of global values.</p><p>Spatial analysis of the aforementioned metrics was undertaken for reef locations globally (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;60,710). To provide further insight into regional (ocean basin/sub-basin) patterns of the metrics while aligning with existing conservation management knowledge, spatial analyses were also undertaken for the six regions defined by the World Resources Institute&#x02019;s Reefs at Risk&#x02013;Revisited analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. These reef regions are as follows: Middle East (MID), Indian Ocean (IND), Southeast Asia (SEA), Australia (AUS), Pacific Ocean (PAC) and Atlantic Ocean (ATL).

G Liu, J De La Cour and E Geiger co-developed the NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) webpages that contain static and interactive maps of the thermal history metrics presented here. The NOAA CRCP and National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) support the NOAA CRW team. Figures were collaboratively developed with D Tracey. The Total Foundation (<italic>Fondation Total</italic>) is providing financial support to ongoing analyses using thermal history data layers to identify reefs potentially more resilient to climate change.
