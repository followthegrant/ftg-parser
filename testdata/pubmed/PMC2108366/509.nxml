<italic>Tradescantia</italic> pollen grains, isolated during the period of DNA synthesis in the generative cell, accumulate deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP)-<sup>3</sup>H after incubation with thymidine-<sup>3</sup>H in the presence of millimolar deoxyadenosine. Most of this dTTP-<sup>3</sup>H was found to resist extraction by the fixative, cold ethanol-acetic acid, and its location was investigated by radioautography with thin, dry emulsion. Substantial binding of dTTP-<sup>3</sup>H occurred as an artifact; but when nuclei were isolated from the fixed pollen grains by sonication, it was found that they were differentially labeled: generative nuclei contained dTTP-<sup>3</sup>H, vegetative nuclei did not. This observation is discussed and is interpreted as evidence supporting the idea that thymidine is phosphorylated only in the generative cell of the pollen grain. </p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
