The editorial board meetings were organized in a traditional style and peer review was performed in a friendly manner. Nevertheless, it was one of the most distinguished medical periodicals in Romania.</p><p><bold>Clujul Medical</bold> was intended as the journal of the school of medicine and pharmacy from Cluj-Napoca, thus of the Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca. This feature allows us to analyze for publication papers from all medical specialties: basic sciences, clinical medicine, dental medicine, pharmacy, history of medicine. Few other journals have such a diverse and polychromatic profile. At the beginning the journal was the mirror of the scientific potential of our university but nowadays it has kept the diversity, improving the quality of the papers and becoming an international journal.</p><p>The progress in the technology of the processing of information, the need to increase the visibility of the scientific work and the communication between scientists determined us to make some steps forward. Thus, ten years ago our journal moved to a new home, the web page. Since then, all the papers are only in English and no abstract in Romanian is published. We enlarged the editorial board with top scientists from this country but also with colleagues from different other countries. The peer reviewing is done anonymously online like in any modern publication. The time elapsed to get a decision to publish or not is on average 3 to 6 months. The rejection rate is 32%. There is no publication fee for local invited contributors, the others pay a more than symbolic publication fee. Moreover, thanks to the support of our university, we are an open access journal.</p><p>Soon the journal was indexed in international data bases. We also received an increasing number of citations. More investigators from abroad started to submit papers to our journal. We are confident that our journal <bold>Clujul Medical</bold> is on an ascending pathway.</p><fig id="f1-cm-91-5" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="cm-91-5f1"/></fig><p>From time to time any journal has to be refreshed and continued by others, having a more or less different insight. Therefore I decided to pass the honorable task of editor in chief to Professor Radu Badea, a very distinguished and prolific scientist. I am confident that he will obtain great success with the journal and that it will progress in quality of the content and in visibility. I acknowledge very much the collaboration with our team from the editorial office, editorial board and technical team.</p><p>Thank you for having read or contributed to the journal in the last ten years and I am sure that you will continue to support this journal. May I also wish success to the new editorial staff.</p><fig id="f2-cm-91-5" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="cm-91-5f2"/></fig></body></article>
