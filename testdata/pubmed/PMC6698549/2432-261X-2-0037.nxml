The purpose of this study is to demonstrate clinical features and thoracic factors, such as sternal tilt angle and Haller index, in patients that have idiopathic or syndromic scoliosis associated with pectus excavatum.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient Selection and Clinical Investigation</title><p>From April 1985 to February 2014, 113 patients with both scoliosis and pectus excavatum were admitted to our hospital. We excluded adult scoliosis (age more than 20 years), congenital scoliosis, neuromuscular scoliosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, scoliosis of less than 10 degrees, and patients with incomplete clinical data or images. A total of 70 patients (37 male and 33 female) that had idiopathic or syndromic scoliosis associated with pectus excavatum were evaluated. We investigated age, location and Cobb angle of the main curve, thoracic factors including the deviation and tilting angle of the sternum, and the Haller index using radiographs and computed tomography of the chest. We also evaluated whether patients received surgical correction of their pectus excavatum.</p></sec><sec><title>Radiologic Evaluation</title><p>CT scans were used to determine sternal deviation (left, center, right), sternal tilt (left or right inclination and angle), and Haller index. We evaluated sternal deviation and tilt in 53 patients, but we were only able to estimate sternal tilt angle and Haller index in 29 patients because some cases did not have an image of the entire chest wall and others did not have CT images taken prior to corrective surgery for the pectus excavatum. We defined sternal tilt as the angle generated by the sternum and the axis of the body at the most collapsed plane of the sternum in axial CT scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Position of the sternum was defined as right, center, or left based on the position of the center of the sternum relative to the vertebral body on axial CT scan.</p><fig id="g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Sternal tilt angle.

In normal individuals, the average Haller index is 2.5, whereas with a significant pectus deformity&#x03000;it is 3.25 or greater<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. In patients with scoliosis and pectus excavatum, since the sternum tends to be deviated unilaterally, we modified the method for calculating the Haller index (Modified Haller index; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Two senior spine surgeons (R.T., Y.S.) measured each parameter twice, and the average score was used for analysis. The intraobserver correlation coefficients were 0.909 (95% confidence interval, 0.830-0.952) and 0.991 (95% confidence interval, 0.983-0.996), and the interobserver coefficient was 0.965 (95% confidence interval, 0.934-0.982).</p><fig id="g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Modified Haller index.

Most of these patients had a left side deviated sternum and a higher Haller index score. Although the Cobb angle and thoracic parameters did not significantly correlate with each other, with regard to the severity of the pectus excavatum, a significant difference was found between sternal tilt angle and Haller index. Regardless of whether pectus excavatum surgery was performed before scoliosis treatment, none of our patients experienced severe hypotension or cardiopulmonary dysfunction during their scoliosis correction surgery or cast or brace treatment.</p><p>Several studies have reported the incidence of scoliosis in association with pectus excavatum. In 1989, Waters P et al. evaluated the incidence of scoliosis in 461 patients with pectus excavatum. They found that 99 of their study's patients (21.5%) had scoliosis with an average Cobb angle of 15 degrees (range 6-78 degrees)<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. Hong JY et al. examined 248 patients diagnosed with pectus excavatum for the incidence of scoliosis, and the prevalence of idiopathic scoliosis was 22.58%. Furthermore, the incidence of scoliosis was significantly higher in female patients, and the Lenke type 1 predominated in pectus patients (48.2%)<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, Wang Y et al. reported that 25 out of 142 patients (17.6%) with pectus excavatum had scoliosis with a Cobb angle &#x0003e; 10 degrees, and in 80% of the cases the spinal column was bent to the right. They found that adolescents had a higher incidence than pediatric patients, and those with a Cobb angle greater than 10 degrees were mainly within the severe scoliosis group and had Haller indices &#x02265; 3.5<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, several authors reported severe complications associated with the prone position during surgery in children with scoliosis and pectus excavatum. Alexianu D et al. reported the case of a child with neurofibromatosis, pectus excavatum, and rapidly progressive scoliosis who developed severe hypotension after placement in the prone position during elective posterior spinal fusion. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed compression of the right ventricle by the sternum due to the compression of the transverse bolsters. After repositioning the longitudinal bolsters, the patient remained hemodynamically stable with no compression of the right ventricle evident on the TEE, and the posterior fusion proceeded uneventfully<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. Bafus BT et al. also reported a case of severe hypotension in a child with pectus excavatum who seemed marfanoid undergoing posterior spinal fusion for scoliosis after the patient was placed in the prone position. They accomplished the posterior spinal fusion for scoliosis after performing a modified Ravitch procedure to repair the pectus excavatum<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, Galas JM et al. also presented a case with pectus excavatum and thoracolumbar scoliosis that developed severe hypotension after placement in the prone position for spinal fusion. A TEE showed the sternum compressing the right heart. After Nuss bar placement to correct the pectus excavatum, the patient underwent posterior spinal fusion uneventfully<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Malek MH et al. performed a meta-analysis on cardiovascular function following surgical repair of pectus excavatum, and they demonstrated that surgical repair of the pectus excavatum significantly improves cardiovascular function<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There were several limitations in our study. First, this was a retrospective study with a small sample size. We could not collect appropriate numbers of patients with each type of scoliosis. Second, we could not evaluate thoracic parameters in all the cases because some CT scans did not reveal the entire chest wall in the image. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report thoracic factors in patients with both scoliosis and pectus excavatum which included idiopathic or syndromic type and varying degrees of scoliosis from moderate to severe which required treatment such as surgery or cast/brace. Finally, we suggest that the orthopedic surgeons fully assess the thoracic factors in patients with scoliosis and pectus excavatum prior to performing scoliosis surgery or cast/brace treatment and carefully monitor their patient's general condition during scoliosis treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We evaluated 70 idiopathic or syndromic scoliosis patients who also had pectus excavatum. In most cases, the sternum was located on the left side, and their Haller index scores were higher than the normal population. Prone positioning, the corrective force applied during scoliosis surgery, and the thoracic cage compression that occurs during cast or brace treatment might negatively affect cardiac function in patients with both scoliosis and pectus excavatum.</p></sec><sec><title/><p content-type="COI-statement">Conflicts of Interest: The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We sincerely express our appreciation to Ms. S Hiraiwa and Michael Anton Castro for their contribution to this project.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Prats MR, Gonzalez LR, Venturelli MF, et al.
