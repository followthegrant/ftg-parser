The duration of treatment for this complication must occasionally extend beyond discharge from the hospital. In this study, we evaluated the commonly used anti-emetic promethazine for its efficacy in the post-discharge period. Adult outpatient surgical patients who had excessive postoperative nausea and vomiting in the recovery room, or who were at risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting following discharge were given two promethazine suppositories (25 mg) for home use. All patients were contacted by our recovery room nurses on the first business day after their surgery and questioned as to their use of the suppositories and, if used, their efficacy. We found that 55 percent of patients given promethazine suppositories for home use had nausea and vomiting in the post-discharge period. Of the patients given promethazine, 89 percent used the suppositories. All of these patients reported improvement in their symptoms following use of the suppositories. None reported adverse effects from the promethazine suppositories. In conclusion, we found promethazine suppositories to be an inexpensive and efficacious treatment for nausea and vomiting in adult outpatient surgical patients following discharge from the hospital. Side-effects were minimal, and our patients voiced no complaints about this mode of therapy. We recommend this therapy for treatment of nausea and vomiting after hospital discharge following adult outpatient surgery.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="391" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="392" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="393" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="394" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="yjbm00024-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="395" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
