However, we have recently shown that overexpression of the transcriptional activator Hap4p in yeast causes cells to move to a state characterized by increased respiratory activity.

Overexpression of <italic>HAP4</italic>, however, primarily acts on mitochondrial function and biogenesis. In fact, a number of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are induced to a greater extent than in cells that have passed through a normal diauxic shift: in addition to genes required for mitochondrial energy conservation they include genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We show that overproduction of a single nuclear transcription factor enables cells to move to a novel state that displays features typical of, but clearly not identical to, other derepressed states.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Unraveling and understanding the complex regulatory networks in a cell is an important step in genomic research, since it should enable us to understand how the cell modifies its behavior in response to both internal and external signals.</p><p>A diauxic shift occurs when yeast cells have consumed all glucose fermentatively and convert their metabolism to oxidative catabolism of the ethanol remaining in the medium. This shift has been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and is a good example of how cells move from one 'equilibrium' state, for example, fermentative physiology, to another 'equilibrium' state, for example, respiratory physiology. The transition from fermentative physiology to respiratory physiology, in the wild or in the laboratory, involves many changes in gene expression that contribute to the final phenotype. The <italic>HAP4 </italic>overexpression system on the other hand is relatively simple: one factor that is known to be required for induction of respiratory activity can indeed induce a physiological change that resembles that of the diauxic shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Metabolic and regulatory gene networks have generally evolved to allow physiological and developmental processes to compensate for the effects of potentially deleterious mutations, termed robustness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Important questions are how equilibrium states are maintained and how the transition between states is implemented by the cell. Depending on where a particular regulatory protein is located in the hierarchical global regulatory network of the cell, the response to a change in its activity may be either localized or pleiotropic. To identify the various components of the pleiotropic response to <italic>HAP4 </italic>overexpression, that is, to 'fingerprint' the changes in the regulatory network, we use two different methods. First, we use the algorithm REDUCE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] to infer the regulatory activity of transcription factors from the mRNA expression of their target genes. Second, we use a new and related algorithm, named Quontology, to identify classes of genes with similar function that are significant induced or repressed. Both methods have the property that they can detect small-amplitude but coordinated changes in the average expression level of a set of genes, even if the expression of individual genes is not changing significantly.</p><p>In this paper we report detailed analysis of the changes that occur as a result of overexpression of <italic>HAP4</italic>. Using a number of techniques it could be shown that overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>enhances transcription of a large set of mitochondrial protein genes, leading to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and enabling cells to move to a distinct and novel state.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cells overexpressing <italic>HAP4 </italic>upregulate mitochondrial biogenesis and activity even in the presence of glucose</title><p>To determine the effect of overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>on mitochondria, several different experimental approaches were used to quantify mitochondrial components and mitochondrial structures in the cell.</p><p>First, the quantity and quality of the respiratory-chain complexes were analyzed by subjecting mitochondrial extracts to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, in the glucose-grown wild-type strain (WT YPD in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) most of the various respiratory chain or OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation) complexes are undetectable or barely detected as a result of the glucose-mediated repression of respiratory function. Only complex V (the ATP synthase) can be clearly distinguished, in particular an intense spot that consists of the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits of the F1 subcomplex. Glucose-grown cells that overexpress <italic>HAP4</italic>, on the other hand, show very distinct OXPHOS complexes (see <italic>HAP4 </italic>YPD in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The pattern of spots of the glucose-grown <italic>HAP4 </italic>overproducer is similar to wild-type cells that grow in fully respiratory mode on a non-fermentable carbon source (compare <italic>HAP4 </italic>YPD and WT YPEG in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The increased abundance of OXPHOS complexes in the glucose-grown <italic>HAP4 </italic>overproducer is further shown by the fact that mitochondrial suspensions from the <italic>HAP4 </italic>overexpression strain contain approximately twofold more protein per gram wet weight compared to its wild-type counterpart (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>).</p><p>The cellular content of cytochromes <italic>c </italic>+ <italic>c</italic><sub>1 </sub>and <italic>b </italic>is also markedly increased, 50% and 65% respectively, when the <italic>HAP4 </italic>gene is overexpressed in glucose-grown cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). The cytochrome <italic>aa</italic><sub>3 </sub>content is also increased in the <italic>HAP4 </italic>strain, although the corresponding part of the difference spectra does not allow proper quantification.</p><p>The mitochondrial content of cells was further analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using the fluorescent dye DASPMI, which specifically stains mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. To compare mitochondrial DASPMI fluorescence between strains directly, glucose-grown wild-type and <italic>HAP4</italic>-overexpressing cells were mixed. Wild-type and <italic>HAP4 </italic>cells were identified <italic>in situ </italic>by also staining one of the strains with the cell-wall dye CalcoFluorWhite (CFW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]) before mixing the cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <italic>HAP4</italic>-overexpressing cells contain more mitochondrial structures per cell (<italic>HAP4 </italic>cells are identified by CFW fluorescence in the left panels and by the absence of CFW fluorescence in the right panels). This is consistent with the fact that more membranous vesicles are present in mitochondrial suspensions extracted from <italic>HAP4</italic>-overexpressing cells (data not shown). Interestingly, <italic>HAP4</italic>-overexpressing cells also exhibit increased DASPMI fluorescence. Although this may suggest an increased membrane potential over the mitochondrial inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], we favor the idea that the inner membrane has a more compact structure in these mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Nuclear DNA encodes the majority of mitochondrial proteins. Several mitochondrial components, such as a number of subunits of enzymes of the respiratory chain, are encoded by the mitochondrial genome. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows that overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>in glucose-growth conditions not only results in increased transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein genes ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and see below) but also leads to enhanced transcription of all mitochondrial genes tested. In particular, <italic>COX2 </italic>mRNA was induced to high levels. It should be noted that the increase in transcription in the mitochondrion is not accompanied by strong alterations in the copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (data not shown), indicating that the increase in mitochondrial transcription is mainly due to increased activity of the mitochondrial transcription machinery.</p><p>The strong increase in OXPHOS complex abundance and in mitochondrial protein and cytochrome content per cell, together with the evidence that shows that <italic>HAP4 </italic>cells contain more mitochondrial structures per cell, conclusively shows that overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>in glucose-growth conditions results in increased mitochondrial biogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Fingerprinting the regulatory network of <italic>HAP4 </italic>overexpressing cells</title><p>Genome-wide expression was monitored with Affymetrix GeneChips using RNA from wild-type and <italic>HAP4 </italic>cells grown aerobically on minimal glucose medium (YNB) in a batch fermenter. For each strain, two separate hybridizations were carried out and the log<sub>2</sub>-expression ratios or fold-changes were calculated for <italic>HAP4 </italic>overexpression versus wild type.</p><p>Because the <italic>HAP4</italic>-overexpression system can induce a physiological change that resembles that of the diauxic shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], we first analyzed whether the state of the regulatory activity network in the <italic>HAP4 </italic>overexpressor is similar to one or more of the transient states of the diauxic shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For this, the regulatory activity network was fingerprinted using the Quontology algorithm (see Materials and methods). This algorithm enables the identification of functional groups of genes that have changed in expression as a result of increased expression of <italic>HAP4</italic>. A Z-score is calculated for the functional categories from the MIPS database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], which is a measure of the changes that occur in the regulatory activity network. Categories with a Z-score larger than 4 can be considered to be induced or repressed significantly. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows all functional categories that were induced or repressed significantly in the <italic>HAP4</italic>-overexpressing strain or in one of the expression profiles from the diauxic shift.</p><p>From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> it is evident that overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>results in alterations in the regulatory network that resembles the time points of the diauxic shift with respect to several important functional categories (see categories marked with a filled circle).</p><p>The alterations in the regulatory activity network of the diauxic shift mainly occur in three phases, as indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>: high glucose concentrations; strongly decreasing glucose concentration; and glucose depletion where cells grow in respiratory mode on the remaining ethanol. The <italic>HAP4 </italic>overexpression profile is similar in a number of respects to the profiles of cells growing in decreasing glucose concentrations (13.5 and 15.5 hours; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, in this case also, the changes that occur in the diauxic shift are much more extensive, in particular with respect to the categories 'metabolism of energy reserves' and 'rRNA transcription'. Hence, the regulatory activity network of the <italic>HAP4</italic>-overexpressing strain has moved to a state that resembles one of the transition states of the diauxic shift, but at the same time differs in a number of important aspects.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Hap4p </italic>is a global regulator that coordinately and specifically upregulates mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biogenesis</title><p>All functional categories that are significantly increased (Z-score &#x0003e; 4) in the <italic>HAP4</italic>-overexpressing strain are related to mitochondrial function (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), including the main category 'protein synthesis' which consists largely of mitochondrial protein genes. Consistently, the vast majority of the 139 nuclear genes that are induced more than twofold in the <italic>HAP4</italic>-overexpressing strain (see genes listed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and Materials and methods) encode proteins that localize to mitochondria. It is striking that if the expression of these genes is compared to the expression in respiratory-state cells (columns 2-8 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) or in glucose-repressed cells (column 9), it can be observed in the right part of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> that there are a large number of genes that are strongly upregulated in the <italic>HAP4 </italic>overproducer but not upregulated in respiring cells. As these genes also encode mitochondrial proteins, this suggests that overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>leads to a novel state in which the expression of mitochondrial proteins goes beyond levels that are required in normal physiological conditions.</p><p>The two clusters of genes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> fall into different functional categories. The group of genes that is responsive to changes in the respiro-fermentative growth mode consists mainly of genes encoding proteins that are directly involved in respiration (see genes listed in the left part of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The second, larger and non-responsive group mainly consists of genes that encode proteins involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis (see genes listed in the right part of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Apparently, overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>not only results in increased expression of genes encoding proteins required for mitochondrial energy conservation (or generation) but also of genes that are required for the synthesis of functional mitochondria.</p><p>The upstream activation sequences (UAS) of the genes of the non-responsive group - but not those of the responsive group - generally all lack the typical Hap2/3/4/5p-binding element CCAATCA. This is interesting, as this particular element strongly correlates with the changes in expression that occur as a result of overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], REDUCE: <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-6</sup>). Furthermore, with a more in-depth computational search for potential Hap2/3/4/5p sites using a nucleotide-distribution matrix, no difference could be observed between promoters of the non-responsive group and random-sequence DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>). In contrast, in the gene promoters of the responsive gene cluster a large number of potential Hap2/3/4/5p sites can be detected that are distributed over the promoter according to a typical yeast UAS (100-400 bp upstream of the translational start codon ATG). These data strongly suggest that the Hap2/3/4/5p complex does not directly regulate the vast majority of genes of the non-responsive gene cluster, namely genes important for mitochondrial proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>negatively affects transcription of a small set of genes involved in zinc metabolism</title><p>In addition to the above-mentioned genes, which are upregulated and lead to increased mitochondrial biogenesis, it should be noted that the expression of 23 genes is reduced by overexpression of <italic>HAP4</italic>. These genes are <italic>RPR1 </italic>(-2.3), EUG1 (-2.3), <bold><italic>ZRT1 </italic></bold>(-17.0), <bold><italic>ADH4 </italic></bold>(-7.9), <bold><italic>YGL258W </italic></bold>(-3.9), YHR048W (-2.5), HXT4 (-2.7), <italic>TDH1 </italic>(-3.0), <bold><italic>ZAP1 </italic></bold>(-6.8), CWP1 (-3.0), <bold><italic>ZRT3 </italic></bold>(-3.4), <bold><italic>ZRT2 </italic></bold>(-2.9), <italic>TFS1 </italic>(-2.4), <italic>THI7 </italic>(-2.9), CAR2 (-2.7), SNO1 (-3.8), SNZ1 (-2.9), <bold><italic>FET4 </italic></bold>(-2.7), <bold><italic>YNL254C </italic></bold>(-5.3), FRE4 (-3.0), <italic>COS10 </italic>(-2.4), <bold><italic>YOL154W </italic></bold>(-27.3), <bold><italic>YOR387C </italic></bold>(-18.4). Interestingly, a large number of these genes are involved in zinc metabolism. Genes indicated in bold are most strongly affected by overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>(&#x0003c;-3) and have been proposed to be targeted by zinc-specific transcription factor Zap1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In fact, the expression of <italic>ZAP1 </italic>itself is strongly repressed by overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>and, furthermore, the repressive motif ACC-5-GGT, the DNA-binding site of Zap1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], was identified by the REDUCE algorithm with high significance, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-12</sup>. Hence, we conclude that the main repressive effect of overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>is mediated through decreased expression of the Zap1p transcription factor. Genes that are typically not altered in expression on zinc depletion or <italic>zap1</italic>-deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] are given in non-italic type above, and are suggested to be repressed through a different mechanism, possibly through the same mechanism that initially represses the <italic>ZAP1 </italic>gene.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report we show that overexpression of the gene encoding the activation moiety of the Hap2/3/4/5p transcription complex causes glucose-grown cells to move to a novel state that is characterized by a shift to higher respiratory activity. <italic>HAP4</italic>-overexpressing cells contain more mitochondrial structures, increased amounts of mitochondrial proteins/cytochromes and enhanced transcription of the mitochondrial genome. This suggests that overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>results in a general increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. Consistently, whole-genome expression profiling and subsequent computational analyses do indeed show that overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>specifically alters transcription of a very large set of mitochondrial protein genes. <italic>HAP4</italic>-overexpressing cells resemble cells that undergo a physiological diauxic shift, but at the same time differ from these cells in a number of important respects. First, in the <italic>HAP4 </italic>overexpressor no increase occurs in the functional category 'metabolism of energy reserves' and in functional categories that are involved in transcription, mainly 'rRNA transcription'. Second, genes involved in zinc metabolism are downregulated, and third, genes involved in protein synthesis in mitochondria are strongly upregulated.</p><p>With respect to the latter it should be noted that the effects we show in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> might to some extent be affected by differences in the set-up of the experiments, that is, differences in the genetic background of the strains and/or of the array platforms used. However, other previously published expression profiles show induction of this non-responsive group of genes, which contains mainly mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes (MRP genes). These studies looked at the effects of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], addition of rapamycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], a 'pulse'-like induction at the diauxic shift (see lanes 2 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), and at the diauxic shift that precedes the stationary phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, if the Z-scores are calculated for the genes of the non-responsive and the responsive group using the expression profiles of 300 null mutants from Hughes <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we find that the expression of the non-responsive group alters more strongly in mutants that have a decreased growth rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref>). As the growth rate of the <italic>HAP4 </italic>overproducer is not affected, we suggest that the transcriptional response of MRP genes is not only dependent on the growth rate itself, but also on whether cells respire more and/or ferment less.</p><p>The fact that genes involved in zinc metabolism are primarily downregulated by overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>is surprising. Complex (auto)regulation of the zinc regulator Zap1p and the central role of mitochondria in metal metabolism are likely to be important in this downregulation. However, as zinc is an essential component of more than 300 enzymes - including, paradoxically, cytochrome oxidase - particular zinc-dependent factors may be involved. Candidate factors that require zinc are: the mitochondrial metalloproteases Afg3p, Rca1p and Yem1p; the transcription factors Cat8, Mig1p, Mig2p, Mal63 and Hap1p; and alcohol dehydrogenases.</p><p>We have shown here that increased expression of a single transcription factor enables the alteration of a particular branch of the yeast regulatory activity network, leading to remarkably specific alterations in expression of specific functional sets of genes and revealing only minor cross-talk with other parts of the regulatory activity network. Hence, the regulatory activity network that determines mitochondrial function appears to be highly modular. This is an important notion, as the regulatory activity network may consist of similar more-or-less isolated modules, which may enable the construction of a simple but realistic computational model of the <italic>in silico </italic>cell.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>The wild-type strain CEN.PK113-7D and its <italic>HAP4</italic>-overproducing counterpart 436 GH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], in which the <italic>HAP4 </italic>gene is overexpressed more than fivefold in glucose-growth conditions, were used.

This shows that the latter strain grows in a more respiratory mode, similar to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which is accompanied by a decrease in the glucose consumption and ethanol production rates: from q<sub>glucose </sub>= 15.6 mmol/g/h and q<sub>ethanol </sub>= 19.8 mmol/g/h for the wild-type strain, to q<sub>glucose </sub>= 11.1 mmol/g/h and q<sub>ethanol </sub>= 15.6 mmol/g/h for the <italic>HAP4</italic>-overexpressing strain. The cultures were grown until OD<sub>600 </sub>= 1.0 (approximately 8 h), cells were chilled rapidly by addition of ice, centrifuged and stored at -70&#x000b0;C. RNA was extracted using hot phenol according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>mRNA was isolated using Oligotex (Qiagen). Labeling and hybridization of GeneChip Yeast Genome S98 Arrays were carried out according to Affymetrix.</p></sec><sec><title>Computational analysis</title><p>The average ratio was calculated from log<sub>2 </sub>expression ratios that derive from two independent experiments of the <italic>HAP4 </italic>overexpressor relative to two independent wild-type experiments. ORFs for which the expression ratios diverged twofold in duplicate experiments were excluded from the analysis. Using interpolated variance analysis, 110 genes were calculated to be regulated significantly (<italic>p </italic>&#x02264; 0.01; data not shown). In this analysis genes are selected that show a twofold change, k-means clustering was carried out using Cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], corrected for a minor bug that inappropriately displays the gene of the second cluster as the final gene of the first cluster. Matrix searches were carried out using the Hap2/3/4/5/p nucleotide-distribution matrix from the TransFac database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and the MatInspector program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Matches to the Hap2/3/4/5/p matrix were analyzed in random-sequence DNA (A/T 31%, C/G 19% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]) that contained the same number of promoters of the non-responsive gene cluster.</p></sec><sec><title>Quontology algorithm</title><p>Several publications have used genome-wide expression patterns to score functional gene categories, by considering the overlap between each category and the set of genes induced or repressed above a certain threshold. We take a very different approach that is essentially identical to the REDUCE algorithm for scoring promoter elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] but with manually defined gene categories from an ontology replacing the set of genes whose promoter contains a particular DNA motif. Again, a Z-score can be calculated for each category that measures the deviation of the average log-ratio for genes in the category from the genome-wide average, in units of the standard deviation. A similar method has recently been discussed by Pavlidis <italic>et al</italic>.

Mitochondrial proteins from ethanol-grown, respiring wild-type cells are shown as control (WT YPEG, rich medium containing non-fermentable carbon sources: 2% ethanol and 2% glycerol). Respiratory-chain complexes V, III, IV and II from mitochondria isolated from 40 mg (wet weight) wild-type or <italic>HAP4 </italic>cells were separated in the first dimension (from left to right) by blue native, 5-13% gradient gel electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

The whole-genome expression data of the diauxic shift are divided into three datasets that represent: glucose excess; a strongly decreasing glucose concentration; and glucose depletion. Using the quontology algorithm, Z-scores were calculated for the functional categories defined by MIPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Generally, all categories that have at least one Z-score larger than 4 or smaller than -4 are listed (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.1). The hierarchy of the categories is preserved: the main categories in capitals, the subcategories indented and in lower case. A filled circle marks MIPS categories that show the same pattern of expression in more respiratory conditions (the five columns on the right). Interestingly, overexpression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>results in specific induction of MIPS categories that are involved in mitochondrial function, causing the regulatory activity network to move to a state that is different from the diauxic shift.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2002-4-1-r3-5"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Genes that show more than twofold induction in the <italic>HAP4 </italic>overexpression dataset can be divided in two distinct groups using k-means clustering analysis (Cluster software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]).

The distribution of Hap2/3/4/5p sites in the promoters of genes from the responsive gene cluster localize between -400 and -100 bp from the ATG, a common distance for yeast UAS. Putative Hap2/3/4/5p sites extracted from the non-responsive gene cluster show a random distribution similar to that found for random-sequence DNA (A/T 31%, C/G 19%), and are therefore likely to be non-functional matches to the matrix. <bold>(b) </bold>The correlation between Z-scores and growth rate of the constitutive (left) and regulated (right) clusters calculated with the Quontology algorithm (see also Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) using experimental data from a large number of deletion mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].
