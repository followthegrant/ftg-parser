Here, we investigated the role of the mTOR pathway in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival in a mouse model of rapidly progressive lethal sepsis induced by severe invasive candidiasis and explored the possible mechanism. The decrease in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival following fungal sepsis was ameliorated in mice with a T-cell-specific mTOR deletion, whereas it was exacerbated in mice with a T-cell-specific tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 deletion. To explore the mechanism further, we measured expression of autophagy proteins light chain 3B and p62/sequestosome 1 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Both proteins were increased in T-cell-specific mTOR knockout mice but lower in T-cell-specific TSC1 knockout mice. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that T-cell-specific mTOR knockout mice had more autophagosomes than wild-type mice following fungal sepsis. CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell mTOR knockout decreased CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell apoptosis in fungal sepsis. Most notably, the T-cell-specific mTOR deletion mice had an increased survival rate after fungal sepsis. These results suggest that the mTOR pathway plays a vital role in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival during fungal sepsis, partly through the autophagy&#x02013;apoptosis pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Lethal fungal sepsis</kwd><kwd>severe invasive candidiasis</kwd><kwd>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</kwd><kwd>mammalian target of rapamycin</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>81601657</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81601657) and Wu Jieping Medical Foundation (No. 320.6750.18419).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><ref-count count="38"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Candidemia is the most common invasive fungal disease worldwide [<xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. Due mainly to the significant progress in transplantation procedures, the rapid development of cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy and the broader use of corticosteroids, about 400,000 people globally develop candidemia every year, and the mortality approaches 40% [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. To make matters worse, septic shock caused by <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is fatal, with a mortality rate approaching 90%, which is three times that of septic shock induced by bacteria [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. The main reason is that most of the patients with candidemia are immunocompromised or in critical condition. Once septic shock occurs, it progresses rapidly, combined with severe multiple organ failure, and causes rapid death in more than half the patients within 7&#x000a0;days [<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. Accordingly, in recent years, some studies have attempted to improve the prognosis through immunomodulation combined with antifungal medication [<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>].</p><p>The host immune response to fungal infection occurs in a coordinated way via both the innate and adaptive immune pathways. The first line of defense is innate effector cells, mainly macrophages and neutrophils, and the second line of defense is the adaptive immune system, which involves mainly CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. There is a well-documented state of T-cell survival that rapidly develops after bacterial sepsis, which is closely correlated to poorer outcomes of sepsis [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]; however, there are few studies on this phenomenon in fungal sepsis.</p><p>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that primarily controls cell growth and metabolism [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. It consists of two protein complexes, mTOR complex (mTORC)1 and mTORC2; mTORC1 is activated mainly through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase&#x02013;AKT pathway. After its activation, mTORC1 phosphorylates S6 kinase (S6K) and the translational initiation factor 4E binding protein 1. mTORC1 function is negatively regulated by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. The mTOR signaling pathway is extensively involved in lymphocyte biology; numerous immune signals can activate the mTOR pathway, which in turn regulates lymphocyte development, activation and differentiation [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. In addition, the mTOR signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of programmed cell death, namely autophagy and apoptosis [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>].Recent studies have shown another critical role for the mTOR pathway in lymphocyte survival [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>], but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Our previous studies [<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>] found that the mTOR pathway influences the prognosis of Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) through the regulation of CD8&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;T cell differentiation. However, up to date the role of mTOR in invasive candidiasis is still unclear.</p><p>Autophagy is a protein-degradation system. Its main functions are to recycle proteins, remove damaged organelles, eliminate microorganisms, and act in antigen presentation [<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]. Multiple studies have demonstrated that autophagy plays a protective role in several organs during sepsis, and recent work has shown that autophagy also plays a vital role in the survival of lymphocytes [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]. However, the relationship between lymphocyte survival and autophagy in fungal sepsis is not well documented. In the current study, we explored T-cell survival in mice with lethal <italic>Candida</italic> sepsis and investigated the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Mice</title><p>T-cell-specific <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>mTOR</italic> conditional knockout mice (<italic>Lck-cre TSC1<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic> and <italic>Lck-cre mTOR<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic>, respectively) were obtained by crossing <italic>TSC1<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic> and <italic>mTOR<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic> mice, respectively, with mice expressing <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase under the control of the T-cell-specific promoter Lck (lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase). <italic>Lck-cre</italic>-negative <italic>mTOR<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic> littermates served as the control animals.

To this end, we upgraded the candida intravenous challenge model [<xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>], which is one of the recognized models that can mimic clinical candidemia. The severity of this model is directly related to the variety and sex of the mice used, as well as the variety and dose of the strains of <italic>Candida</italic> used in the challenge [<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that the median survival time of mice has an approximately linear relationship with the severity of the disease model, which is indicated by renal fungal counts at 12&#x000a0;h after challenge [<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]. Therefore, we chose a high concentration of 10<sup>6</sup> cfu to produce lethal <italic>Candida</italic> sepsis and collected relevant data 12&#x000a0;h after challenge. In addition, we use the Murine Sepsis Score (MSS) [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>], which is a validated, reliable and independent scoring system for sepsis severity evaluation to further verify our model success [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. As we expected, after infection, the mice showed typical disease symptoms, like ruffled coat caused by reduced grooming, increased/decreased movement, abnormal posture (hunched back), and trembling. The MSS is more than three during the whole experiment, which means the mice all died from sepsis. The median survival time was 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>), which is consistent with the clinical mortality in septic shock caused by <italic>Candida albicans</italic>.

The level of P62/SQSTM1, which is a marker protein for incomplete autophagy flux, was also higher in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in <italic>Candida</italic>-infected mice compared with control mice (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(c,d)</xref>). These results suggest that autophagy in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was incomplete in mice with lethal <italic>Candida</italic> sepsis. To confirm these findings, we also investigated the process of autophagy flux using TEM. The number and morphology of autophagosomes and autolysosomes observed in TEM could well reflect the whole autophagy flux [<xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>]. Especially autolysosomes, as the final digestion stage of autophagy are used to represent complete autophagic flux. We found more autophagosomes in <italic>C. albicans</italic>-infected mice than in control mice (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(e</xref>)), while the autolysosomes in <italic>C. albicans</italic>-infected mice were less abundant and larger than those in control mice.

Our previous study has shown that lymphocyte subsets are closely associated with prognosis during this process, which may partly uncover the difficulty of treatment caused by the immunosuppression that follows systemic infection [<xref rid="CIT0035">35</xref>]. The mechanism of immunosuppression in sepsis caused by other pathogens has already been demonstrated, i.e., apoptosis of several immune cell types including macrophages, T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are reported to play a major role in the pathophysiology of immunosuppression [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. However, the state of immunosuppression in systemic <italic>Candida</italic> infection is not clear. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are known to play a vital role in the adaptive immune response to fungal sepsis, therefore, in the present study, we constructed a model to explore CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival in lethal fungal sepsis. We measured the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen by flow cytometry at 12&#x000a0;h after <italic>Candida</italic> injection. Both the percentage and specific count of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly lower in wild-type mice with bloodstream infection of <italic>C. albicans</italic> compared with uninfected control mice. These results demonstrate that there is a decrease in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in mice during the early stage of <italic>Candida</italic> infection.</p><p>We further investigated the underlying signaling pathway mediating the depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during fungal sepsis. The mTOR signaling pathway is extensively involved in lymphocyte biology, including lymphocyte development, activation and differentiation. A recent study by O&#x02019;Brien et al. found another critical role for the mTOR pathway in lymphocyte survival. They found that deletion of TSC1 in the murine T cell lineage resulted in a dramatic reduction in the peripheral T cell pool, correlating with increased cell death [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. Based on these results, we hypothesized that the mTOR pathway might also play a vital role in the survival/depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in fungal sepsis. We found that expression of p-mTOR and p-p70S6 kinase was higher in wild-type mice with bloodstream <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection compared with uninfected control mice, indicating that the mTOR pathway is activated by lethal <italic>Candida</italic> sepsis. <italic>Candida</italic>-infected mice with T-cell-specific mTOR deletion displayed significantly less CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion, whereas <italic>Candida</italic>-infected mice with T-cell-specific TSC1 deletion mice showed even more CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion, compared with <italic>Candida</italic>-infected wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that the mTOR pathway is involved in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival in fungal sepsis, although the specific mechanism is not revealed.</p><p>Autophagy, also known as type 2 programmed cell death [<xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref>], is a protein-degradation system that is essential for cellular homeostasis. It is mediated by the mTOR pathway and plays a complex role in cell survival. Moderate autophagy can protect cells from death by providing essential metabolic support during nutrient deprivation, while excessive autophagic degradation can also commit the cells to death [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated that autophagy is essential for survival of mature T cells, and that inhibition of autophagy in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells causes accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, leading to increased CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell apoptosis [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]. This result was verified in another study that found that once autophagy is inhibited during sepsis, apoptosis is promoted [<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>]. However, the role of autophagy in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival during fungal sepsis has not been reported. Based on these previous findings, we speculated that autophagy might be part of the underlying mechanism mediating the function of the mTOR pathway in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell survival.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, we first measured expression of autophagy proteins in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from mice with fungal sepsis. According to the guideline [<xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>], LC3B represents the level of autophagy in mammals, and in combination with other indicators such as p62/SQSTM1 and TEM, it fully reflects autophagy flux. We found that expression of both LC3B and p62/SQSTM1 was significantly higher in the bloodstream of mice infected with <italic>C. albicans</italic> compared with uninfected control mice. To explore further the changes in autophagy flux caused by bloodstream infection of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we examined by TEM the autophagy vesicles in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Compared with uninfected control mice, <italic>C. albicans</italic>-infected wild-type mice had more autophagosomes, but fewer and larger autolysosomes. These results demonstrate that although the formation of autophagosomes in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is increased by lethal <italic>Candida</italic> sepsis, the process of autophagy flux in these cells remains incomplete.</p><p>We next investigated the function of the mTOR pathway in the regulation of autophagy during fungal sepsis. For mice with severe invasive candidiasis, expression of LC3B and p62/SQSTM1 was higher in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-specific mTOR knockout mice but lower in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-specific TSC1 knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. We also examined the autophagy process in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection using TEM and found that, compared with wild-type mice, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-specific mTOR knockout mice had more autophagosomes but fewer and larger autolysosomes. These results suggest that the mTOR pathway mainly regulates the autophagy process in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells via mediating formation of autophagosomes rather than by promoting the process of autophagy vesicle degradation. We also found that, compared with wild-type mice, the number of annexin-V-positive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection was lower in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-specific mTOR knockout mice but was higher in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-specific TSC1 knockout mice. These results indicate that inhibition of the mTOR pathway can decrease the apoptosis rate of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in mice with lethal <italic>Candida</italic> sepsis. Lastly, we measured expression of the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>BIM</italic>. During lethal <italic>Candida</italic> sepsis, <italic>BIM</italic> expression was lower in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-specific mTOR knockout mice but was higher in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-specific TSC1 knockout mice. Therefore, mTOR may regulate survival of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in fungal sepsis partly through the autophagy&#x02013;apoptosis pathway. Most interestingly, there was a significant difference in mortality between CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-specific mTOR knockout and TSC1 knockout mice and wild-type mice with severe invasive candidiasis. Compared with wild-type mice, T-cell-specific mTOR knockout mice had a higher survival rate after fungal sepsis, whereas T-cell-specific TSC1 knockout mice had a lower survival rate after fungal sepsis. Our study highlighted the role of mTOR in the process of fungal sepsis by regulating autophagy and apoptosis of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are affected in this process, leading to changes in survival rate. This is consistent with the cecal ligation puncture (CLP) sepsis model [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]. Therefore, we did not measure fungal burden in the target organs. In future experiments, we may further explore the relationship between T cell autophagy and fungal infection by detecting fungal burden.</p><p>In conclusion, we suggest that the immune response, signaling pathways and targets may be consistent in sepsis caused by bloodstream infection, regardless of whether the pathogen is bacterial, fungal or viral. This is important for intervention in sepsis caused by bloodstream infection and improvement of survival rate. These results suggest a new target and strategy for fungal sepsis immunosuppression.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank Dr. Yong Zhao (State Key Laboratory of Biomembrane and Membrane Biotechnology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China) for generously providing the <italic>TSC1</italic><sup>loxp/loxp</sup> mice, <italic>mTOR</italic><sup>loxp/loxp</sup> mice and <italic>Lck-cre</italic> mice.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Kullberg</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Arendrup</surname><given-names>MC.</given-names></name></person-group>
