Our previous studies identified the gastrointestinal tract as a site of HAdV persistence, but the role of intestinal virus shedding pre-transplant for the risk of ensuing invasive infection has not been entirely elucidated. Molecular HAdV monitoring of serial stool samples using RQ-PCR was performed in 304 children undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Analysis of stool and peripheral blood specimens was performed pre-transplant and at short intervals until day 100 post-HSCT. The virus was detected in the stool of 129 patients (42%), and 42 tested positive already before HSCT. The patients displaying HAdV shedding pre-transplant showed a significantly earlier increase of intestinal HAdV levels above the critical threshold associated with high risk of invasive infection (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01). In this subset of patients, the occurrence of invasive infection characterized by viremia was significantly higher than in patients without HAdV shedding before HSCT (33% vs 7%; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). The data demonstrate that intestinal HAdV shedding before HSCT confers a greatly increased risk for invasive infection and disseminated disease post-transplant, and highlights the need for timely HAdV monitoring and pre-emptive therapeutic considerations in HSCT recipients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Intestinal HAdV persistence confers an increased risk for invasive infection post-HSCT.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">In HSCT-recipients with intestinal HAdV shedding, the virus levels mostly increase rapidly during the first days post-HSCT.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Monitoring of HAdV shedding before HSCT is important for identifying patients at high risk for early onset of viremia.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Human adenovirus</kwd><kwd>Invasive infections</kwd><kwd>Stool specimens</kwd><kwd>Stem cell transplanted patients</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0020">Human adenovirus (HAdV) infections are associated with life-threatening complications in immunocompromised individuals including particularly children undergoing human allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Feghoul et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lion et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Mynarek et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">van Tol et al., 2005</xref>). In this setting, viral reactivation is reportedly more prevalent than de-novo infection (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Veltrop-Duits et al., 2011</xref>). Primary infections in immunocompetent individuals occur most commonly in early childhood, often without any clinical symptoms, but HAdV can subsequently persist in tonsillar and adenoidal lymphocytes as well as in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Garnett et al., 2002</xref>). The role of the GI-tract as a sanctuary for HAdV persistence has been discussed for decades, because shedding of the virus into stool was found in immunocompetent individuals even without any evidence of disease (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Adrian et al., 1988</xref>). In HSCT recipients, increasing HAdV loads in serial stool specimens have been documented during the post-transplant period prior to invasive infection, supporting the notion of intestinal virus persistence and reactivation (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Feghoul et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lion et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Jeulin et al., 2011</xref>). Our recent study in immunocompetent pediatric patients revealed HAdV persistence in mucosal lymphoid cells in the GI-tract, with particularly high prevalence in the ileum, whereas in HSCT recipients with HAdV reactivation post-transplant, an enormous virus density has been documented in intestinal epithelial cells (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Kosulin et al., 2016a</xref>). These observations revealed that intestinal lymphocytes apparently serve as a major site of HAdV persistence, but epithelial cells in the GI-tract are exploited for massive virus production (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Kosulin et al., 2016a</xref>). The highly productive virus replication in epithelial cells explains the rapidly expanding virus numbers in stool specimens of HSCT recipients prior to the onset of viremia and disseminated disease (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Feghoul et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lion et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Mynarek et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Berciaud et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">According to the current ECIL (European Conference of Infections in Leukemia) guidelines, peripheral blood (PB) samples are recommended as the primary material for HAdV screening in HSCT recipients (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Matthes-Martin et al., 2012</xref>). There is, however, increasing evidence reported by different centers that rapidly increasing HAdV DNA copy numbers exceeding defined threshold levels in serial stool samples herald invasive infection days to weeks before the virus becomes detectable in PB (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Feghoul et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lion et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Mynarek et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Jeulin et al., 2011</xref>). The monitoring of HAdV DNA copy numbers in stool could therefore serve as a basis for timely initiation of pre-emptive therapy, in attempts to prevent invasive infection. Disseminated HAdV-mediated disease is associated with dismal outcome, partly because delayed onset of therapy by current treatment options often fails to control adenovirus-related complications (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Feuchtinger et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Lion, 2014</xref>). Since HAdV persistence in the GI-tract of immunocompetent children and post-transplant reactivation of the virus in pediatric patients were shown to occur at similar frequencies (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Kosulin et al., 2016a</xref>), we hypothesized that detection of HAdV shedding into stool before HSCT may provide an early marker for the risk of viremia and HAdV-related disease post-transplant. To address this notion, the present study involving a large cohort of pediatric HSCT recipients was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p id="p0030">The samples studied included serial stool and peripheral blood specimens from 304 consecutive patients (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) who underwent allogeneic HSCT at the St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria, between 2000 and 2015.

Only patients with available stool samples before HSCT were included.

Although primary HAdV infections have been documented in transplant recipients, the majority of cases apparently arise from reactivation of the virus, which can establish persistence upon primary infection (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Kosulin et al., 2016a</xref>). Current data indicate that the GI-tract is the most important site of HAdV reactivation in the clinical context of pediatric HSCT. This notion is supported by the recently reported intestinal HAdV persistence in children (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Kosulin et al., 2016a</xref>), and the observation that invasive infection in pediatric HSCT recipients is generally preceded by documented presence and expansion of the virus in stool (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Feghoul et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lion et al., 2010</xref>). Additional evidence includes the similar prevalence of persistent HAdV in the GI-tract and the proportion of children with post-transplant virus reactivation, as well as the nearly identical distribution of adenoviral species in both instances (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Kosulin et al., 2016a</xref>). The latter observation is in line with the highly concordant pre-and post-transplant occurrence of HAdV species in stool samples in the present study (<xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The observation of low median virus copy numbers in stool before transplantation (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B) might reflect a persistent state of intestinal virus infection associated with low-level viral leakage into the stool, as indicated in our recent study (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Kosulin et al., 2016a</xref>). Intestinal HAdV shedding before transplantation documented in the present study, which in most instances was evident prior to conditioning, further supports the notion that presence of the virus in the in the GI-tract appears to be in the state of persistence rather than latency. In patients with inborn or acquired severe immunodeficiency, intestinal shedding of the virus pre-transplant might reflect an early onset of reactivation. In individuals with most other underlying diseases providing an indication for HSCT, virus reactivation is apparently triggered by immunosuppression during the post-transplant period (<xref rid="ec0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Based on the present data, intestinal HAdV persistence associated with virus shedding into the stool prior to transplantation represents a risk factor for ensuing viremia which can be readily exploited in routine diagnostic monitoring in pertinent patient cohorts. It is conceivable that patients with persistent HAdV infection in the GI-tract represent the most important group at risk of reactivating the virus post-transplant, but the identification of viral persistence would require the analysis of intestinal biopsy material obtained by endoscopy, which may not be generally feasible in this clinical setting. However, molecular detection of HAdV shedding into the stool pre-transplant is an easily applicable non-invasive approach facilitating the identification of a subset of patients with persistence of the virus in the GI-tract carrying an elevated risk of systemic infection and disseminated disease. This observation corroborates earlier findings in smaller cohorts indicating that pediatric patients without detectable HAdV in stool apparently have a very low risk of developing invasive infection in the clinical setting of HCST (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Kosulin et al., 2016a</xref>). Conversely, in line with earlier data, the risk of viremia is significantly increased in patients testing positive for the virus in stool (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Feghoul et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lion et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Jeulin et al., 2011</xref>). Children with documented intestinal HAdV shedding prior to HSCT displayed particularly rapid viral expansion in serial stool samples exceeding 10E6 copies/g, the critical threshold for the probability of invasive infection (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lion et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Jeulin et al., 2011</xref>), already within 21&#x000a0;days post-transplant (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). These observations suggest that pre-transplant detection of HAdV in stool correlates with an elevated risk of early invasive infection, thus highlighting the importance of timely viral screening in stool specimens (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Feghoul et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Lion et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Jeulin et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, the presence of critically high HAdV DNA copy numbers in stool very early after HSCT might also herald impending onset of invasive infection prior to incipient immune reconstitution, thus possibly predisposing for particularly severe clinical manifestations. Since early initiation of treatment was shown to be critical for successful management of HAdV infections in this clinical setting (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Feuchtinger et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Lion, 2014</xref>), the time point of first HAdV occurrence in stool specimens could be of relevance for appropriate therapeutic considerations. In this regard, pre-transplant HAdV detection in stool may provide the impetus for postponing elective transplantations and offering early pre-emptive treatment in high-risk settings. This strategy might be considered particularly in patients with more than anecdotal HAdV positivity in serial stool specimens pre-transplant, with rather high virus copy numbers already at this stage. Although this approach could result in the overtreatment of a considerable proportion of patients who might clear the virus even without therapeutic intervention, this option would appear reasonable provided that relatively non-toxic treatment options were available. It is conceivable that early initiation of therapy aiming at the prevention of invasive virus infection and disseminated disease might contribute to improving outcome. However, the risk of invasive infection must be judiciously balanced against the potential side effects of current treatment approaches. The availability of safer therapy options, such as the new compound Brincidofovir (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Chittick et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Hiwarkar et al., 2017</xref>), might facilitate the decision for early antiviral treatment once the efficacy of pre-emptive treatment is firmly established. Moreover, the timely employment and success of adoptive transfer of HAdV-specific T-cells using donor-derived (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Geyeregger et al., 2014</xref>) or third-party cells (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Arasaratnam and Leen, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Eiz-Vesper et al., 2012</xref>) could be further improved by early recognition of high-risk patients in order to permit optimal planning and timing of T-cell generation or acquisition. The present study in a large cohort of pediatric patients provides evidence for the higher risk of viremia in individuals shedding HAdV into the stool prior to HCST, and greatly reinforces our earlier findings (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Kosulin et al., 2016a</xref>). The current insights therefore provide a rational basis for further clinical studies on early pre-emptive treatment approaches to determine the potential impact on successful management of HAdV infections in highly immunocompromised patients.</p><p id="p0095">The following is the supplementary data related to this article.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0005"><caption><title>Supplemental Table 1</title><p>Characteristics of patients with HAdV shedding before HSCT.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc1.docx"><alt-text>Supplemental Table 1</alt-text></media></supplementary-material></p></sec><sec id="s0060"><title>Funding Sources</title><p id="p0105">The study was funded by <funding-source id="gts0005">Institutional Research Funds</funding-source>.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Potential Conflicts of Interest</title><p id="p0110">T.
