We hypothesized that preterm neonates have immature systemic immunity with distinct developmental trajectory for the first several weeks of life, relative to those born at near-term or term. Using pigs as a model, we characterized blood leukocyte subsets, antimicrobial activities and TLR-mediated cytokine production during the first weeks after preterm birth. Relative to near-term and term pigs, newborn preterm pigs had low blood leukocyte counts, poor neutrophil phagocytic rate, and limited cytokine responses to TLR1/2/5/7/9 and NOD1/2 agonists. The preterm systemic responses remained immature during the first postnatal week, but thereafter showed increased blood leukocyte numbers, NK cell proportion, neutrophil phagocytic rate and TLR2-mediated IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; production. These immune parameters remained different between preterm and near-term pigs at 2&#x02013;3 weeks, even when adjusted for post-conceptional age. Our data suggest that systemic immunity follows a distinct developmental trajectory following preterm birth that may be influenced by postnatal age, complications of prematurity and environmental factors. Consequently, the immediate postnatal period may represent a window of opportunity to improve innate immunity in preterm neonates by medical, antimicrobial or dietary interventions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Every year, 15&#x02009;million infants are born preterm (&#x0003c;37 weeks of gestation) with a mortality rate of up to 10%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Those who are born very preterm (&#x0003c;32 weeks) are extremely susceptible to infections and intestinal diseases due to the immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract and immune system, i.e. 20&#x02013;40% of these hospitalized infants develop necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and/or sepsis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. NEC affects 7% of very low birth weight infants (&#x0003c;1500&#x02009;g, VLBW) with a mortality of up to 50% for those subjected to surgical intervention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The pathogenesis and etiology of NEC are still incompletely understood after several decades of research but prematurity, abnormal gut bacterial colonization and aggressive enteral feeding, especially with infant formula, may be key predisposing factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. For sepsis, mortality is much lower than for NEC, but the incidence is much higher, up to 60% in VLBW infants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Early onset sepsis (EOS) occurs within the first 3 days after birth and is thought to be caused mainly by maternal transfer of invasive microorganisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Late-onset sepsis (LOS) is defined as sepsis after day 3 and is more likely derived from postnatal acquisition of pathogens from the environment, including <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, partly entering the body via indwelling catheters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In addition, LOS may result from bacterial translocation across the immature gut, as blood cultures from neonates with LOS and bacteremia often reflects their gut bacterial composition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Infection induced by bacterial translocation may be most prevalent shortly after preterm birth and before gut closure, especially when the immature gut has not yet been exposed to the maturational and barrier-supporting effects of mother&#x02019;s milk (e.g. sIgA for passive immunity)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Both LOS and NEC can progress rapidly after clinical presentation, and accurate diagnosis is important to initiate proper therapy such as antibiotics, bowel rest or gut surgery in case of severe NEC. Despite tremendous efforts to identify diagnostic markers for LOS and NEC (e.g. C-reactive protein, IL-6, serum amyloid A), none of them are accurate and specific enough for clinical use<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>Birth represents a sudden change from a protected intrauterine environment to the extrauterine environment with exposure to billions of bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. An immune-suppressed physiological state is required for the fetus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, but this must change after birth to cope with environmental bacteria. In newborn preterm infants, blood leukocytes are deficient in expression of surface receptors (CD14, MD-2, Toll-like receptors, TLRs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, leading to impaired immune response upon bacterial challenges and higher susceptibility to infectious diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. For example, deficient TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; responses impair Th1 polarization and neutrophil functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Preterm infants also have lower levels of antimicrobial factors in various organs (e.g. bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, defensins and cathelicidin in the lungs, gut and circulation)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, poor phagocytic rate of blood neutrophils and monocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, and reduced capacity to release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) for bacterial killing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>We have established a model in preterm pigs that displays many of the clinical signs present after preterm birth in infants (e.g. immature function of many organ systems, including lungs, together with high sensitivity to NEC and LOS) when piglets are born at 90% gestation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Direct comparison of 90% gestation preterm pigs with preterm infants is difficult and depends on gestational age (e.g. 60&#x02013;80% in preterm infants) and varies among organs (e.g. lungs, gut, liver, brain). Regardless, the model allows study of multiple clinically-relevant treatments, such as respiratory and cardiovascular support, together with parenteral and enteral nutrition with repeated blood sampling for characterization of immune parameters. Cord blood of preterm pigs has very low leukocyte numbers, especially neutrophil numbers, compared with term and adult pigs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, which is similar to conditions in newborn preterm infants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Blood neutrophils are the major innate cell subset and key effector of the innate immune defense with capacity of exerting antimicrobial functions such as phagocytosis, NETs and modulation of cytokine response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Newborn preterm pigs are severely neutropenic and neutrophil counts do not change significantly during the first five days of life, probably in part explaining the poor innate host defense during this period<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In both preterm infants and pigs, LOS and NEC occur most frequently during the first few weeks of life but it remains unclear if this is mirrored by impaired systemic immunity at this time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.

This, together with the provision of enteral antibiotics when indicated, may have helped to secure that our milk-fed preterm pigs showed no signs of systemic or gut infections. Nevertheless, the NET response and neutrophil phagocytic rate of Gram-positive bacteria remained less potent in preterm vs. near-term pigs in weeks 2&#x02013;3, suggesting a persistent delay for some innate immune functions. Conversely, TLR2-induced cytokine responses and neutrophil phagocytosis of Gram-negative bacteria in weeks 2&#x02013;3 were higher in preterm vs. near-term pigs, indicating a high degree of postnatal compensatory response to preterm birth. Overall, our study suggests that systemic immunity in preterm pigs is immature during the first week of life and develop and mature in a distinct postnatal trajectory, relative to that in near-term pigs at the same postnatal age. Of note, when the immune parameters were compared at the same post-conceptional age, e.g. between preterm pigs at day 10&#x02013;11 and near-term pigs at birth (delivered 10 days later than preterm), all measured parameters differed. This suggests that the developmental trajectory of systemic immunity in preterm neonates reflects more than just a response to advancing ontogenic age, but is affected also by factors such as external environment, variable antibiotic treatment and the body responses to preterm birth (e.g. impaired organ functions including a degree of respiratory distress).</p><p>For comparison between infants and pigs in this context, it could be important that preterm infants are born with reduced immunoglobulin (Ig) levels following their shortened time for transplacental transport of Igs before birth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, while both preterm and near-term pigs are devoid of any IgG passage from their mothers before birth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In pigs, this passive immunity is normally transferred to the newborns via their mother&#x02019;s colostrum in the days just after birth, making use of the endocytic capacity of pig intestinal enterocytes to absorb Igs. This Ig uptake capacity is also present in the intestine of preterm pigs although lower than in near-term pigs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Both IgG and factors such as CRP are known to be important mediators of immune functions and may act as opsonins to facilitate phagocytosis. In our study, we controlled for this potentially confounding factor of differing levels of passive Ig levels by providing both preterm and near-term pigs the same minimal dose of passive immunity via the same volume of maternal plasma per kg body weight during the first 48&#x02009;h, without any provision of their mother&#x02019;s colostrum. Following this postnatal passive immunization, preterm pigs achieved a plasma IgG level of ~4&#x02009;g/L, which is similar to the level in preterm infants delivered at less than 30 weeks of gestation (3&#x02013;4&#x02009;g/L)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p><p>During the first 4 weeks of life, preterm pigs suffered more from diarrhea and poor weight gain than piglets delivered close to term, possibly reflecting their immature digestive capacity but potentially also metabolic and immunological deficits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Regardless, there were no clinical signs of NEC (e.g. abdominal distention, vomiting, bloody diarrhea) during the study period, reflecting the relatively NEC-protective diet of intact raw bovine milk used in this study, combined with some antibiotic treatments. In healthy preterm infants, the I/T ratio is quite variable but usually less than 0.22 and plasma CRP was less than 10&#x02009;mg/L<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In our study, the I/T ratio was low during the first two weeks and was 0.24&#x02013;0.27 in weeks 3&#x02013;4. Plasma CRP levels were &#x0003c;10&#x02009;mg/L in most of the pigs, and thus lower than in septic patients (&#x0003e;10&#x02009;mg/mL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) and in inflamed pigs (&#x0003e;15&#x02009;mg/mL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). In addition, we did not observe thrombocytopenia, a clinical sign that is often associated with NEC and sepsis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. These results, together with the lack of clinical signs of respiratory distress or organ failure at the end of the study, indicate that the preterm pigs in this study did not suffer from severe infections or septic conditions during the first four weeks of life. Consequently, the observed age-related changes in immune parameters likely reflect a normal, rather than a disease-stimulated, physiological maturation of the systemic immune system in preterm neonates.</p><p>Similar to newborn preterm infants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, newborn preterm pigs showed impaired TLR-mediated cytokine production, together with poor neutrophil phagocytic rate and NET response in cord blood. Specifically for cytokines, circulating IL-6 and IL-1 are important to induce hepatocytes to release acute phase proteins such as CRP, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and mannose-binding lectin that help to inhibit pathogen actions and detoxify microbial toxins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Further, TNF-&#x003b1; and other cytokines may play an important role in supporting neutrophil phagocytic functions and guiding the adaptive immune response by polarizing na&#x000ef;ve T cells into Th1, Th2, Treg or Th17<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Impaired cytokine production following TLR agonist challenge in preterm pigs at birth is likely due to defective expression of leukocyte receptors, such as CD14, TLRs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, or of second-messenger signaling intermediates, such as IRAK-4 or MyD88 proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Interestingly, previous mechanistic studies revealed that inhibition of the intermediate IRAK-4 is derived from the action of microRNAs, such as miR146, which is highly expressed in cord blood monocytes, relative to adult monocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. On the other hand, the poor phagocytic function of neutrophils in preterm pigs at birth can partly be explained by low concentrations of opsonins in plasma, such as Igs and CRP. Further, preterm neonates also show deficient levels of blood neutrophil lactoferrin and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. This may play a role for the impaired capacity of neutrophils to release NETs and kill bacteria, as now shown in preterm pigs, similar to recent results from preterm infants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>In preterm pigs, the TLR-mediated cytokine production and plasma CRP levels increased in weeks 2&#x02013;3, concomitantly with increases in leukocyte and neutrophil counts, NK cell and CD16<sup>+</sup> monocyte proportions, phagocytosis and NET responses. Collectively, the data suggest that if the preterm neonate survives the first critical week, the development of more mature immune defense mechanisms in the following weeks may help to support the subsequent infection resistance. Further studies are required to investigate if the trajectory of these immunological developmental events can be modulated by nutritional, antimicrobial and medical interventions to help prevent inadequate or adverse responses to systemic bacteria.</p><p>We used elevated plasma cfDNA levels following <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation, as an indicator of NET formation from neutrophils<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, and neither preterm nor near-term cord blood had any NET response following PMA or LPS challenge. This is consistent with the observed negligible NET formation by preterm and term infant cord blood neutrophils following stimulation with PMA, LPS or platelet-activating factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. When using <italic>C. albicans</italic> fungal challenge, term infant cord blood neutrophils exerted potent NET formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, reflecting that the NET-forming capacity is partly challenge-specific. Preterm pigs demonstrated increased PMA-induced NET formation of blood neutrophils in weeks 2&#x02013;3, but lower levels of LPS-induced NET formation than that found in near-term pigs. A similar trend was observed with elevated, but lower neutrophil phagocytic rates of Gram-positive bacteria in preterm versus near-term pigs during weeks 2&#x02013;3. This indicates a delayed immune development in preterm pigs despite the maturation occurring after the first week. Furthermore, the dramatic increase in TLR2-mediated IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; response after the first week in preterm pigs relative to near-term pigs suggests a compensatory immune mechanism induced by the environmental challenges after preterm birth. This may facilitate additional antimicrobial mechanisms such as TNF-&#x003b1;-induced enhanced phagocytosis or IL-6-induced complement pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> to compensate for other delayed functions (e.g. impaired NET response).</p><p>Our work has provided new knowledge about the distinct development of the systemic immune responses in preterm neonates. The specific developmental trajectory is likely to result from both the shortened gestational age at birth and the postnatal consequences of preterm birth such as environmental exposure combined with a degree of premature organ dysfunctions. This model can be used to study interventions that may improve systemic immunity in early life of preterm neonates, including treatments to increase circulating immunoglobulin levels (passive immunization), anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial interventions, and immunomodulatory milk diets.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animal experimental procedures and blood sampling</title><p>The animal procedure was approved by the Danish National Committee of Animal Experimentation. All methods in the study were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations. Preterm pigs (Large White&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Danish Landrace&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Duroc) were delivered by caesarean section at day 106 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;92, 49 male and 43 female pigs, from 5 sows, 90% of gestation, term age is 117&#x02013;118 days). Caesarean-delivered near-term pigs (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;21, 8 male and 13 female pigs, from 1 sow, day 116) and term pigs (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4 from 1 sow, day 118) were used for comparison. No antenatal corticosteroids were used. After delivery, piglets were transferred into individual incubators with oxygen supply (0.5&#x02013;2&#x02009;L/min) for the first 24&#x02009;h. Preterm and near-term pigs were fed parenteral nutrition during the first week (3 days for near-term pigs, 3&#x02013;7 days for preterm pigs, 48&#x02013;144&#x02009;mL/kg/day) via umbilical catheter, and enteral nutrition with raw bovine milk (16&#x02013;200&#x02009;ml/kg/day every 3&#x02009;h) until 3&#x02013;4 weeks (19&#x02013;23 days) of age, when pigs were euthanized. Parenteral nutrition in preterm pigs was maintained for 3 days in the first two litters but was extended to 7 days in the last three litters for extra fluid provision to compensate for some degree of diarrhea and dehydration during the first week of life. Raw bovine milk, with retained bioactive components, was used as the enteral diet to avoid severe gastrointestinal complications such as NEC. Similar to preterm infants, the preterm pigs were initially fed minimal enteral nutrition with a gradual increase in feeding volume from 16&#x02009;ml/kg/day (day 1) to 128&#x02009;ml/kg/day (day 7), before switching to total enteral nutrition from day 8 and onwards. When there were signs of feeding intolerance, reduced boluses were given to avoid further complications. During the first 48&#x02009;h after delivery, pigs were provided passive systemic immunization with maternal plasma (16&#x02013;25&#x02009;ml/kg). Fecal characteristics were scored twice daily: 0, no stool; 1, meconium or firm feces; 2, pasty feces; 3, diarrhea with droplets of watery feces; 4, moderate diarrhea and 5, severe diarrhea. When there were signs of dehydration and severe diarrhea, pigs were treated, for 3 consecutive days, with enteral antibiotics comprising 2.5&#x02009;mg/kg gentamicin twice daily (Gentocin Vet, ScanVet, Fredensborg, Demark) and 30&#x02009;mg/kg ampicillin twice daily (Norobrittin Vet, ScanVet).
