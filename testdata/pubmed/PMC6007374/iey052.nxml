Spray-dried powders of whole bovine blood, chicken egg, and milk substitute constituted the nutritional components of the traditional artificial larval diet used for mass rearing New World Screwworm (NWS), <italic>Cochliomyia hominivorax</italic> (Coquerel), Diptera: Calliphoridae. However, due to shifting availability and increasing costs of diet ingredients, it is necessary to investigate alternative products for the diet. Recently, spray-dried whole bovine blood became unavailable for purchase in the quantities that the Screwworm Program requires and thus were obliged to purchase bovine blood subproducts. Previous research showed that bovine hemoglobin could be substituted for whole blood with good results in small trials. Here, we report results of NWS larval diets prepared with bovine blood subproducts, hemoglobin and plasma, in 20-liter trays used in mass rearing. Diets were prepared using three separate hemoglobin/plasma ratios. Though all three configurations of hemoglobin and plasma were successful in the larval diet, we found the diets containing 1.5% total plasma, as opposed to 0.5 and 1%, produced heavier larvae and pupae, and resulted in more pupae per unit of diet. Considering cost, we determined that the ideal ratio for the blood portion of the diet for mass rearing is 80% hemoglobin and 20% plasma.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Cochliomyia hominivorax</italic></kwd><kwd>screwworm</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>insect rearing</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>New World screwworm (NWS), <italic>Cochliomyia hominivorax</italic> (Coquerel) is a Dipteran parasitic insect pest of warm-blooded vertebrates found throughout most of South America and among five Caribbean countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago). Myiasis takes place within the larval life stages of the fly, where eggs laid along open wounds or naval areas of newly born animals. Immediately following eclosion, stage 1 larvae begin eating at the living tissue of the host, forming deep feeding pockets and causing injury, disease, and even death. In turn, this can equate to an economic loss in leather, meat, and milk production, as well as an extreme health risk for populations in endemic areas (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Vargas-Teran et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>With an original distribution occupying Mexico as well within the southern United States, successful eradication and control of NWS has been achieved over the past 60 years in North and Central America using the sterile insect technique (SIT) originally developed by Knipling and Bushland (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Bushland and Hopkins 1953</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bushland et al. 1955</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Knipling 1955</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Wyss 2000</xref>). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Screwworm Program, currently managed by the Panama&#x02013;United States Commission for the Eradication and Prevention of Screwworm (COPEG), maintains a sterile NWS production facility in Panama. Sterile flies from this facility are dispersed weekly in eastern Panama and into Colombia to prevent re-infestation from South American into NWS-free countries. Although the program is costly, the cost benefit ratio to U.S. producers is estimated to be 1:100, and 1:450 for the national economy (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Vargas-Teran et al. 2005</xref>). In the case of an outbreak in Texas, for example, the cost to Texan livestock producers alone would climb higher than $560 million, and contribute to a total Texan economic loss of more than $1.4 billion (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">NPIC 2016</xref>).</p><p>One of the most critical and costly components of the Screwworm Program is the larval diet. The screwworm larval diet has changed considerably since its development by <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Melvin and Bushland (1936</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1940</xref>) as a mixture of ground beef and citrated bovine blood due to the availability, expense and quantity of ingredients required to maintain a mass rearing colony (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen 2014</xref>), and the development of food processing technology. Over time, the source of nutritional elements of the larval screwworm diet has evolved from use of raw foods such as hamburger and poultry eggs to the use of dry powdered ingredients, with different inert additives used for diet structure (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Gingrich et al. 1971</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al. 1984</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhury and Skoda 2007</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhury et al. 2015</xref>). Prior to the obligated use of spray-dried bovine blood by-products, the latest version of the NWS diet consisted of spray-dried whole bovine blood (SDWB) (APC Inc., Ankeny, IA), spray-dried whole or reduced fat egg and dry powdered milk substitute (Calva Products Inc., Acampo, CA), and cellulose fiber (CF-100, Central Fiber, J. Rettenmaier USA LP, Schoolcraft, MI) for diet structure. The dry ingredients are rehydrated with water, adding formaldehyde for microbial control. Though this diet recipe had functioned well for the NWS program since 2007 (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2014</xref>), the active ingredients in the larval diet are constantly subject to change due to availability and changes in food processing technologies.</p><p>Recently, market shifts have negatively affected the availability of SDWB for the Screwworm Program. Large producers have adapted to market demand and currently supply hemoglobin and blood plasma as separate commodities, thus necessitating the study of these products for the NWS larval diet.</p><p>Here, we present results of studies conducted using multiple bovine blood fractions (hemoglobin and plasma) in the NWS larval insect diet to confirm their use as practical and economical alternative ingredients.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Target Values for Larvae and Pupae</title><p>The Screwworm Program maintains strict size limits for larvae and pupae.

This process was designed to slowly scale a tentative dietary change from a small 3-liter scale, to a full rack over three generations to test strain stability involving said differences, and finally completing its process within a full production run.</p><table-wrap id="T5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>Multistep process utilized to incorporate rearing changes within the COPEG facility</p></caption><table frame="vsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scale</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Test phase</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Small</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Initial: 3-liter trays</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Determine larval acceptance and effects on larval development.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Small</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20-liter</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Compare</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medium</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Half rack</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 trays used for treatments and control</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medium</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Full rack</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 trays used for treatments and control</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medium</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Three-generation full rack</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Full rack, production maintained for three generations to observe stability of life history parameters</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Large</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Half production</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Feed half of mass production with &#x02018;new&#x02019; diet and compare insect measures to current diet fed to remaining half of production</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Large</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Full production</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Changes finally approved at the highest level, and treatments are incorporated into the facility&#x02019;s SOP.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The significant statistical differences between trials in our research reflect the working conditions within the larger rooms of the mass rearing facility in which they were reared. An increase in repetitions throughout multiple locations within the rearing rooms, as well as greater environmental controls or a smaller rearing area specifically utilized for small-scale research would aid in eliminating such variation in the future. On the other hand, the benefit of utilizing large-scale production areas acts as a validation test when used in conjunction with quantifiable research, as this more accurately replicates the conditions the larvae will experience in the mass rearing process.</p><p>The aim of this study was to test, first and foremost, whether these new diet ingredients would be accepted by the larvae. As our results showed, these diet combinations produced acceptable size larvae and pupae. Further experiments are now underway to determine other important life parameters necessary for the success of an SIT program to include, adult emergence, sex ratio, fly longevity, flight ability, fecundity, and fertility of produced eggs, all through several generations. However, good quality pupae are a strong precursor toward the aforementioned properties being generally acceptable and the resulting emergence valuable for SIT, barring the rare cases involving mishandling during the irradiation or field release process.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Mention of trade names or commercial products in this article is solely for the purpose of providing specific information and does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References Cited</title><ref id="CIT0001"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
