TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> binds specifically to HIV-1 capsid (CA) through its B30.2/PRYSPRY domain shortly after entry of the virus into the cytoplasm. Recently, three putative SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs) have been identified in the PRYSPRY domain of human and macaque TRIM5&#x003b1;. However, structural modeling of this domain suggested that two of them were buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein, implying that interaction with SUMO was implausible, while the third one was not relevant to restriction. In light of these results, we re-analyzed the TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> PRYSPRY sequence and identified an additional putative SIM (<sup>435</sup>VIIC<sup>438</sup>) which we named SIM4. This motif is exposed at the surface of the PRYSPRY domain, allowing potential interactions with SUMO or SUMOylated proteins. Introducing a double mutation in SIM4 (V435K, I436K) did not alter stability, unlike mutations in SIM1. SIM4-mutated TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> failed to bind HIV-1CA and lost the ability to restrict this virus. Accordingly, SIM4 undergoes significant variation among primates and substituting this motif with naturally occurring SIM4 variants affected HIV-1 restriction by TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub>, suggesting a direct role in capsid recognition. Interestingly, SIM4-mutated TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> also failed to activate NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1-mediated transcription. Although there is no direct evidence that SIM4 is involved in direct interaction with SUMO or a SUMOylated protein, mutating this motif strongly reduced co-localization of TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> with SUMO-1 and with PML, a SUMOylated nuclear protein. In conclusion, this new putative SIM is crucial for both direct interaction with incoming capsids and for NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1 signaling. We speculate that the latter function is mediated by interactions of SIM4 with a SUMOylated protein involved in the NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1 signaling pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cellular aspects of innate immunity</kwd><kwd>Proteins</kwd><kwd>Virology</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd><kwd>Innate immune system</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins from the TRIM5 family are known for their restriction activity against retroviruses [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Restriction mediated by TRIM5&#x003b1; relies on its ability to recognize the viral CA core shortly after entry of the virus in the cell, in a virus-specific and species-specific manner <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. TRIM5&#x003b1; contains RING, B-Box, coiled-coil (RBCC) domains [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the C-terminal SPRY domain (also called B30.2 or PRYSPRY <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>). TRIM5&#x003b1; orthologs differ mostly in the 3 variable regions (V1,V2 and V3) of PRYSPRY <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> which confer specificity for the retroviral CA <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>; for instance, HIV-1 is inhibited by rhesus macaque TRIM5&#x003b1; (TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub>), but generally not by the human version of the protein <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The B-Box and coiled-coil domains are involved in TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> dimerization and higher-order multimerization, properties that are likely important for the formation of cytoplasmic bodies (CBs) observable by light microscopy [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The RING domain has E3-ubiquitin ligase activity essential for auto-ubiquitylation of the protein and efficient restriction <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Interactions between TRIM5&#x003b1; and the retroviral CA N-terminal domain destabilize the CA lattice [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As a result, the CA core undergoes disassembly and some of its components are degraded, as well as TRIM5&#x003b1; itself [<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. TRIM5&#x003b1; also impairs viral transport to the nucleus [<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Another function has recently been attributed to TRIM5&#x003b1;: the activation of innate immunity pathways dependent on AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The RING domain recruits the E2-ubiquitin conjugating enzyme heterodimer Ubc13 (Ube2N)/Ube2V2 (Uev2) to generate lysine 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin chains that can be anchored onto TRIM5&#x003b1; through the action of another E2 enzyme, Ebe2W <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The presence of K63-linked ubiquitin chains has been proposed to be important for AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B transactivation [<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 by TRIM5&#x003b1; is triggered by contact with a restriction sensitive virus <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> or by transient transfection of TRIM5&#x003b1; [<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but not by stable lentiviral transduction <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>The human genome contains three functional <italic>SUMO</italic> genes encoding small-ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) -1/2/3 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification involved in many cellular pathways [<xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. SUMO modifies targeted proteins through its covalent attachment to lysines present in a specific consensus site: &#x003a8;-K-X-D/E <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs) are necessary for the non-covalent interaction of proteins with free SUMO <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> or with SUMOylated proteins <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and consist of a short domain rich in hydrophobic residues <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. TRIM5&#x003b1; proteins have a consensus SUMOylation site at a position immediately upstream of the RING domain and three putative motifs in the PRYSPRY domain were proposed to function as SIMs (SIM1, SIM2 and SIM3) <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Although TRIM5&#x003b1; was recently found to be SUMOylated <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, the contribution of SUMO to TRIM5&#x003b1; functions has been controversial.</p><p>Nonetheless, recent publications have proposed a role for SUMO-1 in retroviral TRIM5&#x003b1;-mediated restriction [<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The predicted SUMOylated lysine present in TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> promotes AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways through modulation of the RING domain activity <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Moreover, it has been recently found that mutating the putative SIM1 and SIM2 impairs TRIM5&#x003b1;-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation and retroviral restriction, while mutating SIMs had no significant effect [<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, structural data revealed that the phenotypes of SIM1 and SIM2 mutants were probably a consequence of PRYSPRY misfolding. Indeed, these motifs appear to be buried deep inside the hydrophobic core of the PRYSPRY domain, making interactions with other proteins unlikely <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, although it cannot be excluded that contact with CA might result in structural changes that expose SIM1 and SIM2. In light of these results, we re-analyzed the PRYSPRY sequence for the presence of other possible SIMs and uncovered a novel putative SIM which we named SIM4. Unlike putative SIMs 1 and 2, SIM4 residues are present at the surface of the protein, making this motif more suitable for interaction with other proteins. Here we demonstrate the importance of this motif in HIV-1 restriction and in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1. We propose that this signaling function is achieved by mediating interactions with an unidentified SUMOylated protein.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Identification of a new putative SUMO interacting motif in TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub></title><p>New insights into TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> PRYSPRY structure suggested that the previously proposed SIMs 1 and 2 were located inside the hydrophobic core of this domain, implying that direct interactions with SUMO (or any other protein) were unlikely <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Analysis of the TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> PRYSPRY domain using a SUMO-binding motif prediction software (GPS-SUMO <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>) yielded several putative SUMO interacting motifs with different scores (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). SIM1 (<sup>376</sup>ILGV<sup>379</sup>), SIM2 (<sup>405</sup>VIGL<sup>408</sup>) and SIM3 (<sup>430</sup>IVPL<sup>433</sup>) were confirmed as possible SIMs for TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub>, but the analysis revealed the presence of another putative SIM (<sup>435</sup>VIIC<sup>438</sup>) which we named SIM4. Unlike SIM1 and SIM2, SIM4 residues are mostly exposed at the surface of the protein, next to SIM3 and within the variable region 3 (V3) (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, C). The side chain of Val435 is not oriented toward the solvent, but the variable regions are present as flexible loops, and thus this residue is potentially available for protein-protein interactions.</p><p>To investigate the potential role of SIM4 in TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh-</sub>mediated HIV-1 restriction, the two first aminoacids were mutated to lysines, thus mimicking the mutations that had been introduced in the other putative SIMs (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D). The mutants of putative SIMs 1 and 3 described by others [<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] were also included in this study, while SIM2 was not included since its phenotype was identical to that of SIM1 [<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><label>2.2</label><title>V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> does not bind HIV-1CA and does not restrict HIV-1</title><p>To analyze the ability of SIM4-mutated TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> to restrict HIV-1, CRFK cells stably expressing WT, SIM1 mutant I376K-L377K, SIM2 mutant I430K-V431K or SIM4 mutant V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> were challenged with increasing amounts of VSV G-pseudotyped HIV-1-GFP. Cells transduced with the empty vector were used as a non-restrictive control. As expected [<xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], both WT and I430K-V431K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> strongly restricted HIV-1, by up to &#x0223c;100-fold, while cells expressing I376K-L377K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> were about as much permissive to HIV-1 infection as cells expressing the empty vector (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Expression of V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> resulted in a very small decrease in HIV-1 permissiveness (less than 2-fold), showing that the ability of this TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> mutant to restrict HIV-1 was almost completely lost (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). Levels of protein expression were similar for all mutants, except for I376K-L377K whose expression level was decreased (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B), as previously seen by others [<xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, the V435K-I436K mutation affects restriction of incoming HIV-1 seemingly without altering protein levels, unlike I376K-L377K which reduces both.</p><p>We investigated the ability of WT and V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> to physically interact with HIV-1CA-NC complexes in a CA-binding assay <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Briefly, purified and assembled HIV-1CA-NC complexes were mixed with TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> proteins, which were over-expressed in and isolated from HEK293T cells. The mixture was then applied to a 70% sucrose cushion and following centrifugation, pellets and supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting. In this assay, binding of TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> to HIV-1CA is evidenced when both are present in the pellet fraction. This analysis had previously been conducted for I376K-L377K and I430K-V431K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub>, and results obtained were consistent with their restriction phenotype since I430K-V431K was found to bind HIV-1CA-NC complexes while I376K-L377K did not <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Similarly to I376K-L377K, V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> failed to bind HIV-1CA-NC complexes (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C), hence explaining its inability to restrict this virus.</p><p>HIV-1 restriction by TRIM5&#x003b1; correlates with co-localization of both proteins following infection, suggesting the existence of a &#x0201c;sequestration&#x0201d; mechanism of restriction <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. To investigate TRIM5&#x003b1;-CA interactions in a cellular context, we assessed the co-localization of FLAG-tagged WT, I376K-L377K or V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> with incoming HIV-1CA. Cells were infected with VSV G-pseudotyped HIV-1-GFP for 2 h and then stained with antibodies against FLAG and CA. MG132 was used as a proteasome inhibitor to prevent the degradation of TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub>
<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D shows representative photographs; in this assay, CA foci observed likely are single viruses <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, but the assay does not distinguish between fused and unfused particles. WT, I376K-L377K and V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> were all able to form cytoplasmic bodies (CBs). Ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) treatment was used as a no-entry control as it inhibits the acidification of endosomes <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, thus preventing the release of VSV G-pseudotyped viruses in the cytoplasm and making TRIM5&#x003b1;-CA co-localization improbable. CA foci were bigger when cells were treated with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D), probably a consequence of CA accumulation in endosomes. As expected <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, a significant fraction (14%) of HIV-1CA foci co-localized with WT TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> CBs (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D). In contrast, I376K-L377K and V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> showed very little co-localization with HIV-1CA (0.6% and 0.7%, respectively). CA-TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> co-localization dropped to 0.1% when cells were treated with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, suggesting that the co-localization events observed in absence of this drug were specific and involved post-entry virus cores. Taken together, these results show that mutating SIM4 can disrupt physical interactions of TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> with its viral CA target, hence impairing restriction.</p></sec><sec id="sec0025"><label>2.3</label><title>V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> is stable and able to shuttle to the nucleus</title><p>As shown in <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B, I376K-L377K but not V435K-I436K altered steady-state levels of TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub>, suggesting that protein folding was affected by the former but not the latter mutation. To further investigate protein stability, CRFK cells stably expressing WT, I376K-L377K, I430K-V431K or V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> were treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) and reduction in protein levels was then monitored over time by Western blotting coupled with densitometry analysis.

CRFK cells stably expressing WT or V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> were lysed and the lysates were treated with increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde, a crosslinking agent previously used in similar experiments [<xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].

The TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> RING domain mutant C35A, which has no ubiquitin ligase activity and is unable to activate NF-&#x003ba;B, was used as a negative control <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

Interestingly, V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> did not induce significant NF-&#x003ba;B activation since levels of luciferase expression were similar to those of the C35A control and the empty vector control (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). Levels of luciferase expression in cells transfected with 3 &#x003bc;g of I376K-L377K and V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> were significantly decreased compared to cells transfected with the WT plasmid (&#x0223c;65-fold for I376K-L377K and &#x0223c;11-fold for V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub>; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Levels of TRIM5&#x003b1; expression were similar for the WT and the various mutants, with the exception of I376K-L377K which showed reduced expression levels (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). Therefore, the inability of V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> to activate NF-&#x003ba;B was not caused by decreased expression levels. On the other hand, I376K-L377K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> low expression levels partly explain the very low levels of NF-&#x003ba;B induction for this mutant (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A).

On the other hand, I376K-L377K and V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> were very weak activators of AP-1, as evidenced by low luciferase signal in both cases. Specifically, when 3 &#x003bc;g of the TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub>-expressing plasmid were used, WT and I430K-V431K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> increased luciferase activity by &#x0223c;21-fold and &#x0223c;9-fold relative to the empty vector control, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) while I376K-L377K and V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> increased it by only &#x0223c;2.3-fold (<italic>P</italic> = 0.1957) and &#x0223c;2.2-fold (<italic>P</italic> = 0.2304), respectively.

Levels of protein expression were determined in the transfected cells by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D) and we found that V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> was expressed at WT-like levels while I430K-V431K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> was expressed at smaller levels (a 2- to 3-fold decrease). This explains that in the experiment shown in <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C, AP-1 activation by I430K-V431K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> is similarly less efficient than for the WT control. On the other hand, the inability of I376K-L377K and V435K-I436K to activate AP-1 does not result from poor expression levels in HEK293T cells.

As expected, K63-linked ubiquitin chains were almost undetectable in cells transfected with this mutant (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). Co-transfection of WT, I376K-L377K, I430K-V431K and V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> with WT ubiquitin resulted in strong stimulation of K63-linked polyubiquitylation, compared to cells co-transfected with TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> and KO ubiquitin or compared to cells co-transfected with the empty vector and WT ubiquitin (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A, B). A densitometry-based quantitative analysis was performed using Western blots from 3 independent experiments (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Values were obtained by normalizing relative K63-linked ubiquitin chains densities from the indicated TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> to the one obtained with the empty vector control (CTL) when co-transfected with WT ubiquitin.

To test this possibility, IF microscopy was performed on CRFK cells stably expressing WT or V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> and in the presence or absence of LMB.

For this purpose, we aligned the <italic>TRIM5&#x003b1;</italic> coding sequence from 36 primate species. The relationship between these species is shown in <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. None of the New World monkeys (NWM) or the prosimians encode an intact VIIC motif. On the other hand, all representatives of the great apes (human, chimpanzee, West African chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Sumatran orangutan and Bornean orangutan) and a majority of the Old World monkeys (OWM) have conserved SIM4 VIIC motifs. Based on these observations, we propose that SIM4 VIIC did not appear independently in these two groups but, instead, arose before the split of Old World monkeys and hominoids which occurred approximately 29 million years ago. Within the OWM and hominoids lineages, SIM4 has been mutated at 5 independent times throughout evolution (stars on branches in <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Analysis of TRIM5&#x003b1; exon 8 sequences from 34 individual crab-eating macaques was done using <italic>BLAST</italic> and revealed 2 individuals from the Mauritian population which encode VIVC.

These data demonstrate that SIM4 is quite variable both between and within primate species.</p><p>All natural SIM4 variants were tested for their ability to activate NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1 and restrict HIV-1. Using mutagenesis, we substituted TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub>-SIM4 (VIIC) with all the natural variants (VKIC, VNIC, VTIC, VIVC, VIFC and MTIC), resulting in the production of 6 new proteins. First, their capacity to activate the NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 signaling pathways was tested, as described above, using co-transfections in HEK293T cells. All the SIM4 variants were able to activate NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>A) and AP-1 (<xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>B) since significant luciferase activity was observed in both experiments. The SIM4 variants seemed to show some level of reduction (&#x0223c;15% to 60%) in their capacity to activate both pathways, compared to the WT, but this could largely be attributed to decreased expression levels (<xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>C, D). In contrast, V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> was unable to activate both signaling pathways, as expected.

CRFK cells stably expressing all the SIM4 variants, V435K-I436K or WT TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> were challenged with increasing amounts of HIV-1-GFP and further analyzed by flow cytometry. As expected, WT TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> strongly inhibited HIV-1 (<xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>E) and V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> failed to restrict HIV-1 and was only slightly less permissive than cells expressing the empty vector control. All the SIM4 variants restricted HIV-1 at an intermediate level: &#x0223c;8-fold less than WT and &#x0223c;6-fold more than the empty vector control, on average. Levels of protein expression were determined by Western blotting and were found to be comparable in all transduced cells (<xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>E). An upper unspecific band was detected by the anti-FLAG antibody, as previously observed in CRFK cells (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). Thus, mutating VIIC into naturally occurring sequences found in other species affects TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> ability to optimally restrict HIV-1, consistent with this motif being involved in interactions with CA in addition to being important for NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1 signaling. The fact that, for some of the mutants tested, the effect on NF-&#x003ba;B activation is much milder than the effect on restriction supports a model in which the two functions can have distinct determinants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0050"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we identified a new putative SIM (<sup>435</sup>VIIC<sup>438</sup>) in TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> PRYSPRY that is, on one hand, involved in specific interactions with the retroviral capsid, and on the other hand, is also essential for the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1 at least in the infection-free model employed here.

As also proposed by Brandariz-Nu&#x000f1;ez et al. <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, our results support the hypothesis that mutating the previously proposed SIM1 causes gross misfolding of the PRYSPRY domain, preventing the nuclear translocation of TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and resulting in its proteasomal degradation (Nepveu-Traversy and Berthoux, unpublished data).

However, V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> shows increased potential for multimerization and CB formation (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The TRIM5&#x003b1; coiled-coil and Linker2 domains upstream of SPRY form an anti-parallel homodimer which is expected to bring the SPRY domains in relatively close proximity [<xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and it is conceivable that mutations in the proposed SIM4 could modulate interactions between the two PRYSPRY domains with negative consequences on restriction. In addition, it is possible that the larger size of the SIM4-mutated TRIM5&#x003b1; CBs means that less TRIM5&#x003b1; is available to intercept incoming HIV-1, contributing to the loss of restriction.</p><p>The CA protein of the N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV), which is restricted by human TRIM5&#x003b1; (TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Hu</sub>) <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> is likely modified by SUMO-1 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. It has been proposed that TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Hu</sub> restricts N-MLV efficiently through the binding of TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Hu</sub> SIM1 and/or SIM2 to the incoming SUMOylated N-MLV CA <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Recent structural data suggesting that SIM1 and SIM2 are internal motifs <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> seem to invalidate this theory, although other structural data indicate that the PRYSPRY domain can adopt several conformations <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> and that the variable loops at its surface probably undergo conformational changes upon binding to CA <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, opening the possibility that SIM1 or SIM2 could be brought at the surface of the protein upon CA interactions. This, however, does not appear to be a likely possibility. The putative SIM identified here, SIM4, is clearly a surface motif and thus could potentially bind a SUMOylated CA. However, HIV-1CA has not been found to be SUMOylated, and in addition, the evidence linking SUMO to direct restriction of incoming retroviruses is not overwhelming. Arriagada and colleagues showed that over-expression of SUMO-1 in 293T cells restricts N-MLV and only in conditions in which this virus is also restricted by TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Hu</sub>
<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, suggesting that SUMO is a co-factor for TRIM5&#x003b1;. However, over-expression of SUMO-1 had much smaller effects on the permissiveness of other human cell lines to N-MLV infection, and a follow-up study focusing this time on TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> did not show that over-expression of SUMO-1 inhibited HIV-1 in restrictive conditions <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Instead, the authors reported that SUMO-1 depletion canceled HIV-1 restriction by TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub>, but this conclusion was weakened by inefficient SUMO-1 knockdown and abnormally low levels of HIV-1 restriction by TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> in the control cells <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Similarly, another recent study reported a reduction in restriction by transfection of siRNAs targeting SUMO-1, Ubc9 or PIAS1 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, restriction of HIV-1 by TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> in this transient transfection-based setting was similarly much weaker than in stably transduced cells (less than 4-fold compared to the usual &#x0223c;100-fold). A more recent study reported that perturbing the SUMOylation pathway by over-expression of Gam1 [<xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] had no impact on the restriction of N-MLV in human cells <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, and we found that Gam1 does not influence the restriction of HIV-1 by TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> expressed in human cells (Nepveu-Traversy and Berthoux, unpublished data). Thus, there is altogether neither strong nor even consensual evidence that the SUMOylation pathway is important for the direct restriction of incoming retroviruses, especially for HIV-1. On the other hand, the presence of a conserved putative SUMOylation site and of SIMs indicates a role for SUMO in TRIM5&#x003b1; functions, and we propose that SUMO and the SUMOylation pathway are involved in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1 by TRIM5&#x003b1;. Recently, we have shown that mutating the putatively SUMOylated lysine (lysine 10) reduces the capacity of TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> to generate K63-linked polyubiquitin and to activate NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Here we show that the SIM4 double substitution mutant V435K-I436K completely disrupts the NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1 activation potential of TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub>, while mutating SIM3 has no effect (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>It has been previously suggested that activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 by TRIM5&#x003b1; is the consequence of a signaling cascade that includes the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains. Similarly to TRAF6, a RING domain protein, TRIM5&#x003b1; recruits a E2 heterodimer, Ubc13/Ube2V2 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, to catalyze the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> which are important for the activation of TAK1 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, a key factor for the downstream activation of both NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Interestingly, all the PRYSPRY mutants tested in this study were able to trigger significant formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This result suggests that the various putative SIMs, and probably the PRYSPRY domain itself, are irrelevant to this function, at least in this over-expression experimental model. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that the SIM1 mutant can promote K63-linked ubiquitin despite its PRYSPRY domain being possibly misfolded. In contrast, mutating the RING zinc finger abolished this function (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), confirming that this domain is an essential determinant for the generation of K63-linked ubiquitin by TRIM5&#x003b1; <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Moreover, the fact that mutations in the putative SIM1 and SIM4 motifs abolish the stimulation of NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 indicates that presence of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains is not the sole requirement for activation of these innate immunity pathways. Thus, the SIM4 (<sup>435</sup>VIIC<sup>438</sup>) motif seems to be a determinant for an as yet unidentified activation step that is required for activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 pathways. We cannot exclude, however, that the K63-linked ubiquitin chains generated by V435K-I436K TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> are defective in a way that could not be revealed by our Western blot analysis, or that they are not properly located in the cell to activate the NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 pathways. A direct role for SIM4 in activating NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 appears more likely, however, and we propose that SIM4 interacts with SUMO or an unidentified SUMOylated protein and that this interaction contributes to the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1. The existence of such interactions was suggested by IF microscopy results (<xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>The exact nature of the involvement of SUMO and the SUMOylation pathway in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1 by TRIM5&#x003b1; remains an open question. TAK-1 binding protein 2 (TAB2) was recently proposed to be SUMOylated, and mutating its SUMOylated lysine enhanced the activity of TAB2 and resulted in increased AP-1 activation <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Also, NF-&#x003ba;B essential modulator (NEMO/IKK&#x003b3;) is SUMOylated in response to various stress signals, allowing NF-&#x003ba;B activation by translocation of SUMOylated NEMO to the nucleus <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. On the other hand, the inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;), which hides the nuclear localization signal, is degraded by the proteasome to allow translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B to the nucleus, but SUMOylation stabilizes it and consequently inhibits NF-&#x003ba;B activation <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Taken together, these findings show that activation of NF-&#x003ba;B is extensively controlled by SUMOylation, providing several speculative models for TRIM5&#x003b1; interacting with a SUMOylated factor in order to promote innate immune activation. For instance, TRIM5&#x003b1; could interact, through the SIM4 motif, with SUMOylated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; to disrupt its interaction with NF-&#x003ba;B and thus promote NF-&#x003ba;B translocation to the nucleus. It is possible that the shuttling of TRIM5&#x003b1; in the nucleus and its transient association with PML bodies are important in its capacity to activate NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1.</p><p>A phylogenetic analysis of the proposed SIM4 revealed some significant changes in some of the 36 primates analyzed (<xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Six naturally occurring variants were tested for their ability to restrict HIV-1 when placed in a TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> context and all were less efficient than their WT counterpart in this assay (<xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>E), confirming that this motif is important for CA interactions in addition to being important for the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1. Interestingly, intra-species polymorphism was found at this position in rhesus and crab-eating macaques. The analysis of NCBI TRIM5&#x003b1; sequences from 34 crab-eating macaques revealed 2 isolates bearing the motif VIVC, and 1 of 15 rhesus macaques had the motif VTIC. These species are already known for their polymorphism due to the occasional presence of a supplementary allele coding for TRIMCyp [<xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Interestingly, individuals expressing the modified SIM4 (VIVC and VTIC) did not have the additional TRIMCyp allele. It is possible that TRIMCyp and SIM4 variants emerged in response to different viruses. The high level of polymorphism in SIM4 also supports a role for this motif in interacting with incoming retroviral CA cores. Of note, the VIIC motif is found in great apes and in OWM, the two primate groups living in Africa where one finds the most cases of SIV infections. It is possible that primates in other parts of the world do not undergo a strong selective pressure in order to make TRIM5&#x003b1; ultra-responsive towards lentiviruses. Interestingly, the ability to activate NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 was maintained for the six naturally occurring SIM4 variants tested here (<xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), suggesting that this function is essential and is evolutionarily conserved despite variations in the sequence that affect the capacity of these variants to restrict HIV-1 (<xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This observation supports the idea that the two functions are not necessarily coupled, even though interaction of TRIM5&#x003b1; with restriction sensitive viruses was shown to activate NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we have characterized a new putative SIM (<sup>435</sup>VIIC<sup>438</sup>) in TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> that is important for TRIM5&#x003b1;-dependent innate immune signaling, possibly through its capacity to interact with SUMO or a SUMOylated protein, and which also has a role in the retroviral tropism of TRIM5&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec id="sec0055"><label>4</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec0060"><label>4.1</label><title>Plasmid DNAs and mutagenesis</title><p>pMIP-TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> expresses a C-terminal FLAG-tagged version of TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Rh</sub> and has been described before [<xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].
