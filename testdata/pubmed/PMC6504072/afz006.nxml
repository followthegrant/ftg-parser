</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="afz006s6"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in older adults and is an established risk factor for mortality and cardiovascular events [<xref rid="afz006C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) described the grading system used internationally for CKD, with Grade 3 representing moderate impairment, Grade 4 severe impairment and Grade 5 kidney failure [<xref rid="afz006C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Global estimates of CKD3&#x02013;5 prevalence for adults over 70 years range from 14.1% in the Netherlands to 56.6% in Ireland, higher in women [<xref rid="afz006C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="afz006C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CKD and hypertension frequently co-exist and independently increase the risk of cardiovascular outcomes [<xref rid="afz006C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="afz006C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="afz006C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Blood pressure (BP) management is a key aspect of CKD clinical care. However, studies incorporated into guidelines on BP in CKD largely exclude adults older than 70 years [<xref rid="afz006C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], despite comprising over half of the CKD population [<xref rid="afz006C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Debate continues about safe levels of BP reduction in older adults. Until recently, the consensus internationally for older adults with CKD without diabetes or significant proteinuria was to control BP to a target of &#x0003c;140/90 mmHg [<xref rid="afz006C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="afz006C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="afz006C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. CKD guidelines do not specifically recommend adjustments for BP management in older adults. The recently published American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelines [<xref rid="afz006C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] suggest a &#x02018;team-based approach to risk/benefit&#x02019; in older adults, but currently BP-associated prognosis in older adults with moderate to severe CKD is not known [<xref rid="afz006C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Weiss <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="afz006C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] investigated Systolic BP (SBP) and mortality in older adults with CKD and found that the relationship varied with age: a U-shaped mortality curve at age 65&#x02013;70, but no increased mortality in adults aged over 70 years at SBP &#x0003e;140 mmHg, compared to 131&#x02013;140 mmHg, and higher mortality at SBP &#x0003c;130 mmHg. However, the study did not report cardiovascular outcomes or allow for BP dynamics. We have recently shown BPs decline from 14 to 18 years prior to death [<xref rid="afz006C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], potentially biasing observational studies by confusing cause and effect.</p><p>The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) [<xref rid="afz006C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] enrolled adults with high cardiovascular risks taking antihypertensive medication with SBP between 130 and 139 mmHg, and studied the effect of reducing SBP to a target of &#x0003c;120 mmHg. In a predefined CKD sub-analysis (mean age 71.9 with 43.9% aged &#x02265;75), the composite cardiovascular trended lower in the intervention group, but did not reach significance (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63&#x02013;1.05), and intervention group overall mortality outcome was lower (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53&#x02013;0.99). Importantly, there was no evidence of effect modification comparing those with and without CKD. Although the SPRINT trial clearly provides more robust evidence than observational studies, it does have limitations: e.g. those with cognitive impairment, unable to stand or in a nursing home were excluded; CKD in SPRINT was relatively mild Grade 3 CKD with a mean estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of 47.4 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; 11% withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up, and separate results for the 75 plus group were not reported. Also, the trial was stopped after a 3.3 years median follow-up due to evidence of overall benefit across the intervention group, with ascertainment of longer-term outcomes therefore necessarily remaining unmeasured.</p><p>In this observational analysis, we aimed to estimate mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in a representative, population-based cohort aged over 60 years (for comparison with existing studies), with CKD3 and 4, according to SBP, followed for up to 10 years. We used large-scale data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) of primary care medical records. CPRD includes routine clinical measurements of creatinine and BP linked to clinical records. CKD3 and 4 were the focus population of this study to encompass older adults with clinically significant renal impairment but predominantly cared for in primary care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="afz006s7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="afz006s8"><title>Data source</title><p>We used data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), which provides anonymised primary care data for over 11.3 million patients from 674 UK community practices for health research [<xref rid="afz006C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The CPRD is linked to hospital episode statistics (HES) and death certification. Ethical approval was granted by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee for UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency database research (ISAC) under protocol number 14_135 and 14_135RA. The CPRD is shown to be representative of the UK population for age, sex and ethnicity [<xref rid="afz006C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and to have good external validity for CKD [<xref rid="afz006C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="afz006C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The CPRD obtained Multiple Research Ethics Committee approval (05/MRE04/87) to undertake purely observational studies. CPRD is also covered by NIGB-ECC approval ECC 5&#x02013;05 (a) 2012.</p></sec><sec id="afz006s9"><title>Sample selection</title><p>Adults aged over 60 years were included, with age categories 60&#x02013;70 years, for comparison with previous studies, and over 70 years. The index date was the date when all selection criteria were met, between 1 January 2000 and 14 November 2014.</p><p>We focussed on CKD3 and 4, excluding CKD 5 (eGFR &#x0003c;15 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) who have a different risk profile [<xref rid="afz006C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="afz006C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and are largely managed in secondary care. We excluded previous renal transplant and polycystic kidney disease due to mechanisms that may alter relationship with BP. We excluded pre-existing diabetes, as defined by the Quality and Outcomes Framework business rules at index date [<xref rid="afz006C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] which are used to identify adults within primary care with clinically diagnosed diabetes. We also excluded significant proteinuria (&#x0003e;30 mg/mmol Albumin Creatinine Ratio or equivalent in recorded laboratory values or medical read codes for proteinuria), as these groups have different risk profiles and are subject to different clinical guidelines. In order to minimise reverse causation, we excluded prevalent heart failure, dementia, cancer and those within 6 months of death, who would have increased mortality and potentially declining BP trends.</p></sec><sec id="afz006s10"><title>CKD and blood pressure measures</title><p>The eGFR was calculated from creatinine, based on the CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation [<xref rid="afz006C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], shown to be valid in older adults [<xref rid="afz006C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The CKD category was derived from eGFR according to KDIGO definitions [<xref rid="afz006C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Two eGFR measurements in the same CKD category were required over 90 days apart, as per clinical guidelines [<xref rid="afz006C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], within 3 years prior to index date.</p><p>BP values were from routine clinical measurements. To minimise potential bias due to atypical values obtained during acute illness, we used median BP from the 3 years prior to index date. The main analysis focuses on those without declining BP in the 5 years prior to index date, as we previously described declining BP trajectories over 10 years prior to death [<xref rid="afz006C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="afz006s11"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Follow-up was for a maximum of 10 years, until death or study end date of 14 November 2014.</p><p>The outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality and incident cardiovascular disease: ischaemic stroke (stroke), myocardial infarction or cardiac revascularisation procedure (MIP) and heart failure. All-cause mortality was established from HES codes and office of national statistics (ONS).</p><p>Incident cases of stroke, MIP, and heart failure were established from HES and primary care Read Codes specific to the conditions. We used HES for stroke outcomes to increase specificity for ischaemic stroke [<xref rid="afz006C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, for MIP we used the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures version 4 (OPCS) [<xref rid="afz006C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to increase yield of clinically significant coronary artery disease by including coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass graft procedures.</p></sec><sec id="afz006s12"><title>Covariates</title><p>Sex, age, year of index date (for clinical practice changes), social deprivation status, smoking status, BMI category and alcohol status were adjusted for in the main study models (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Appendix 1, available at <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online</xref>). These covariates were adjusted for in mortality and cardiovascular analyses.</p></sec><sec id="afz006s13"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>We investigated the effect of diastolic BP on outcomes separately, with the same adjustments and methods as for SBP. We conducted overall subgroup analyses by sex and for those with declining BPs. To address possible reverse causation, for example from clinically undiagnosed heart failure, we performed a sensitivity analysis censoring the first 5 years of follow-up, which also provided information about longer-term outcomes given that existing studies have been largely restricted to &#x0003c;4 years [<xref rid="afz006C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="afz006C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis stratifying by Charlson co-morbidity index to check whether results were different according to co-morbid status [<xref rid="afz006C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="afz006s14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Stata v14.1.</p><p>We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations between CKD grade, baseline SBP and all-cause mortality and Fine and Gray competing risk models [<xref rid="afz006C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] for cardiovascular outcomes, with all-cause mortality as the competing risk.</p><p>Analyses were stratified according to age group (60&#x02013;70 and 70+) and CKD stage (3 or 4). The comparison group was attained SBP 130&#x02013;139 mmHg, in keeping with current international guidelines [<xref rid="afz006C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="afz006C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="afz006C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="afz006s15"><title>Missing data</title><p>Clinical information within the study was felt likely to be missing not at random. Cohort selection was determined by laboratory identification of CKD and BPs collected by routine clinical measurements. Therefore, those with less healthcare seeking behaviour may be under-represented in this study. However, in the UK over 98% of the population are registered with a primary healthcare provider and consultations are free of charge [<xref rid="afz006C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Loss to follow-up in this routinely collected dataset is possible for those who transfer out of the CPRD participating practices prior to the end of follow-up or death, but mortality outcomes were obtained from national health certification and so are near complete. Loss to follow-up other than mortality can occur on change of practice and therefore is likely to be a combination of those who move into a formal care setting outside their previous area and those who are healthy and relocate. Those transferred out of the practice were censored.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="afz006s16"><title>Results</title><p>About 165,324 subjects met inclusion criteria for this analysis, 158,713 (96%) with CKD3 and 6,611 with CKD4.

In this large-scale study of older primary care patients with CKD3 and 4 (but free of diabetes or proteinuria), we found that in subjects aged 70+, routine clinical SBPs 140&#x02013;169 mmHg were not associated with excess mortality or incident cardiovascular morbidity, compared to achieving SBPs of 130&#x02013;140 mmHg.

Our mortality results are consistent with this analysis, which found that all-cause mortality was elevated with SBP &#x0003e;140 mmHg for adults 65&#x02013;70, but in adults over 70 all-cause mortality was no different with SBP &#x0003e;140 mmHg compared to the reference group. Our study is a major extension of this work. Weiss <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="afz006C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] did not evaluate cardiovascular outcomes and included some conditions at baseline that may cause reverse causation, such as diabetes. However, they report a sensitivity analysis excluding heart failure produced similar results.</p><p>We described the SPRINT randomised trial [<xref rid="afz006C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] CKD sub-study in our introduction. Randomised trails provide robust evidence on treatment effects and cannot be directly compared to our observational results which focus on prognosis. The SPRINT CKD recruited patient group differed from the group we studied: for example, the all-cause death rate in the SPRINT CKD sub-study control group (mean age 71) was 2.21% per year, but in our sample (mean age 76) the death rate was 5.38% per year (95%CI 5.34%&#x02013;5.42%, <italic>n</italic> = 50,715/165,324 over 5.7 year mean follow-up, 5.2% in CKD3, 10.2% in CKD4). The results of SPRINT are clearly more robust than observational studies, but questions do remain for the routine long-term care of the full range of typical older groups managed in primary care, who often continue with antihypertensive medications for many years. As our subjects represent whole older populations (virtually all older people are registered with primary care, including those with cognitive impairments and in institutional settings) with practically complete follow-up through the national hospital and death certification systems, our estimates of prognosis may be informative for developing treatment approaches for the wider older population.</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis by Malhotra <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="afz006C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] investigated mortality outcomes in adults with CKD3&#x02013;5 according to intensity of BP control. Included trials decreased mean SBP to 132 mmHg in the intensive arm and to 140 mmHg in the less intensive arms, with median follow-up of 3.6 years and a mean difference in SBP of 10 mmHg between the two groups. The overall odds ratio for all-cause mortality was reported as 0.86 (95% CI, 0.76&#x02013;0.97; <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) for more intensive versus less intensive BP control. While some of the included studies were focussed on older adults (e.g. the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) [<xref rid="afz006C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]), outcomes for older adults were not reported separately.</p><p>Our study has a number of key strengths. We report the results of the largest cohort study on BP that has been conducted in older adults with established CKD. A particular strength of our analysis is the representative nature of the cohort for older adults in the general population. We have included a substantial median follow-up (5.7 years, maximum 10). We have accounted for BP dynamics and shown that results are similar with stable or declining BPs, as well as for long-term and short-term follow-up.</p><p>There are inevitably limitations of our analyses. This is prospective observational analysis using existing data&#x02014;the exposure status was collected prior to the outcome data, however it was not a controlled trial and could therefore be subject to unmeasured confounding. We have adjusted for relevant measured potential confounding factors and additionally conducted sensitivity analyses. Data on proteinuria were only available for a limited proportion of those with CKD3 and 4, but those with significant proteinuria or diabetes were excluded as these groups are subject to different clinical guidelines and should be considered separately.</p><p>An important difference with trials such as SPRINT is that our BP measurements were from clinical routine data, which can provide higher BP measures than BPs taken under research conditions [<xref rid="afz006C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, in our analyses we used median BP recorded over 3-year periods prior to index date. In addition to giving stable overall estimates, 3-year mean BPs should have removed the effects of atypical values for each patient, for example those obtained during acute illness. Finally, the BP measures were those that family physicians were using to guide clinical decisions, and therefore have validity in estimating prognosis in typical care settings. Our results that, e.g. we observed no increase mortality in the 70 plus group with SBPs from 160 to 169 mmHg (versus SBP 130&#x02013;139) appears difficult to explain away with the usually modestly lower SBPs in both the high SBP group and the comparison category that might have been measured in research settings.</p><p>The majority of the cohort had CKD3, leading to small sample sizes within SBP categories of CKD4 and wide confidence intervals. More work is required into prognosis by attained SBP in older adults with CKD3 and 4 and significant proteinuria or co-existing diabetes.</p><p>Although we have tried to minimise confounding, residual confounding is always possible in observational studies, and our results should be regarded as estimates of observed prognosis rather than necessarily being directly driven only by antihypertensive medication effects. The evidence presented, however, suggests the need for further work, preferably including randomised trials, to provide a stronger evidence base for current BP targets in older CKD patients without diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="afz006s22"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This large-scale analysis of attained SBP in a representative cohort of older adults with CKD3 and 4 provides further evidence that older adults have different prognoses from relatively younger or healthier adults. We found that SBP up to 169 mmHg were not associated with increased mortality or heart failure in adults over 70 compared with BP 130&#x02013;140 mmHg, while SBP of 120&#x02013;129 mmHg and &#x0003c;120 mmHg were associated with worse prognosis. Approaches to clinical management of SBP in older patients with CKD should not necessarily be based on extrapolating findings from younger groups. Further prospective studies, preferably including randomised trails, are required in representative older adults to establish optimum BP targets in older adults with CKD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="afz006_aa-18-0454-file002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="afy186s15"><title/><p>
