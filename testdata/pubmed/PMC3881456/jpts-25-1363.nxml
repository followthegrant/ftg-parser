uptake kinetics in assessment of the ability of skeletal muscles to utilize oxygen.
[Subjects] We evaluated 12 young, healthy males. [Methods] The subjects completed a series
of tests to determine their peak oxygen uptake, pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics at the
onset of moderate-intensity treadmill exercise, and the rate of decline in
electromyographic (EMG) mean power frequency (MPF) (EMG MPF<sub>rate</sub>) during one
continuous, fatiguing, isometric muscle action of the plantar flexors until exhaustion at
approximately 60% maximum voluntary contraction. We discussed the relationships between
pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics and EMG MPF<sub>rate</sub> reflecting the ability of
skeletal muscles to utilize oxygen and between pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics and peak
oxygen uptake reflecting the ability to deliver oxygen to skeletal muscles. We
hypothesized that pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics may be more highly correlated with EMG
MPF<sub>rate</sub> than peak oxygen uptake. [Results] Pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics
(33.9 &#x000b1; 5.9&#x02005;s) were more significantly correlated with peak oxygen uptake (50.6 &#x000b1;
5.5&#x02005;mL/kg/min) than EMG MPF<sub>rate</sub> (&#x02212;14.7 &#x000b1; 8.7%/s). [Conclusion] Pulmonary oxygen
uptake kinetics is a noninvasive index that is mainly usable for evaluation of the ability
of cardiovascular system to deliver oxygen to skeletal muscles in healthy young adults
with slower pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics (&#x0003e;20&#x02005;s).</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics</kwd><kwd>Oxygen utilization capacity</kwd><kwd>Oxygen delivery capacity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In patients with cardiac disease, it is becoming increasingly clear that peripheral
(skeletal muscle) factors, in addition to central (cardiac) factors, play an important role
in the determination of exercise tolerance, clinical status, and quality of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, cardiac rehabilitation programs
have focused on skeletal muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is clinically important to evaluate
oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscles and establish a conventional index that can be
widely used in routine clinical practice. This approach should interest clinicians who need
noninvasive tools, allowing quantitative and longitudinal evaluation of metabolic
impairment, which can be used for patient follow-up and assessment of therapies or other
interventions.</p><p>At exercise onset, the fundamental adjustment of pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>)
kinetics during moderate-intensity exercise [i.e., exercise performed below the intensity
corresponding to the anaerobic threshold (AT)] may be considered to represent a functional
evaluation tool of oxidative metabolism at the skeletal muscle level. The rate of this
adjustment, given by the VO<sub>2</sub> time constant (&#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub>), provides a useful
insight into the integrated functioning of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and muscular
systems. Aerobic fitness may be defined as the ability to deliver O<sub>2</sub> to skeletal
muscles and utilize it to generate energy during exercise. In healthy individuals, it is
largely accepted that &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> is determined by sluggish activation of enzymes and
provision of substrates for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (i.e., oxidative inertia
hypothesis and O<sub>2</sub> utilization limitation hypothesis)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, but it may be constrained by the rate of O<sub>2</sub> delivery to
active muscle fibers (i.e., O<sub>2</sub> delivery limitation hypothesis)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Doria et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. recently reported that an
improvement in &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> is highly correlated with percent increase in mitochondrial
protein following exercise training, but this occurs without improvement in the dynamics of
O<sub>2</sub> delivery. This investigation indicates that &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> may be an
evaluation index capable of reflecting the ability of skeletal muscle to utilize
O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>However, further investigation relevant to the relationship between &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> and
skeletal muscle fatigue resistance is required. Skeletal muscle fatigue resistance was
evaluated by the rate of decline in electromyographic (EMG) mean power frequency (MPF) (EMG
MPF<sub>rate</sub>) as an index for evaluating muscle fatigue during sustained isometric
muscle actions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies have suggested that when fatiguing isometric
contractions are performed at low levels [&#x0003c;30% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)],
fatigue assessed by EMG changes is primarily due to neural changes, whereas at higher levels
(&#x0003e;45% MVC), fatigue is primarily caused by metabolic factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. EMG
MPF<sub>rate</sub>, measured at higher contraction levels, is an evaluation index
reflecting the ability of skeletal muscle to utilize O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>In this report, we discussed the relationships of &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> with skeletal muscle
fatigue resistance (EMG MPF<sub>rate</sub>) and peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) in
healthy young adults, which reflect the ability to deliver O<sub>2</sub> to skeletal
muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and determined the validation
of &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> in assessing the ability of skeletal muscle to utilize O<sub>2</sub>. We
hypothesized that &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> may be more highly correlated with EMG MPF<sub>rate</sub>
than VO<sub>2peak</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>In this study, 12 healthy male subjects volunteered and gave written consent to
participate. The ages, heights, masses, and body fat percentages of the subjects (mean &#x000b1;
SD) were 20 &#x000b1; 1.7&#x02005;years, 1.70 &#x000b1; 0.05 m, 62.2 &#x000b1; 7.0&#x02005;kg, and 21.6 &#x000b1; 2.1%, respectively. All
procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of Seirei Christopher University
(approval No. 09007). All participants were recreationally active and nonsmokers. No
participant was taking medications that would affect the cardiorespiratory response to
exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants visited the laboratory for physiological testing on four occasions within a
10-day period. To allow adequate recovery and minimize circadian/diurnal variations, each
test was separated by at least 48&#x02005;h and was performed at approximately the same time of
the day. On day one, a maximal treadmill ramp test (0% grade; 1&#x02005;km/h/min) was performed
(AR-200, Minato Medical Science Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) to determine VO<sub>2peak</sub>
and AT. VO<sub>2peak</sub> was arbitrarily defined as the highest VO<sub>2</sub> value
attained during two consecutive 20-s periods. AT was defined as the VO<sub>2</sub> at
which CO<sub>2</sub> production (VCO<sub>2</sub>) began to increase out of proportion in
relation to VO<sub>2</sub> with a systematic rise in the minute
ventilation-to-VO<sub>2</sub> ratio and end-tidal partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>,
whereas the minute ventilation-to-VO<sub>2</sub> ratio and end-tidal partial pressure of
CO<sub>2</sub> were stable. From the results of this ramp test, a moderate-intensity
running speed was selected to elicit a VO<sub>2</sub> equivalent to approximately 80&#x02212;90%
of the VO<sub>2</sub> at AT. In each of the subsequent two visits to the laboratory,
subjects performed two-step transitions at a moderate-intensity running speed. Exercise
was performed continuously, the duration of each step transition was 6&#x02005;min, and each
transition was preceded by a baseline of 4&#x02005;km/h/min walking that lasted for 6&#x02005;min. Changes
in the treadmill speed were initiated as a step function without warning the subjects.
During the last day of testing, MVC was determined, and one continuous, fatiguing,
isometric muscle action was performed until voluntary exhaustion at approximately 60% MVC.
All isometric ankle flexion testing was performed on the dominant leg (based on kicking
preference). The isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3, Sakai Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) was adjusted at an ankle joint angle of 15&#x000b0; of plantar flexion in the sitting
position with the hip and knee at 90&#x000b0;. Subjects performed three 5&#x02005;s MVCs, that were
interspersed with 5&#x02005;s of rest. The highest torque developed during the three attempts was
used as the individual&#x02019;s MVC. After 10&#x02005;min rest, 60% MVC was set as the marker on the
dynamometer screen, and each subject performed one continuous, fatiguing, isometric muscle
action of the plantar flexors at approximately 60% MVC until exhaustion (through visual
feedback). We defined the exhaustion level as a drop in torque greater than 50% MVC.</p><p>During all treadmill exercise sessions, pulmonary gas exchange was measured
breath-by-breath using a metabolic measurement system (A-E 300S, Minato Medical Science
Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Inspired and expired gas volumes were measured using a hot-wire
respiratory flow system. The expired fractions of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> were
analyzed using a paramagnetic O<sub>2</sub> analyzer and an infrared CO<sub>2</sub>
analyzer, respectively. The system was calibrated prior to each exercise test according to
the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The volume was calibrated before each exercise test by
manually pumping a 2-L syringe. The O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> analyzers were
calibrated by gases of known concentration before each exercise test. Breath-by-breath VE,
VO<sub>2</sub>, and VCO<sub>2</sub> were determined, and the results were stored on a
hard disk for subsequent analyses. VO<sub>2</sub> values were filtered by removing
aberrant values that were more than 4 SD of the local mean. Further, each transition value
was linearly interpolated to 1-s intervals and time aligned so that time zero represented
the onset of exercise. Each transition value was ensemble averaged to yield a single,
average response for each subject. This transition was further time averaged into 5-s bins
to provide a single time-averaged response for each subject. The on-transient response for
VO<sub>2</sub> was fitted using a mono-exponential model of the form<disp-formula>Y
<sub>(t)</sub> = Y <sub>Bsln</sub> + Amp (1&#x02212; e <sup>&#x02212;
(t&#x02212;TD)/&#x003c4;</sup>),</disp-formula>where Y (t) represents VO<sub>2</sub> at any time (t); Y
Bsln is the baseline VO<sub>2</sub> during 4 km/h/min walking; Amp is the steady-state
increase in VO<sub>2</sub> above the baseline value; &#x003c4; is the time constant defined as the
duration of time for VO<sub>2</sub> to increase to 63% of the steady-state increase; and
TD is the time delay (so that the model is not constrained to pass through the origin.)
After excluding the initial 20 s of values, while still allowing TD to vary freely (to
optimize the accuracy of parameter estimates), VO<sub>2</sub> values were modeled from 20
s to 4 min (240 s) of the step transition; this ensured that each subject had attained a
VO<sub>2</sub> steady-state, yet did not bias the model fit during the on-transient<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Model parameters were estimated by least-squares nonlinear
regression (Microsoft Office Excel 2010, Microsoft Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in which
the best fit was defined by minimization of the residual sum of squares and minimal
residual variations around the Y-axis (Y=0).</p><p>EMG (Noraxon) of the soleus was continuously recorded at a sampling frequency of 1,500&#x02005;Hz
using bipolar 34-mm diameter Ag-AgCl electrodes (Blue Sensor, Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark)
placed 2/3rd of the way along a line between the medial condyle of the femur and the
medial malleolus (according to Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive Assessment of
Muscles recommendations). Electrode sites were prepared by shaving, gently abrading, and
cleaning them with an alcohol-ether-acetone solution. Myoelectric signals were relayed
from the bipolar electrodes to a TeleMyo device (TeleMyo 2400T, Noraxon U.S.A. Inc.,
Scottsdale, AZ, USA). The raw EMG signal was rectified, band-pass-filtered and integrated
using commercially available software (MyoResearch XP, Noraxon U.S.A. Inc., Scottsdale,
AZ, USA). EMG MPF<sub>rate</sub> was then derived from the following
equation:<disp-formula>EMG MPF<sub>rate</sub> (%/s) = [(first MPF &#x02212; final MPF) /first
MDF &#x000d7; 100 (%)] /ET (s) &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>,</disp-formula>where first and final MPF
represent the mean of the first 5 s and final 5 s, respectively, during the fatigue
resistance test; ET is the endurance time until exhaustion.</p><p>All analyses were performed using a statistical software package (IBM SPSS Statistics 19,
IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics (mean &#x000b1; SD) were calculated for each
physiological measure during all tests. Quantitative variables were tested for normal
distribution by a Shapiro-Wilk test. Relationships between physiological measures were
determined using Pearson&#x02019;s product moment correlation coefficient. Significance at the
level of p&#x0003c;0.05 was used to determine the statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We found that &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> was 33.9 &#x000b1; 5.9&#x02005;s, EMG MPF<sub>rate</sub> was &#x02212;14.7 &#x000b1; 8.7%/s,

onset, the &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> measured at the alveolar level is dependent more on the ability
to deliver O<sub>2</sub> to skeletal muscles (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) than on the utilization of
O<sub>2</sub> in skeletal muscle (skeletal muscle fatigue resistance; EMG
MPF<sub>rate</sub>). Our results indicate that &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> offers promise as a
noninvasive index to mainly evaluate the ability of the cardiovascular system to deliver
O<sub>2</sub> to skeletal muscles in healthy young adults.</p><p>The present finding does not support our initial hypothesis that &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> is more
highly correlated with EMG MPF<sub>rate</sub> than VO<sub>2peak</sub> or the findings from
other studies showing no effect of O<sub>2</sub> delivery on &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This may reflect that &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> is limited because of the ability to deliver
O<sub>2</sub> to skeletal muscles; i.e., our result may support the O<sub>2</sub> delivery
limitation hypothesis.</p><p>This discrepancy may be due to the fact that the limiting factor in &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub>
(O<sub>2</sub> utilization or O<sub>2</sub> delivery limitation) has not been fully
revealed. The O<sub>2</sub> utilization limitation hypothesis was based on the
representative experiments, which showed that in older adults, but not younger adults,
&#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> during the transition from a priming bout of heavy-intensity exercise to
moderate-intensity exercise accelerated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> acceleration in
the older adults was attributed either to an attenuation of muscle perfusion or
O<sub>2</sub> delivery limitation. The finding that &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> was not affected by a
previous bout of heavy-intensity exercise in young adults agrees with earlier findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it is consistent with the suggestion that muscle blood flow and
O<sub>2</sub> delivery do not limit &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> in younger adults. However, a
consistent observation among these experiments was that &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> was significantly
faster (approximately 20&#x02212;30&#x02005;s)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>
in young adults compared with that in older adults (approximately 40&#x02212;60&#x02005;s)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus it is unclear from these experiments
whether the apparent lack of &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> acceleration during moderate-intensity exercise
in young adults compared with older adults is a consequence of age-dependent differences
between groups or physiological differences contributing to slower &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> in older
adults compared with younger adults.</p><p>Gurd et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup> recently demonstrated that
the &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> acceleration during moderate-intensity exercise after heavy-intensity
warm-up exercise was not restricted to older adults and may be related to the physiological
processes that control &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub>. In young adults exhibiting slower VO<sub>2</sub>
kinetics (&#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;30&#x02005;s), it was observed that &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> acceleration was
associated with improvement in local muscle oxygenation, whereas this was not seen in young
adults exhibiting inherently faster VO<sub>2</sub> kinetics (i.e., &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub>,
approximately 20&#x02005;s). Thus, &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> acceleration was due to, in part, an increase in
local muscle O<sub>2</sub> delivery. More recently, this observation was supported by Murias
et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reported that at the onset
of exercise, the rate of adjustment of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived muscle
deoxygenation [change in deoxyhomoglobin (HHb) concentration (&#x02206;[HHb]), or [HHb], depending
on the NIRS system used (a proxy for tissue O<sub>2</sub> extraction)] during
moderate-intensity exercise was faster than VO<sub>2</sub> without heavy-intensity warm-up
exercise, causing a period of greater reliance on O<sub>2</sub> extraction for a given
VO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, there was a transient mismatch in local muscle O<sub>2</sub>
delivery to O<sub>2</sub> utilization [represented as a transient &#x0201c;overshoot&#x0201d; in the
normalization of the &#x02206;[HHb] to VO<sub>2</sub> (&#x02206;[HHb]/VO<sub>2</sub>) ratio];
&#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> was significantly reduced, and this transient overshoot in the
&#x02206;[HHb]/VO<sub>2</sub> ratio was abolished with heavy-intensity warm-up exercise. In
addition to this experiment, Murias et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated in a group of young men that those with the highest
&#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> values presented with the largest mismatch between microvascular
O<sub>2</sub> delivery and O<sub>2</sub> utilization, which was again represented as the
highest &#x02206;[HHb]/VO<sub>2</sub> overshoot. Furthermore, no &#x02206;[HHb]/VO<sub>2</sub> overshoot was
observed when values from subjects with &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;21&#x02005;s were grouped. Most
recently, it was suggested that &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> is primarily limited by O<sub>2</sub>
provision when &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> exceeds approximately 20&#x02005;s in young, healthy men<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the above observations, it
seems that when &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e; 20&#x02005;s, &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub>, even in healthy young adults, is
primarily limited by the ability to deliver O<sub>2</sub> to skeletal muscles.</p><p>In the present study, &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> may reflect the ability to deliver O<sub>2</sub> to
skeletal muscles because this value was found to be 33.9 &#x000b1; 5.9&#x02005;s (&#x0003e;20&#x02005;s). Therefore,
&#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> was more highly correlated with VO<sub>2peak</sub> than EMG
MPF<sub>rate</sub>.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that, in healthy young adults at exercise onset,
pulmonary VO<sub>2</sub> kinetics during the transition to moderate-intensity exercise is
dependent more on the ability to deliver O<sub>2</sub> to skeletal muscles than utilization
of O<sub>2</sub> in skeletal muscle. This suggests that O<sub>2</sub> delivery could be a
possible factor regulating &#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> during the onset of moderate-intensity exercise
in young adults having slower VO<sub>2</sub> kinetics (&#x003c4;VO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;20&#x02005;s).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Georgiadou</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Adamopoulos</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Skeletal muscle abnormalities in chronic heart
