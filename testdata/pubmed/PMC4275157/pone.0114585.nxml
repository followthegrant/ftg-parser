Although miR-503 was shown to be important in tumorigenesis, its role in osteosarcoma remains unknown. In this study, we focused on the expression and mechanisms of miR-503 in osteosarcoma development. We found that miR-503 was down-regulated in osteosarcoma cell lines and primary tumor samples, and the restoration of miR-503 reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Low level of miR-503 in patients with osteosarcoma was associated with considerably shortened disease-free survival. Furthermore, bioinformatic prediction and experimental validation revealed that the anti-tumor effect of miR-503 was probably exerted through targeting and repressing of L1CAM expression. L1CAM was up-regulated in osteosarcoma cell lines and primary tumor samples and the expression level of L1CAM were negatively correlated with miR-503 levels in osteosarcoma tissues. Collectively, our data identify the important roles of miR-503 in osteosarcoma pathogenesis, indicating its potential application in cancer therapy.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province (H201308).

Osteosarcoma has a high metastatic potential and the main sites of metastases are the lungs, pleura, and the heart <xref rid="pone.0114585-Long1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Despite the current advances in therapeutic strategies combining chemotherapy, surgery, and sometimes radiotherapy, prognosis of patients with recurrent or metastatic osteosarcomas remains poor <xref rid="pone.0114585-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although recent developments in molecular mechanisms have provided insight into the molecular pathogenesis of osteosarcoma, the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying the histological heterogeneity, drug resistance, and development of metastasis have not been fully elucidated <xref rid="pone.0114585-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114585-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It is therefore of extreme significance to elucidate novel molecular targets to develop novel alternative therapeutic strategies for improving clinical outcome of patients suffering osteosarcoma.</p><p>The microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of non-coding, small (approximately 22 nucleotides in length) RNAs that play important roles in the pathogenesis of human diseases by modulating the activity of specific mRNA targets <xref rid="pone.0114585-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. MiRNAs involve in many cellular processes, such as differentiation, proliferation and apoptotic processes, which are important in the development of cancer <xref rid="pone.0114585-Namlos1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Meanwhile, accumulated evidence indicates that abnormal expressions of miRNAs correlate with a number of cancers <xref rid="pone.0114585-Karakatsanis1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. MiRNAs contribute to tumorigenesis and can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors by regulating the expressions of their target genes <xref rid="pone.0114585-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Thus, investigation of aberrant miRNA expression in osteosarcoma might lead to the discovery of novel miRNA biomarkers for osteosarcoma <xref rid="pone.0114585-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we confirmed thatmiR-503 was down-regulated in osteosarcoma. Also, overexpression of miR-503 suppressed osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, miR-503 inhibited the expression of L1CAM both at the mRNA and protein levels. In conclusion, we found that miR-503 functions as a tumor suppressor by directly targeting L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM). Thus, our findings provide significant clues regarding the role of miR-503 as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All of the patients (or patients' parents on behalf of the children) agreed to participate in the study and gave written informed consent.

In the present study, we found that miR-503 expression is down-regulated in osteosarcoma cells and tissues in comparison with paired adjacent non-tumor bone tissues. Moreover, the results of Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analyses showed that osteosarcoma patients with decreased miR-503 tended to have shorter overall and progression-free survival. In addition, we found that the ectopic expression of miR-503 suppressed the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in the osteosarcoma cell line. Furthermore, we also identified L1CAM as a novel and direct target of miR-503. Our findings suggested that miR-503 has a suppressor role in osteosarcoma tumorigenesis and cancer cell invasion.</p><p>Here, we presented the downregulation of miR-503 in osteosarcoma and suggested the anti-tumor effect of miR-503 in osteosarcoma pathogenesis. Interestingly, miR-503 expression patterns differ among human cancers. MiR-503 down-regulation was described in cervical cancer, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, central nervous system tumors, and hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas its up-regulation was shown in colon and ovarian cancers <xref rid="pone.0114585-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114585-Donadeu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These controversial results suggest that the role of miR-503 is possibly tumor specific and highly dependent on its targets in different cancers. Moreover, osteosarcoma tissues with the decreased expression of miR-503 tend to have shorter overall and progression-free survival. Overexpression of miR-503 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion; reduced cell viability in osteosarcoma cell lines. Meanwhile, down-regulation of miR-503 significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion. These results suggested that miR-503 acted as a tumor-suppressor whose downregulation may contribute to the progression and metastasis of osteosarcoma.</p><p>We further explored the possible targets of miR-503 in osteosarcoma cells. Among the candidate target genes, we focused on L1CAM because of its role as a regulator of tumor growth and angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0114585-Kiefel1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay we showed that miR-503 directly bound to the 3'-UTR of L1CAM, which contains a miR-503-binding site. Overexpression of miR-503 significantly repressed L1CAM expression at the both mRNA and protein levels. We also observed substantial up-regulation of L1CAM mRNA in osteosarcoma tissues and miR-503 levels were negatively correlated with L1CAM levels. Collectively, these results confirmed that miR-503 might function as a tumor suppressor in part by repressing L1CAM expression during the development of osteosarcoma.</p><p>L1CAM is the prototype member of the L1-family of closely related neural adhesion molecules <xref rid="pone.0114585-Schafer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. L1CAM was discovered as a cell adhesion molecule in the nervous system <xref rid="pone.0114585-Schafer2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Subsequent work in tumor biology has showed that L1CAM is overexpressed in many human cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and endometrial carcinoma, ovarian, melanoma and glioblastoma <xref rid="pone.0114585-GrageGriebenow1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114585-HeldFeindt1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. L1CAM expression is generally associated with poor prognosis, an aggressive phenotype, and advanced tumor stages <xref rid="pone.0114585-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Investigations in a variety of tumor types demonstrated that increased expression of L1CAM significantly increased the migration and proliferation capacity of cancer cells in vitro <xref rid="pone.0114585-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In addition, multiple clinical pathology studies have indicated that L1CAM might promote cancer cell invasion and metastasis <xref rid="pone.0114585-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114585-Yi1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In our study, we showed that L1CAM expression was up-regulated in osteosarcoma cells and tissues in comparison with paired adjacent non-tumor bone tissues. The expression of L1CAM was negatively correlated with miR-503 levels. Downregulation of this miR-503 in osteosarcoma may facilitate the expression of L1CAM, leading to enhanced metastasis of the cancer.</p><p>In conclusion, the results presented here demonstrated that miR-503 played critical roles in the growth and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. MiR-503 was significantly downregulated in human osteosarcoma compared to paired adjacent non-tumor tissues. Over-expression of miR-503 down-regulated the expression of L1CAM protein and mRNA simultaneously, suggesting that miR-503 functions as a tumor suppressor probably through down-regulating L1CAM in osteosarcoma. Thus, these results indicate that miR-503 functions as a tumor suppressor gene and can be used as a potential target in the gene therapy of osteosarcoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114585.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><p>
