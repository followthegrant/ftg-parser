Additionally, the recent work of Navratil et al. <xref rid="pone.0045154-Navratil1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> studied a human protein interaction network and its interactions with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula> viral proteins. In this paper, we perform <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula>-shell decomposition analysis <xref rid="pone.0045154-Seidman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045154-Kitsak1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and other techniques on these networks. In doing so, we are able to identify several interesting aspects of the behavior of the pathogens with respect to both species. First, we observe a strong power-law correlation between the average degree of certain parts of the network called shells and the average number of pathogen interactions for each node. This provides us some insight on which parts of the network are more attacked by the pathogens. We also show that the proteins most often attacked tend to lie in the higher numbered shells (i.e. more toward the &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; of the network). Next, we find that the nature of the attack of the pathogens is somewhat limited in that an important structural component - the core - of both networks is significantly under-attacked. Finally, we also present some species-specific results for the two protein networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Shells of Higher Average-Degree are Targeted by Pathogens</title><p>Here we discuss that certain portions of the protein networks known as &#x0201c;shells&#x0201d; are more heavily targeted by the pathogens. The shells are determined using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e004.jpg"/></inline-formula>-shell decomposition analysis. This procedure systematically divides the networks into sub-networks called shells (details on this procedure are in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section). We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045154-g001">Figure 1</xref> a strong power-law correlation between the average degree (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e005.jpg"/></inline-formula>) and average number of pathogen effectors per protein (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e006.jpg"/></inline-formula>) in each shell for both networks - despite being associated with species from different kingdoms (for humans, power-law regression produces <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e007.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e008.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e009.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e010.jpg"/></inline-formula>; for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e011.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e012.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e013.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e014.jpg"/></inline-formula>). For cross-validation, we also measure correlation with the Maximal Information Coefficient <xref rid="pone.0045154-Reshef1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e015.jpg"/></inline-formula>), which does not assume a linear relationship (for details see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section). Our finding suggests that pathogens seem to target proteins located in the more dense shells of the networks (shells with a higher average degree). Previous attempts to relate network measures with the behavior of the pathogens have provided only weak correlation (e.g. regression analysis correlating degree to number of pathogen interactions in the human protein networks gives <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e016.jpg"/></inline-formula> as reported by Navratil et al. - we provide a complete summary of these correlations later in the paper). With the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, Mukhtar et al. <xref rid="pone.0045154-Mukhtar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> shows that proteins of degree <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e017.jpg"/></inline-formula> or greater were often interacted more with the pathogens, but do not show a correlation - most likely because many high degree proteins in that network were not significantly affected by pathogens. This study differs from these previous attempts in that we focus on layers of the networks as opposed to individual nodes. We also note that if, based on certain observable irregularities, we dis-regard a small handful of shells in the human protein network, that the correlation significantly increases. In the human protein network, the average degree monotonically increases with the first <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e018.jpg"/></inline-formula> shells then becomes irregular. Further, the average number of pathogen interactions in each shell follows a very similar pattern - generally increasing during the first <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e019.jpg"/></inline-formula> shells before becoming irregular (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045154-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Although we are unsure why this occurs, we do note that if power-law analysis is performed on the data for the first <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e020.jpg"/></inline-formula> shells, the correlation significantly increases (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e021.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e022.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e023.jpg"/></inline-formula>, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e024.jpg"/></inline-formula> value when all shells are considered is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e025.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e026.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e027.jpg"/></inline-formula>).</p><fig id="pone-0045154-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0045154.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Average degree (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e028.jpg"/></inline-formula>) vs. average number pathogen interactions (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e029.jpg"/></inline-formula>) per node in a shell (log-log scale) with power-law fits.</title><p>The core of each network is circled.

Unfortunately, as with degree and betweenness (betweenness is defined in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section), it appears that the shell number for each node is not correlated with number of pathogen effectors. However, can we extract a rule from the data of the form &#x0201c;if node <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e031.jpg"/></inline-formula> is targeted by at least <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e032.jpg"/></inline-formula> pathogen interactions then it must have a shell number of at least <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e033.jpg"/></inline-formula>&#x0201d;? We looked at the minimum shell number targeted by a certain number of pathogen effectors (or greater) and found that such rules appear to be true for both datasets we examined. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045154-g003">Figure 3</xref> illustrates this relationship. We normalized the minimum shell-number, degree and betweenness associated with nodes being targeted by at least a certain number of pathogen interactions. It is noteworthy that the results for the human protein-interaction network, though striking, may actually be understated as the shell number (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e034.jpg"/></inline-formula>) of the core is significantly higher than the next shell (which has a shell number of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e035.jpg"/></inline-formula>).</p><fig id="pone-0045154-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0045154.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Normalized minimum centrality measure (the centrality measures depicted here are degree, betweenness, and shell number) of nodes targeted by at least a certain number of pathogen interactions.</title><p>(A) Human protein interaction network.

The core nodes (a.k.a. network nucleus), are a relatively small set of densely-connected nodes (a node in the core has many connections to other nodes in the core) that in other networks were shown to be associated with a key function of the network <xref rid="pone.0045154-Carmi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and/or are amplifying the spread of a phenomenon <xref rid="pone.0045154-Kitsak1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. An example of such a function could be the spread of information. Hence, targeting the core nodes does not seem to be part of the pathogen attack strategy in both humans and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> network, core nodes are targeted by pathogens about half as expected based on the power-law correlation. For the human, these nodes are targeted only about a quarter as expected (the core nodes are circled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045154-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Further, it appears that highly targeted nodes are not found in the core. Of the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e036.jpg"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e037.jpg"/></inline-formula>) of targeted nodes in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> network, only one of them is in the core.

In Mukhtar et al. <xref rid="pone.0045154-Mukhtar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> the authors examine nodes with a degree of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e040.jpg"/></inline-formula> or greater - a set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e041.jpg"/></inline-formula> nodes referred to as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e042.jpg"/></inline-formula> in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> network. Five of these are what those authors consider &#x0201c;highly targeted&#x0201d; and none of them are in the core. Of the remaining <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e043.jpg"/></inline-formula> nodes in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e044.jpg"/></inline-formula>, six of them are in the core.

The pathogen relies upon the host cellular machinery for replication so it impacts the genetic network involved in the immune response, pathogen infection process, and gene expression architecture to produce pathogen offspring. On the route to achieving optimal virulence, a pathogen may evolve to target the genetic circuits to allow maximum fitness of both itself and the host <xref rid="pone.0045154-Berenos1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. While some highly connected nodes of a genetic network prove to be lethal when either knocked down experimentally or perturbed by a pathogen in nature, the data analyzed herein demonstrates a plethora of viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic pathogens target well-connected, but non-core nodes in both plant and human interactome datasets. It may be that the step-wise evolution of a pathogen involves the sampling of different host protein circuits in an effort to ensure optimum host viability and maximum pathogen replication <xref rid="pone.0045154-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045154-Kover1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The targeting of high density, but non-core proteins may reflect an evolved strategic solution pathogens have employed to achieve optimal virulence <xref rid="pone.0045154-Best1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The high density of the targeted nodes may accelerate a pathogen's ability to adapt to selective pressure by switching to a closely related target or it may simply reflect the highly connected nature of the targeted suite of proteins involved with the control of gene expression and cellular metabolism.</p><p>The intra-cellular communication circuits include signals transduction components between organelle such as the nucleus and mitochondria as the cell strives to maintain homeostasis. Many of these communication circuits are involved with host metabolism and are the same proteins co-opted to construct pathogen progeny.

The number of interacting pathogens for a given protein node (denoted by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e113.jpg"/></inline-formula> in this paper) is the total number of proteins in all pathogen protein networks (considered for that host species) which interact with that protein node.</p><p>The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0045154.e114.jpg"/></inline-formula>-shell decomposition method can be described as follows.
