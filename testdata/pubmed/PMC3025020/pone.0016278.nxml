Cells pre-acclimated to high CO<sub>2</sub> (5&#x00025;, HC) or limited CO<sub>2</sub> (0.035&#x00025;, LC) conditions were pulse-labelled under very high (2&#x00025; w/w) <sup>13</sup>C-NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (VHC) conditions followed by treatment with ambient <sup>12</sup>C at HC and LC conditions, respectively.

The endosymbiotic uptake of an ancient cyanobacterial ancestor by a eukaryotic cell initiated the evolution of phototrophic algae and plants. Many of the initial cyanobacterial proteins are still detectable within the chloroplasts and nuclear genomes of current higher plants <xref rid="pone.0016278-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016278-Deusch1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In both cyanobacteria and C3 plants, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation is primarily catalysed by the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). The carboxylase reaction generates two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA) from ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate and CO<sub>2</sub>, whereas O<sub>2</sub> competition at the reaction centre leads to the oxygenase products 3PGA and 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG) <xref rid="pone.0016278-Tolbert1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The product 2PG is a cellular toxin that needs to be detoxified, as it inhibits Calvin-Cycle enzymes <xref rid="pone.0016278-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0016278-Norman1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In plants, 2PG is scavenged by a sequence of reactions called the photorespiratory C2 pathway <xref rid="pone.0016278-Somerville1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0016278-Bauwe1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, which regenerates one molecule of 3PGA for every two molecules of 2PG, at the cost of CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub>
<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> release.</p><p>In contrast to higher plants, 2PG metabolism was thought to exert negligible effects in cyanobacteria. Early studies only indicated the formation of glycolate from 2PG <xref rid="pone.0016278-Colman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, the discovery of a sophisticated inorganic carbon (C<sub>i</sub>) concentration mechanism (CCM) demonstrated the potential of cyanobacteria to increase the internal concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the vicinity of Rubisco and thus to compensate for the low CO<sub>2</sub> affinity of the cyanobacterial enzyme <xref rid="pone.0016278-Kaplan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. As a consequence, the CCM was thought to be sufficient to suppress the oxygenase reaction and to make photorespiratory detoxification irrelevant for cyanobacterial metabolism.</p><p>Recent studies, however, demonstrated not only that the CCM is insufficient to prevent ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate oxygenation in an O<sub>2</sub>-containing atmosphere but also that there is active 2PG metabolism. The photorespiratory pathways were found to be essential for growth under atmospheric conditions <xref rid="pone.0016278-Eisenhut1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016278-Eisenhut2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Photorespiratory 2PG metabolism in the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. strain PCC 6803 (hereafter <italic>Synechocystis</italic>) comprises three alternative paths: a plant-like C2 cycle, a bacterial glycerate pathway, and the complete decarboxylation of glyoxylate via oxalate. Mutants defective in specific enzymes within these pathways including glycolate dehydrogenase (&#x00394;<italic>glcD1</italic>, <italic>sll</italic>0404) and glycine decarboxylase (&#x00394;<italic>gcvT</italic>, <italic>sll</italic>0171) displayed growth retardation. In addition, intermediates of photorespiratory 2PG metabolism accumulated in agreement with the enzymatic defect; these intermediates included glycolate in &#x00394;<italic>glcD1</italic> and glycine in &#x00394;<italic>gcvT</italic>. These phenomena were already apparent under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (5&#x00025;, high CO<sub>2</sub>, HC), and were enhanced under the low-CO<sub>2</sub>-availability conditions of ambient air (&#x0223c;0.035&#x00025;, low CO<sub>2</sub>, LC) <xref rid="pone.0016278-Eisenhut2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016278-Eisenhut3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The C<sub>i</sub> affinity and the maximum rate of photosynthesis were found to be higher in cells grown under LC conditions than in cells grown under HC conditions <xref rid="pone.0016278-Eisenhut2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Transcript and metabolite profiles of the wild-type (WT) strain compared to the above-mentioned mutants indicated that the photorespiratory mutants, when grown under HC conditions, display gene expression and metabolite patterns that are characteristic for WT cells when shifted from HC to LC conditions <xref rid="pone.0016278-Eisenhut3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016278-Eisenhut4" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Characterisation of changes of metabolite pools opened the path towards currently unanswered questions, including: (1) Is the previously observed accumulation of intermediates, such as glycolate and glycine, indeed linked to photorespiration? (2) How is the ratio of Rubisco oxygenation to carboxylation influenced by altered C<sub>i</sub> availability? (3) Which routes of carbon fixation are used under HC or LC conditions? To approach these questions, we applied a non-steady state <sup>13</sup>C<sub>i</sub> pulse and chase experimental design similar to work previously published by our lab <xref rid="pone.0016278-Huege1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The appearance and dilution of <sup>13</sup>C labelled intermediates within the primary metabolism of photoautotrophically grown WT and selected mutant cells was monitored following the suggestions made for dynamic flux analyses <xref rid="pone.0016278-Ratcliffe1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. With this approach, we reveal the use and modulation of the major paths of carbon assimilation in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experimental design of metabolic flux analysis</title><p>Pulse labelling of photoautotrophic <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cultures was performed by adding aliquots of a saturated solution of <sup>13</sup>C labelled NaHCO<sub>3</sub> to a final concentration of 2&#x00025; (w/w). This procedure resulted in a very high carbon (VHC) pulse and was chosen to ensure a step change with the highest <sup>13</sup>C enrichment possible. Moreover, the VHC conditions should suppress the oxygenase activity of Rubisco. We combined the <sup>13</sup>C<sub>i</sub> pulse of stably labelled bicarbonate with a chase using unlabelled CO<sub>2</sub>. Our experimental procedure generated an optimal rectangular step change during the <sup>13</sup>C<sub>i</sub> pulse and sufficient enrichment for short isotope dilution times of 10&#x02013;60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In the following study, we focused on the metabolite pools that reached high <sup>13</sup>C enrichment and thus allowed optimal GC-MS-based analysis. The VHC pulse was applied to cells that pre-acclimated to 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> (HC) or to 0.035&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> (LC) conditions, as previously reported <xref rid="pone.0016278-Eisenhut3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. For the chase, a quick medium exchange was performed. The cells were subsequently incubated under continuous aeration with either HC or LC identical to the initial pre-acclimation. Our previous work on metabolic profiling revealed highly reproducible metabolic patterns after HC or LC acclimation and indicated that near-steady-state conditions could be achieved using standardised batch cultivation <xref rid="pone.0016278-Eisenhut3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0016278-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0016278.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental design of the dynamic metabolic flux analyses in photoautotrophic cultures of <italic>Synechocystis</italic>.</title><p>The cells were monitored by combined pool size and <sup>13</sup>C enrichment analyses of (A) 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA) and (B) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).

The metabolomic data were extended by parameters derived from mass isotopomer distribution analyses, i.e., the initial rate of <sup>13</sup>C accumulation during the first 10 min and the maximum <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at 20&#x02013;60 min. Both parameters were calculated from the transient labelling kinetics of each of the monitored metabolite pools. Based on the analysis of 3PGA as the main entry point of the <sup>13</sup>C label in photoautotrophic cultures of <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, we estimated the general features of the chosen experimental design. The 3PGA levels did not change after pre-acclimation to HC and LC or throughout the VHC pulse but increased clearly upon initiation of both the HC and LC chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). As both chase conditions represented a shift to lower C<sub>i</sub> availability, these observations were in agreement with the previously observed increase of the 3PGA pool 3 h after a shift from HC to LC <xref rid="pone.0016278-Eisenhut3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In parallel, the transient <sup>13</sup>C labelling of the 3PGA pool was assessed during pulse and chase. Under our labelling conditions, the 3PGA pool reached its maximum saturated <sup>13</sup>C enrichment 10 min after the pulse in both the HC and LC acclimated cells. LC cells showed a more rapid <sup>13</sup>C accumulation. During the chase period with HC conditions, labelling returned below 10&#x00025; within 30 min. Under LC conditions, a delayed chase response was observed. As expected, the empirical mass distribution vectors of 3PGA and PEP indicated homogenous <sup>13</sup>C labelling. The kinetic behaviour of the mass distribution vectors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016278.s002">Figure S1</xref>) was generally in agreement with the modelled predictions reported earlier <xref rid="pone.0016278-Shastri1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The presence of unlabelled ambient CO<sub>2</sub> resulted in a perceptible isotope dilution compared to the 98&#x00025; enrichment of the applied NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. For example, the final <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in the 3PGA pool was on average &#x0003e;82&#x00025; and &#x0003e;89&#x00025; for the HC and LC conditions, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016278.s004">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, the label exchange for the chase phase indicated a step change only for the HC condition. Under LC conditions, the label exchange was clearly delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Dilution and carryover effects at chase initiation were unavoidable in our hands, especially when implementing the LC chase conditions. Therefore, the slow return of <sup>13</sup>C label in 3PGA could be caused by both an insufficient physical dilution of <sup>13</sup>C label and by a physiological effect of the CCM, which is activated under LC conditions but suppressed under HC conditions <xref rid="pone.0016278-Kaplan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. To account for these effects, we used the enrichment data of the first assimilation products, for example 3PGA, to correct the influence of ambient CO<sub>2</sub> and any potential label carryover.</p><p>In this study, we analysed the pool size and labelling kinetics as <sup>13</sup>C enrichment parameters of the observed metabolite pools. Each of these parameters will first be reported in context of the HC versus LC pre-acclimation for the WT strain. Subsequently, the respective phenotypes of the mutant strains will be presented. We focused on the mutants <italic>&#x00394;glcD1</italic> (<italic>&#x00394;sll</italic>0404), which is deficient for one of the two isoforms of glycolate dehydrogenase, and <italic>&#x00394;gcvT</italic> (<italic>&#x00394;sll</italic>0171), deficient for the T-protein subunit of the glycine decarboxylase complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The entry points of the <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> label: 3PGA and PEP</title><p>The two most rapidly and completely labelled metabolite pools were the 3PGA pool, as expected, and, unexpectedly, the PEP pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The <sup>13</sup>C enrichment was higher and the rate of <sup>13</sup>C labelling was faster in the PEP pool compared to the 3PGA pool under all conditions and in all analysed mutants. The Student's t-test of the differences in <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at 20&#x02013;60 min after the pulse and in the initial <sup>13</sup>C accumulation rate at 0.5&#x02013;10.0 min showed that these differences were highly significant in both cases, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.00008 and p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.050, respectively. These results are documented in more detail by the PEP/3PGA ratios of both measurements, which were consistently &#x0003e;1.0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0016278-t001">Table 1</xref>). The kinetic analysis of the PEP/3PGA ratio of <sup>13</sup>C enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g002">Figure 2</xref>) demonstrated that the PEP pool was labelled faster in the pulse phase and was also de-labelled faster in the chase phases. This observation coincided with a general increase in both pool sizes upon shift from VHC during the pulse phase to HC or LC during the chase phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The 3PGA pool increased by more than the PEP pool, as demonstrated by a reduction of the PEP/3PGA pool size ratio from above 1 to about 0.15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0016278-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0016278.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Ratios of PEP/3PGA <sup>13</sup>C enrichment (A) and respective pool sizes (B).</title><p>The pulse and chase conditions used in HC and LC acclimated <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.

Carbon of ambient mass isotopomer composition appears to enter the aspartate pool first and to persist longest within the citrate pool. The initiation of the pulse (0 min) and chase (60 min) are indicated by arrows.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0016278.g005"/></fig><p>During the VHC pulse, <sup>13</sup>C accumulation was highest in the citrate pool, followed by the malate and aspartate pools. Unexpectedly, the order changed over the monitored time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g005">Figure 5</xref>). At the onset of the pulse phase, <sup>13</sup>C enrichment was highest in the aspartate pool, followed by the malate and citrate pools. The reversal of <sup>13</sup>C enrichment was noticeable in cells pre-acclimated to HC and became obvious under LC conditions. The LC condition also demonstrated the mobilisation of unlabelled carbon during the early phase of the VHC pulse. This internal carbon source first entered the aspartate pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g005">Figure 5</xref>, arrow) and appeared to persist for the longest time in the citrate pool. Under the same conditions, the ornithine analyte showed essentially the same internal carbon mobilisation effect as aspartate but with lower <sup>13</sup>C enrichment (data not shown). Note that due to chemical conversions during the derivatisation of metabolites for GC-MS analysis, the measured ornithine analyte represents the sum of the ornithine, arginine, and citrulline pools.</p><p>Indications of additional <sup>13</sup>C fixation through PEP carboxylase activity were found by analysing the ratios of the initial rates of <sup>13</sup>C accumulation for the various compounds with respect to PEP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0016278.s004">Table S1B</xref>). In WT cells, the 3PGA/PEP, citrate/PEP, and malate/PEP ratios of the initial rates of <sup>13</sup>C accumulation were &#x0223c;0.96, &#x0223c;0.78, and &#x0223c;0.62, respectively. These ratios were not influenced by pre-acclimation of the WT cells to the HC or LC conditions. The aspartate/PEP ratio was, however, increased by 1.34 fold under the LC condition (0.65) compared to the HC condition (0.48). This LC acclimation effect was even more apparent in the two photorespiratory mutants, <italic>&#x00394;glcD1</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;gcvT</italic>, with aspartate/PEP ratios approximating 1 under LC conditions in both mutants. A similar but less extreme effect in the mutants was observed for the malate/PEP ratios. These ratios increased by &#x0223c;1.3-fold in cells pre-acclimated to LC compared to those receiving HC. The citrate/PEP ratios showed the same tendency under the LC condition and were only marginally increased in the mutant strains compared to WT. Under HC, the citrate/PEP ratios were, however, reduced in both mutants compared to WT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>The major paths of carbon assimilation in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>
</title><p>Our data were essentially consistent with the established fact that 3PGA is the first assimilation product of the Calvin-Benson cycle. Rapid labelling of 3PGA with <sup>13</sup>C suggests that C3-photosynthesis is the dominant carbon fixation pathway in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>. Fixation of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>i</sub> via PEP carboxylase seems to be less important, but occured in LC acclimated cells (see below). Following the dilution of the initial <sup>13</sup>C label of 3PGA into the metabolite pools that were measured by our GC-MS-based technology, we observed two major branches of carbon flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The first branch leads from 3PGA to sucrose via G6P with minimal leakage of carbon into the free glucose pool. The flux of carbon from 3PGA through this branch into sucrose appears to reflect the photosynthesis rate of the respective pre-acclimated cells <xref rid="pone.0016278-Eisenhut3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> because the enrichment of the sucrose pool is higher in LC cells than in HC cells (cf. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0016278-t002">Table 2</xref>). The observed conversion of 3-PGA into sucrose and probably also into glycogen shows that surplus carbon is converted into storage compounds. The second major path of carbon appears to lead to aspartate, malate, and citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g006">Figure 6</xref>) via PEP and probably further into the amino acid pools via 2-oxo-glutarate. This second branch of 3PGA utilisation directly fuels the biosynthesis of primary metabolites, specifically amino acids that are generated via the incomplete tricarboxylic acid cycle of <italic>Synechocystis</italic>. In agreement with the interruption of the canonical tricarboxylic acid cycle in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, fumarate and succinate were labelled more slowly than malate (data not shown).</p><fig id="pone-0016278-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0016278.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Scheme of central carbon and nitrogen metabolism in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. strain PCC 6803.</title><p>Ellipses highlight the <sup>13</sup>C labelled metabolites detected and evaluated in this study.

The joint action of C3 and C4 carboxylation via Rubisco and PEP carboxylase, respectively, has been revealed by <sup>14</sup>C labelling experiments using different cyanobacterial strains, as shown by D&#x000f6;hler <xref rid="pone.0016278-Dhler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, the relative ratio is still a matter of discussion. The oxaloacetate product, which cannot directly be measured by our current technique, appears to be rapidly converted into aspartate and malate via the aspartate aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase reactions. Of the potential oxaloacetate products, citrate is the most rapidly labelled, possibly because it receives part of its carbon backbone via acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA should be highly labelled because it is generated from the rapidly labelled PEP pool via the final steps of the glycolytic pathway. However, as judged by the rates of <sup>13</sup>C accumulation, the C3 carboxylating pathway from 3PGA via PEP appears to be the main route to transfer newly fixed organic carbon into the central metabolism of <italic>Synechocystis</italic>. The <sup>13</sup>C enrichment of oxaloacetate products shows that primary <sup>13</sup>C<sub>i</sub> fixation via Rubisco is dominant under our experimental conditions.</p><p>One of the unexpected results was the observation that first aspartate and then malate and citrate receive <sup>12</sup>C from internal stores during the <sup>13</sup>C<sub>i</sub>-VHC pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We interpret this observation as a carbon mobilisation from internal sources into the aspartate and ornithine/arginine/citrulline pools. The source could be fast cyanophycin degradation. Cyanophycin is a storage polymer in cyanobacteria that has a poly-aspartate backbone and arginine side chains. Cyanophycin accumulates mainly as a response to excess nitrogen in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0016278-Maheswaran1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The VHC pulse results in an environment characterised by high C<sub>i</sub> availability and relatively low nitrogen. This should apply especially to LC cells, which were pre-acclimated to rather high C/N conditions. Cyanophycin degradation mobilises stored nitrogen and may ultimately lead to rebalancing of the intercellular C/N ratio. Such a mobilisation process should be considered in future studies that aim at dissecting the relative contribution of C3 and C4 metabolism to the biosynthesis of organic acid intermediates such as citrate.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Indications for carbon channelling from 3PGA into the PEP pool</title><p>Had Calvin and Benson <xref rid="pone.0016278-Calvin1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016278-Calvin2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> used <italic>Synechocystis</italic> to unravel the photosynthetic carbon cycle, PEP would have likely been misinterpreted as the first assimilation product of the carboxylation reactions. We found clear evidence that the PEP pool of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is not only more rapidly labelled but also has a slightly but significantly higher final <sup>13</sup>C enrichment than the 3PGA pool under all of our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0016278-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Even today, this phenomenon could be interpreted as evidence for the presence of alternative CO<sub>2</sub> fixation mechanisms in cyanobacteria. Such pathways for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, e.g., the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle or the carbamoylphosphate synthetase pathway, have previously been suggested to be operative in cyanobacteria <xref rid="pone.0016278-Tabita1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Both paths have been implicated for ancillary CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In view of the incomplete tricarboxylic acid cycle in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> and considering our data, i.e., the lower rates of <sup>13</sup>C accumulation in the citrate and malate pools compared to the PEP pool, we consider it unlikely that under our growth conditions <italic>Synechocystis</italic> utilizes any of the above ancillary routes of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation or the hydroxypropionate pathway for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, which was recently discovered in <italic>Chloroflexus aurantiacus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0016278-Tabita2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This view is supported by the absence of genes for such alternative C fixation pathways from the complete genome sequence of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (CyanoBase at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/Synechocystis">http://genome.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase/Synechocystis</ext-link>).</p><p>Instead, we favour the interpretation that the majority of newly assimilated carbon is channelled from 3PGA to PEP, and the much smaller PEP pool is more quickly saturated with <sup>13</sup>C. With this interpretation, we need to assume that two sub-pools of 3PGA exist in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>. The carboxysome, a cyanobacterial micro-compartment that is a component of the CCM and harbours most of the cellular Rubisco, may well be a rapidly labelled 3PGA pool from which PEP is produced. The second 3PGA pool may be cytosolic. The cytosolic 3PGA pool could originate from a second pool of Rubisco. Rubisco was recently indicated to exist outside of the carboxysome but attached to thylakoids and in close association with other Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes <xref rid="pone.0016278-Agarwal1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Carbon should be channelled into PEP either within the carboxysomes or along with the export of 3PGA from the carboxysome into the cytosol. The cytosolic 3PGA pool may well be diluted with unlabelled carbon as a result of the turnover or mobilisation of previously assimilated soluble sugars or glycogen. Channelling into PEP may also indicate that the PEP carboxylase reaction for <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is more important than previously described <xref rid="pone.0016278-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This conclusion is well supported by the rapid accumulation of assimilated carbon in pools downstream of oxaloacetate (cf. discussion above) and may explain enigmatic early reports of high accumulations of label in unexpected metabolite pools, such as the aspartate pool <xref rid="pone.0016278-Dhler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0016278-Tabita1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Formal demonstration of photorespiratory flux</title><p>We detected a significant partitioning of the <sup>13</sup>C label into the glycolate pool, primarily in the <italic>&#x00394;glcD1</italic> mutant, but also in WT cells under our VHC pulse conditions.

Moreover, HC acclimation was linked to greater channelling of assimilate into the PEP pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0016278-g002">Figure 2</xref>).
