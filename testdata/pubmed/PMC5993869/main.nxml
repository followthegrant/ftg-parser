The benefits of physical activity &#x02013; including reduced risk of noncommunicable diseases and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression &#x02013; are well known [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults (including elderly) engage in at least 150&#x0202f;min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity each week [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Figures from European Union (EU) countries indicate that six in every 10 people above 15 years of age never or seldom exercise or play any sports, and more than half never or seldom engage in other kind of physical activity, such as cycling or walking, household chores or gardening [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Another study confirms this trend pointing out that one third of adults in Europe are insufficiently active [<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], in particular those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, minority ethnic groups, and people with disabilities [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Physical activity levels have declined among adolescents of 11&#x02013;15 years of age, with girls being consistently less active than boys [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Only 34% of 13&#x02013;15&#x0202f;year olds are active enough to meet the current WHO recommendation for children and adolescents, which is to maintain at least 60&#x0202f;min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity every day [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Such physical inactivity contributes further to overweight and obesity, especially in young people from low socioeconomic backgrounds [<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Research from the WHO European Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative shows that in some European countries more than 40% children are overweight and approximately 25% are obese [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This pattern also continues into adulthood, with current data indicating that more than 50% of adults are overweight in the majority of European countries [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], thus further contributing to the proliferation of noncommunicable diseases [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="par0030">To address the problem of physical inactivity, many governments of the 28&#x02009;EU countries have started to act in the last few years, by adopting policies that promote health-enhancing physical activity (HEPA) [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nonetheless, as high levels of insufficient physical activity show no sign of decline in the population, there is a clear need for governments to do more. EU Member States, meeting in the Council of the EU, acknowledged the benefits of action at EU level, leading to the adoption of the Council of the EU Recommendation on promoting HEPA across sectors in 2013 [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The Council's aim was to encourage Member States to develop a cross-sectoral approach involving policy areas such as sport, health, education, environment and transport in their national strategies and action plans. In September 2015, ministers of the 53 Member States of the WHO European Region adopted the first ever Physical Activity Strategy for the European Region 2016&#x02013;2025 [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The strategy focuses on all forms of physical activity promotion throughout the life-course in order to address the burden of noncommunicable diseases associated with insufficient activity levels and sedentary behaviour, thus enabling all citizens to live healthier and longer lives.</p><p id="par0035">In the Recommendation, the Council of the EU recognized that more data with reliable and timely information on the situation across Member States was instrumental to support national and regional policy-making. To address this need, the Council of the EU proposed a monitoring framework based on the EU Physical Activity guidelines [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which contained 23 indicators covering different themes relevant for HEPA (referred to hereafter as the HEPA monitoring framework).</p><p id="par0040">The aim of this paper is to present the findings from the first round of reporting on the HEPA monitoring framework. This information represents a basis for comparison of country-specific data collected on HEPA policy developments across sectors in EU Member States.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="par0045">The Council of the EU Recommendation called on each EU Member State to appoint a national HEPA focal point, in accordance with national legislation and practice. All 28&#x02009;EU Member States designated their focal points by mid-2014 and the network of national HEPA focal points was launched in Rome in October 2014. Its main role, in line with the Recommendation, was to coordinate the national collection of information for the monitoring framework.</p><p id="par0050">A survey tool was developed to explore national actions by Member States and describe their capacity in various sectors, as set out in the 23 specific indicators of the HEPA monitoring framework. An indicator was considered implemented when a Member State had introduced a policy or programme as described by this indicator, although information about the specific policies within each indicator was also provided. The survey also included the option to mention if an indicator implementation is being prepared and is foreseen in the next two years.</p><p id="par0055">Detailed information on definitions, operationalization, and data sources for the indicators can be found in the European Commission's working document [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="par0060">The survey was piloted between October 2014 and January 2015, and based on an initial subset of eight indicators. A revised questionnaire was sent out in April 2015 and the contact persons in each country were asked to submit information on all 23 indicators to the WHO Regional Office for Europe by the end of June 2015. Upon receipt, information was checked for completeness and clarification in order to improve the quality of the data. To enable validation, the policy documents cited were reviewed to identify whether they had been adopted and endorsed by the government and whether clear objectives and policy actions were described. Data was assessed to evaluate the overall situation and the extent of the implementation of HEPA promotion policies.</p><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Monitoring framework</title><p id="par0065">The monitoring framework [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] is composed of 23 indicators relating to the following key themes of the Council of the EU Recommendation: international physical activity recommendations and guidelines;

Data from international studies was also reported &#x02013; six countries reported Eurobarometer [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] data and two countries used European Health Interview Survey [<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] results as their national data on physical activity prevalence. In addition, one country also reported data from objective measurements of physical activity and used instruments such as accelerometers. In countries where no national studies were available, physical activity prevalence in adults was extracted from the WHO&#x02019;s Global Health Observatory (GHO) estimates, which was established to generate comparable data in multiple areas, including physical activity [<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p id="par0195">Numerous existing standardized instruments, to support the national monitoring of physical activity levels in adults, were used. Examples include the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) [<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; the European Commission&#x02019;s Eurobarometer [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; or a national verified source (i.e. policy documents, or national recommendations, and national studies).</p><p id="par0200">The reported prevalence data revealed big differences within countries, depending on the methodologies used. For example, one national survey reported a 34% prevalence of physical activity among adults 18&#x02013;65 years of age, but another nationally representative study, based on objective measurements of physical activity, showed 24% of all adults (18&#x02013;85 years of age) meeting current WHO recommendations. In another example, data from the national study indicated a 66% prevalence of physical activity among adults (18&#x02013;69 years of age), while Eurobarometer data suggest that only 25% of adults in that country meet WHO recommended levels. Such examples highlight discrepancies in data due to a wide variety of instruments and methodologies used. This creates difficulties in establishing validity and comparability across the EU.</p><p id="par0205">The GHO estimates for adults were much higher than prevalence levels reported in national studies or measured by other instruments. For example, in one country the GHO estimate was more than double that shown for the national study (74%), and in another the GHO estimate was 80% compared to 18% reported by the national study. Overall for the 28&#x02009;EU Member States, GHO estimates indicated that adult men were slightly more active than women, with 59.7%&#x02013;88% of adult males and 50.1%&#x02013;82.1% of adult females meeting WHO recommended physical activity levels. As can be seen from the examples above, however, these values cannot be compared to the national studies.</p><p id="par0210">There were also differences in instruments and surveys within countries regarding the data for children and adolescents (<xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Across the EU, eight countries reported data from their national surveys, and two countries extracted data using objective measurement techniques. In total, 17 countries reported data from Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) [<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] survey. For example, the national survey data in one country reported that 20% of adolescents (11&#x02013;15 years old) reached the WHO recommended physical activity levels, but an objective measurement study reported that 50% of 7&#x02013;12 years old in the country were meeting the WHO recommendation.</p><p id="par0215">GHO estimates for adolescents were derived from HBSC data combined from more than one round of data collection, possibly explaining similar or slightly lower values when compared to data from national studies. For example, one national study reported a physical activity prevalence of 29% among 11&#x02013;15 year-olds, whereas the GHO value was 17%. In another example, national survey data revealed a prevalence of 28% for children and adolescents (3&#x02013;18 years), and GHO estimates for the same country showed a prevalence of 17% for adolescents (11&#x02013;15 years old). In the EU Member States for which GHO estimates for adolescents were available (no data was available for Cyprus), 9%&#x02013;35.4% of boys and 7.4%&#x02013;20.4% of girls, were meeting the WHO recommended level of physical activity [<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p id="par0220">Only one country reported no data from children and adolescents in the present study.</p><p id="par0225">While all of the information provided is valuable by offering an overview of surveillance indicators in the countries, it is important to note that these national data do not allow for comparisons across countries due to sampling and other methodological differences.</p></sec><sec id="sec0085"><label>3.3</label><title>Cross-sectoral approach &#x02013; indicators 4 and 5</title><p id="par0230">A total of 16 countries (59.3%) reported having a fully developed and implemented specific national coordinating mechanism (advisory body, coordinating institution, academia, working group, or community) on HEPA promotion.

Second, different methods are used to collect data, which variagates the results. For example, national physical activity surveys sometimes used non-standardized instruments or have switched from non- standardized to standardized instruments (such as IPAQ or GPAQ) leading to a loss of time-series of national data.</p><p id="par0365">In addition, standardized instruments were not always used according to the adopted protocols, leading to a lack of comparability between surveys even though the same instruments had been used.</p><p id="par0370">While discrepancies between GHO prevalence estimates and results from other instruments were found, this is most likely due to the methodology for calculating the estimates. The GHO estimates remain one of the most reliable and used tools available for inter-country comparison at this point in time.</p><p id="par0375">It is notable that only a few countries have implemented policies covering all areas of the monitoring framework, indicating that there is clearly room for improvement across the EU.</p><p id="par0380">Areas with less indicators accomplishment that need more investment are the &#x0201c;Senior Citizens&#x0201d; sector followed by the &#x0201c;Working Environment&#x0201d;, and the &#x0201c;Environment, Urban Planning, and Public Safety&#x0201d; sectors. Overall, indicators with less than 50% of accomplishment are indicators 7 (<italic>Sport Clubs for Health</italic> Programme), 8 (Framework to support offers to increase access to exercise facilities for socially disadvantaged groups), 11 (Counseling on physical activity), 16 (Schemes promoting active travel to school), 18 (European guidelines for improving infrastructures for leisure-time physical activity), 20 (Schemes to promote physical activity at the workplace) and 21 (Schemes for community interventions to promote physical activity in older adults). More policies on these indicators should be incentivized.</p><p id="par0385">As Member States often provided references in their national languages, the language barrier made it challenging to verify some of the information. While the effectiveness of individual policies could not be measured, the adoption of policies could be verified.</p><p id="par0390">Some countries also provided information on HEPA funding.

This first round of results from the monitoring framework shows the need to create HEPA coordination structures over the next few years. The data presented here should also be used as a basis for Member States to share their experiences, such as through the HEPA focal point network.
