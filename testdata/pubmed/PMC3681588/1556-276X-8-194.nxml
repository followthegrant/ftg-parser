Such light emitters present an attractive application not only for inter-/intrachip optical interconnects but also, e.g., micro-displays and biological detection. Among the different approaches, rare-earth ion-based materials are very promising candidates due to their outstanding optical properties. Recently, it has been demonstrated that erbium silicate has one order of magnitude higher optically active rare-earth ions than those done through doping, without clustering or precipitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This may open new and interesting perspectives for rare-earth applications in photonics.</p><p>Among the various rare earths, Eu ions also have been attracting great interest in optoelectronic application because of its intense and stable emission in the visible region. Compared with other trivalent rare-earth ions, Eu<sup>2+</sup> emission intensity is several orders stronger because of dipole-allowed transition. This makes for the successful application of Eu<sup>2+</sup> in phosphors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and electroluminescent devices, by incorporating Eu<sup>2+</sup> (such as those doped in SiO<sub>2</sub> and Eu silicate), have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Bellocchi et al. have shown that the external quantum efficiency of Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> can be reached at about 10%, making Eu silicate of great interest for photonic application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, in their work, Eu silicate was obtained through the complex reaction between the deposited Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> film and Si substrate, which would inevitably cause inhomogeneous distribution of Eu silicate.</p><p>In this paper, we show that Eu silicate can be fabricated by optimizing the Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Si multilayer nanostructure deposited on Si substrates. Both the structural and optical properties of nanostructures are studied in detail. Through precisely controlling the thickness of Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Si layer at nanometer scale, the Eu silicate with highly efficient room-temperature (RT) light emission associated to Eu<sup>2+</sup> ions is obtained after annealing in N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> /Si multilayer films with five periods were grown on Si substrates at 400&#x000b0;C by RF magnetron sputtering. The thin films were deposited in 3.0-mTorr Ar atmosphere. The Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer and Si layer were prepared by alternately sputtering the Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> target and Si target. The thickness of Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layers was kept the same in all samples, while the thickness of Si layers was varied in different samples, as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. After deposition, the samples were thermally treated at 1,000&#x000b0;C for 30 s in N<sub>2</sub> ambient by rapid thermal annealing. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) was conducted to investigate the samples' morphology. The distribution of elements in the film was detected by scanning TEM (STEM), and crystallization was demonstrated by selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED). Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) was carried out to investigate the film composition. The samples' crystalline phases were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max 2400, Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) measurements. RT photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) measurements were performed by using a spectrofluorometer (Nano Log, HORIBA Ltd., Minami-Ku, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a 450-W Xe lamp.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Eu</bold><sub><bold>2</bold></sub><bold>O</bold><sub><bold>3</bold></sub><bold>/Si multilayer structure</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Sample</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Thickness of Eu</bold><sub><bold>2</bold></sub><bold>O</bold><sub><bold>3 </bold></sub><bold>layer (nm)</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Thickness of Si layer (nm)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">1<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">8<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">2<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">17<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">3<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">25<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">4</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">42</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The cross-sectional TEM images of as-deposited sample are shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>a,b. The film thickness is about 150 nm, with 5 nm in the Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer and 25 nm in the Si layer in one period. The interface between Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Si is very sharp and clear. Moreover, multicrystalline Si has formed in Si layers in the as-deposited sample, which has also been confirmed by SAED, as shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>c. The interplanar spacing (<italic>d</italic>) is about 3.11 &#x000c5; from the radius of the primary diffraction ring, which agrees with the <italic>d</italic> of the Si (111) plane. We think that the high substrate temperature and the Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer may induce Si crystallization.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cross-sectional TEM images of as-deposited sample 3.</bold> (<bold>a</bold>) Full view of the film, (<bold>b</bold>) partial enlarged view of the film, and (<bold>c</bold>) the SAED image of the film.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1556-276X-8-194-1"/></fig><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>a,b shows the TEM cross section of the sample with a Si layer thickness of about 25 nm after annealing at 1,000&#x000b0;C for 30 s in N<sub>2</sub> ambient. The interfaces between Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layers and Si layers became blurry. This indicates that the strong reaction between Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Si has happened. Moreover, the crystalline europium silicate had been formed through solid-state reaction, as proven by SAED, which shows a multicrystalline ring in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>c. From the SAED figures, the annealed film gave a totally different pattern compared with the as-deposited film. A lot of diffraction spots were distributed randomly, which may be ascribed to the different crystalline structures of europium silicate. In order to investigate the element distribution after the annealing process, STEM measurements were also carried out. As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Si, Eu, and O are distributed homogeneously along the thickness, suggesting that Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Si reacted completely in each layer.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cross-sectional TEM images of the annealed sample 3.</bold> (<bold>a</bold>) Full view of the film, (<bold>b</bold>) partial enlarged view of the film, and (<bold>c</bold>) the SAED image of the film.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1556-276X-8-194-2"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The spectra of Eu, Si, and O distribution with thickness.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1556-276X-8-194-3"/></fig><p>The crystalline structure of the annealed films with different Si layer thicknesses was performed using XRD measurements, as shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. The XRD spectrum of the sample with 8-nm Si layer shows that Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>, Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, and EuSiO<sub>3</sub> are mixed in the film after the annealing process. The corresponding JCPDS card numbers are 43-1008 (Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), 43-1009 (Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), 40-0286 (Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>), 22-0286 (Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), and 35-0297 (EuSiO<sub>3</sub>). Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> peaks are stronger and sharper than the other peaks, suggesting that Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is the major phase in the film due to the lack of Si. For the sample with a thicker Si layer, the XRD pattern was similar, but the Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> peak intensity had decreased. This is because more Eu<sup>3+</sup> ions were involved in the reaction with increasing Si layer thickness. The sample with 25-nm Si layer exhibited different XRD patterns compared with the first two samples. The peaks corresponding to Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub> (Eu<sup>3+</sup>) nearly disappeared, while the peaks corresponding to Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> became stronger. This indicates that Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> is the major phase in the film now. Moreover, through RBS measurements, the atomic concentrations of Eu, Si, and O were about 28, 14, and 58 at.% in the annealed film, which are very close to stoichiometric value of Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, which is consistent with the XRD results. This is interesting since the tetrahedron structure [SiO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>4&#x02212;</sup> can prevent Eu<sup>2+</sup> oxidation and energy transfer among the Eu<sup>2+</sup> ions by isolating the Eu<sup>2+</sup> ions with [SiO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>4&#x02212;</sup>. Thus, Eu<sup>2+</sup> in [SiO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>4&#x02212;</sup> can exhibit longer stabilization and higher efficiency, which is already used in commercial phosphor such as Eu-doped silicate. By further increasing the Si layer thickness to 42 nm, Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> reacted with Si totally, and the Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-related peaks disappeared completely, as demonstrated by the XRD spectrum. Now, the film is mainly composed of Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> and EuSiO<sub>3</sub> (Eu<sup>2+</sup>). This is consistent with Bellocchi's work where abundant Si may cause the formation of EuSiO<sub>3</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Finally, it is noticeable that most Eu ions in the sample with Si layer thicknesses between 25 and 42 nm became divalent (Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> and EuSiO<sub>3</sub>) after thermal treatments. This suggests that Eu<sup>2+</sup> silicate can be achieved by precisely controlling the Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Si layer thicknesses.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>XRD patterns of the annealed samples.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1556-276X-8-194-4"/></fig><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows the RT PL spectra of the annealed samples, excited by 365-nm light. The intensity of the emission peak from sample 1 (with 8-nm Si layer thickness) was very weak. The spectrum had a sharp main peak centered at 616 nm with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of about 10 nm, corresponding to the <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub> &#x02192; <sup>7</sup>F<sub>2</sub> transition of Eu<sup>3+</sup> ions; the other weak peaks centered at 579, 592, 653, and 703 nm, corresponding to the <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub> &#x02192; <sup>7</sup>F<sub>0</sub>, <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub> &#x02192; <sup>7</sup>F<sub>1</sub>, <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub> &#x02192; <sup>7</sup>F<sub>3</sub>, and <sup>5</sup>D<sub>0</sub> &#x02192; <sup>7</sup>F<sub>4</sub> transitions of Eu<sup>3+</sup> ions, respectively. This indicates that most Eu ions are still trivalent in sample 1, which agrees with the XRD results. Compared to sample 1, other samples exhibited different PL spectra. They showed strong and broad band emissions, having the maximum peak at about 610 nm and FWHM at about 130 nm, which are typical dipole-allowed 4<italic>f</italic><sup>6</sup>5<italic>d</italic> &#x02192; 4<italic>f</italic><sup>7</sup> transitions of Eu<sup>2+</sup> ions in Eu<sup>2+</sup> silicate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The red shift emission was possibly due to the fact that in Eu<sup>2+</sup> silicate the Madelung potential of the negative anions around Eu<sup>2+</sup> is felt less by the 5<italic>d</italic> electron, leading to a lowering of energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The emission peaks of Eu<sup>3+</sup> disappeared in the PL spectrum of sample 2 (with 17-nm Si layer thickness ) probably because more Eu<sup>3+</sup> ions in Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layers had been deoxidized by Si, and the emission peaks of Eu<sup>3+</sup> were submerged in the PL spectrum of Eu<sup>2+</sup>. As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, the sample with 25-nm Si layer thickness has the highest PL intensity among all the samples. The integrated PL intensity of sample 3 is more than two orders higher than that of sample 1, by forming Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> and EuSiO<sub>3</sub> through reaction with Si layer, as demonstrated in the XRD tests. However, with further increase of the Si layer thickness, the PL intensity decreased. This may be due to the formation of EuSiO<sub>3</sub> crystalline structure and the residual Si.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>RT PL spectra of the annealed samples.</bold> Excitation was 365 nm, and it was obtained by HORIBA Nano Log equipped with a 450-W Xe lamp.

However, no Eu<sup>2+</sup> ions were found after the annealing process. This indicates that divalent Eu ions only appear in the Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Si multilayer structure. We think that in Si-rich Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> films, the Eu ions are surrounded by the Si and O ions, and Eu<sup>3+</sup> silicate is formed directly during deposition. Also, it may be very difficult to form divalent Eu ions in Eu<sup>3+</sup> silicate without reducing gas, even if there is abundant Si. Compared with the work of Bellocchi et al, the thickness of Si layer can be precisely controlled in nanostructure instead of the Si substrate to avoid product uncertainty. Moreover, it is reported that in silicate compounds, Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> is a more efficient host for Eu<sup>2+</sup> light emission than the other configurations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although, in this work, the Eu trivalent state vanished in the nanostructure with increasing Si layer thickness, the divalent Eu ions exist both in Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> and EuSiO<sub>3</sub> crystalline structures. Thus, the efficiency and intensity of Eu<sup>2+</sup> light emission in Eu silicate will be further improved if the Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Si nanostructure is optimized to prepare pure Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, Eu silicate films were prepared by the annealing Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Si multilayer nanostructure in N<sub>2</sub> ambient. The Eu<sup>2+</sup> silicates were distributed uniformly along the thickness by the reaction between Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Si layers. Different crystalline structures were formed and identified by changing the Si layer thickness. Through precisely controlling the thickness of Si layer in Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Si multilayer, we have obtained Eu<sup>2+</sup> silicate films, characterized by an intense and broad PL peak that centered at 610 nm. Moreover, it suggests that Eu<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> phase is an efficient light emission for Eu<sup>2+</sup> by forming [SiO<sub>4</sub>]<sup>4&#x02212;</sup> configuration. These results will have promising perspectives for Si-based photonic applications.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>LL performed film fabrication, optical measurements, and structural measurements and also wrote the manuscript.
