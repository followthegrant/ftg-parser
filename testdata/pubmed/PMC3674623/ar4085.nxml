OA is grossly characterized by the degeneration of articular cartilage and the loss of cartilage matrix in affected joints. The pathological process of the disease involves changes in the survival of chondrocytes and is often associated with an inflammatory response. Chondrocytes are the only cells in articular cartilage, which play an important role in maintaining matrix integrity, pathological cascade process and tissue homeostasis. Beyond the compensation capability of chondrocytes in the OA process, apoptosis cells become the main source of various catabolic factors, such as proteases, proinflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Chondrocyte survival or apoptosis and inflammation are therefore important in the pathogenesis of OA.</p><p>Over the past decade, apoptosis has been identified as a critical factor responsible for cell loss in ageing OA cartilage. Many important mediators, including IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1;, caspase-8 and caspase-3, are involved in OA chondrocyte apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. IL-1&#x003b2; is one of the main cytokines that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of OA. This cytokine induces large-scale apoptosis in chondrocytes, which leads to further degenerative changes in cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover, it has been suggested that IL-1&#x003b2; induces the expression of the TNF&#x003b1; gene in chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and upregulates the surface expression of TNF receptor (TNFR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The death receptor, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum pathways are concluded to be the major cellular pathways of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These pathways are distinct in initiation and signaling, but a significant overlap exists in regulatory and effector mechanisms. The best known examples of death receptors include Fas and TNFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Upon binding of the respective ligand, protein interaction modules are used to assemble a receptor signaling complex called the death inducing signaling complex. This complex recruits and activates the upstream initiator caspases, including caspase-8, which leads, in turn, to the activation of effector caspases (caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7) and to internucleosomal DNA fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Inflammation is another promoting factor in the OA process, including chondrocyte and synovium inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The majority of the proinflammatory proteins linked to arthritis are regulated by the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B, which regulates the expression of a wide variety of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Combination of TNF and TNFR activates TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-2 to lead to the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK). The IKK family consists of two catalytic subunits (IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2;) and a noncatalytic regulatory subunit (IKK&#x003b3;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The canonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling (RelA:p50) relies upon IKK&#x003b3;-IKK&#x003b2;-mediated degradation of NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor, alpha (I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;), and the noncanonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling (RelB:p52) relies upon NF-&#x003ba;B inducing kinase and IKK&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Yong and colleagues showed that IKK&#x003b2; is the main IKK catalytic subunit responsible for I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; signal response domain phosphorylation in response to proinflammatory stimuli in chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In response to extracellular stimuli, such as TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B is often activated and subsequently facilitates the transcription of a number of genes involved in inflammation, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and specific cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The induced iNOS catalyzes the formation and release of a large amount of NO, which then plays a key role in OA pathophysiology. Induced by several stimuli, COX-2 is responsible for the production of large amounts of proinflammatory prostaglandins at the inflammatory site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Sodium ferulate (SF), a sodium salt of ferulic acid (3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-cinnamate sodium), is a natural component of traditional Chinese herbs and some foodstuffs. SF can be easily synthesized and is widely used in scientific research and clinical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Various beneficial effects of SF have been reported, including as an antioxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], for the removal of free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], anti-inflammatory actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and anti-apoptotic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Recently, for the first time our laboratory showed the beneficial effect of SF on OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We showed that SF reverses cartilage degradation processes and inhibits expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and BAX in a rat OA model <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also showed that SF prevents chondrocytes apoptosis, represses NO synthesis and attenuates the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-1/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 to prevent extracellular matrix degradation in human OA chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, the precise molecular mechanism responsible for SF's anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory effects in chondrocytes is not yet clear. According to the screen results of an apoptosis RT<sup>2 </sup>profile PCR array, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of SF on the TNF/TNFR signal transduction pathway, including the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway and the NF-&#x003ba;B signal transduction pathway, in rat OA chondrocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>SF was provided by YaoYou Medicine (Chongqing, China; 0.1 g/ampere, SFDA approval number H50021634).

Male Wistar rats (130 to 150 g, Animal Center of Wuhan University) were housed under controlled temperature and lighting conditions with food and water. Articular cartilage isolated from femoral head cap pieces was aseptically dissected, and chondrocytes were obtained after digestion of cartilage fragments in 0.25% trypsin (w/v) for 30 minutes followed by about 6 to 7 hours of digestion in 0.2% collagenase II (w/v) in DMEM without serum. Chondrocytes were cultured at a density of 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Experiments were performed with first-passage cultures. SF was prepared with sterile distilled water and diluted with DMEM. The concentration of SF was selected on the basis of our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Chondrocytes were divided into six groups: normal control group, chondrocytes without any treatments; OA model control group, chondrocytes treated with 20 ng/ml IL-1&#x003b2;; and SF treatment groups, OA model chondrocytes treated with 20 ng/ml IL-1&#x003b2; and 125, 250, 500 or 1,000 &#x003bc;mol/l SF, respectively.

Combination of TNF and TNF receptor (TNFR) on the cell membrane will activate two downstream signal pathways. One is the caspase cascade apoptosis pathway, which recruits TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and death domain (DD) and forms death inducing signaling complex (DISC), the initiator caspases (caspase-8), and activates executioner caspases (caspase-3).

From our study, the effective protection of SF in OA chondrocytes <italic>in vitro </italic>is involved not only in the anti-apoptosis process but also in the anti-inflammatory effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Ac-DEVD-<italic>p</italic>NA: acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp <italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide; Ac-IETD-<italic>p</italic>NA: acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp <italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide; BSA: bovine serum albumin; COX-2: cycloxygenase-2; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EMSA: electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;: NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor: alpha; IKK: inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B kinase; IL: interleukin; iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase; NF: nuclear factor; NO: nitric oxide; OA: osteoarthritis; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PI: propidium iodide; PGE2: prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>; SF: sodium ferulate; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; TNFR: tumor necrosis factor receptor; TRADD: TNF receptor-associated death domain; TRAF: TNF receptor-associated factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JQ and LS carried out the experimental work, collection, interpretation and manuscript drafting.
