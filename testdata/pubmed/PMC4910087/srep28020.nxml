However, AtaA, a TAA in the nonpathogenic <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp. strain Tol 5, shows nonspecific, high adhesiveness to abiotic material surfaces as well as to biotic surfaces. AtaA is a homotrimer of polypeptides comprising 3,630 amino acids and forms long nanofibers; therefore, it is too large and structurally complex to be produced as a recombinant protein. In this study, we isolated AtaA&#x02019;s passenger domain (AtaA PSD), which is translocated to the cell surface through the C-terminal transmembrane domain and exhibits biological functions, using a new method. We introduced a protease recognition site and reaped AtaA nanofibers 225&#x02009;nm in length from the cell surface through proteolytic cleavage with a specific protease. Biochemical and biophysical analyses of the purified native AtaA PSD revealed that it has a stable structure under alkaline and acidic conditions. Temperatures above 80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, which disrupted AtaA&#x02019;s higher-order structure but maintained the full-length AtaA polypeptide, inactivated AtaA&#x02019;s nonspecific adhesiveness, suggesting that the stickiness of AtaA requires its 3D structure. This finding refutes the widespread but vague speculation that large unfolded polypeptides readily stick to various surfaces.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In autotransporters, extracellular proteins in diverse Gram-negative bacteria, the transmembrane domain (TM) hosts the autotransport function, also called type V secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. During this process, the passenger domain (PSD) is exported to the bacterial cell surface through a pore formed by the TM, with the assistance of periplasmic chaperones and the &#x003b2;-barrel assembly machinery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Although classical autotransporters comprise one polypeptide with a signal peptide, a PSD at the N-terminus of the mature protein, and a C-terminal TM, trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAAs) form homotrimeric structures with a common N-terminus&#x02013;head&#x02013;stalk&#x02013;TM&#x02013;C-terminus architecture after eliminating a signal peptide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The TM, which is formed by a 12-stranded &#x003b2;-barrel (four strands from each polypeptide&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;three polypeptides) at the outer membrane (OM), anchors the head&#x02013;stalk domain, the PSD of TAAs, to the OM, after secreting it through the &#x003b2;-barrel pore. The PSDs are assembled from a set of analogous, structurally conserved domains, and the evolutionary rearrangement of these domains has resulted in considerable diversity in the configuration and length of PSDs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Most TAAs have been reported to be involved in the initial attachment of bacterial cells to host cells and/or extracellular matrix proteins, as well as in autoagglutination, colonization, biofilm formation, and serum resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The TAAs in <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species are currently attracting attention for their ability to drive actin-based motility in host cells by mimicking host actin polymerases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The PSDs are responsible for these biological functions.</p><p>AtaA, a TAA from the nonpathogenic toluene-degrading bacterium <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp. Tol 5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, has unique adhesive properties that are not shared by other reported TAAs; AtaA mediates strikingly tenacious, nonspecific adhesion of the bacterial cells to abiotic surfaces and has dramatically high autoagglutination ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Through AtaA&#x02019;s adhesive properties, large clumps of the bacterial cells are rapidly immobilized onto various material surfaces, ranging from hydrophobic plastics to hydrophilic glass and stainless steel, in a manner independent of cell growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. A novel and highly efficient method for microbial cell immobilization using AtaA has been developed, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. AtaA is composed of 3,630 amino acids and is one of the largest TAAs reported to date, with a long PSD consisting of mosaically arranged multiple domain repeats that often appear in the TAA family and are annotated by the daTAA program<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. These domain repeats include two Ylheads, 12 Trp-rings, eight DALL1s, five FGG motifs, and several neck domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. This long PSD forms the long stalk of the AtaA nanofiber, which extends for more than 200&#x02009;nm on the Tol 5 cell surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. To unravel the mechanism of the striking adhesive properties of AtaA, direct characterization of the AtaA molecule using purified protein is indispensable. The effects of other factors, including the surface charge and hydrophobicity of cells and other nanofibers on the cell surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, can be eliminated using purified protein. However, it is virtually impossible to produce the entire multi-domain AtaA membrane protein as a recombinant protein in a correctly folded state. Alternatively, extensive experiments would be required to find a suitable method for disruption of the membrane envelope and to select the optimum surfactant for the purification of full-length, native AtaA from Tol 5 cells.</p><p>In contrast with TAAs, which are anchored to the OM, many classical autotransporters release their PSDs into the extracellular space by proteolytic cleavage, using either autoproteolytic activity or a membrane-bound protease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Furthermore, heterologous passenger proteins fused to the TMs of classical autotransporters have been released to the external environment by OmpT protease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. An OmpT protease recognition site was also inserted at the fusion site of a heterologous epitope with the TM to release the heterologous passenger polypeptide by proteolytic cleavage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p><p>Here, we show the first example of applying proteolytic cleavage to a TAA for the isolation of its PSD. A specific protease site was artificially introduced to obtain the full-length extracellular portion of AtaA, which forms nanofibers. Long AtaA PSD nanofibers were successfully reaped directly from the cell surface and used to characterize the AtaA molecule.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Molecular engineering to obtain the AtaA passenger domain from the cell surface</title><p>We designed an isolation method that enables reaping of the PSD nanofiber directly from the cell surface by cleaving the AtaA protein at the base of the PSD using a protease with high specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). According to the annotation provided by the daTAA program, AtaA has five FGG motifs, which are numbered from the N-terminus of AtaA (FGG_1 to FGG_5); FGG_5 is situated at the N-terminal side adjacent to the TM. A previously determined X-ray crystal structure that included FGG_5 (PDB ID&#x02009;=&#x02009;3WPA) showed that it has a tri-glycine loop exposed on the molecular surface of the fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. We selected a position between the leucine residue and the tri-glycine residues in this FGG motif to insert the protease cleavage site so as to form an expanded flexible loop. By digesting at this position, 98.5% of the full-length fiber of the trimeric AtaA PSD, which contains 3428 amino acids in each polypeptide, would be reaped from the cell surface. It is 1016&#x02009;kDa as the trimer based on the calculated molecular weight and has a theoretical isoelectric point of 4.76. For the site-specific cleavage of the PSD, we selected human rhinovirus 3C (HRV 3C) protease, which recognizes a unique amino acid sequence with high specificity. A nucleotide sequence encoding the protease recognition site and a tri-glycine linker was inserted into the full-length <italic>ataA</italic> gene at the target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The resultant recombinant DNA encoding the modified AtaA (3CAtaA) was used to transform the &#x00394;<italic>ataA</italic> mutant strain Tol 5 4140<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> for its exclusive expression. Production of 3CAtaA protein and its cell-surface display were analyzed by immunoblotting and flow cytometry, respectively. Immunoblotting analysis of the whole-cell lysates demonstrated the production of 3CAtaA protein in Tol 5 4140 (p3CataA) cells with induction of <italic>3CataA</italic> gene expression by arabinose (3C+) but not in the cells without the induction (3C&#x02212;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis using cells stained with anti-AtaA antiserum revealed that Tol 5 4140 (p3CataA) cells with induction of <italic>3CataA</italic> gene expression exhibited a shift of the histogram toward the stronger fluorescent side, implying much 3CAtaA protein displayed on the cell surface, compared with even surface display of AtaA protein on Tol 5 wild-type cells. The functionality of 3CAtaA protein on the cell was examined by adherence assays using polystyrene (PS) and glass plates. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>, cells expressing 3CAtaA (3C+) exhibited higher adhesion to both material surfaces than not only cells without expressing <italic>3CAtaA</italic> (3C&#x02212;) but also Tol 5 wild-type cells expressing the original AtaA, due to higher expression of 3CataA from the plasmid than that of AtaA from the genome. These results verified that 3CAtaA was properly displayed on the cell surface and kept the adhesiveness of the original AtaA in spite of the insertion of the HRV 3C recognition site.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reaping AtaA PSD nanofibers from the cell surface by proteolytic cleavage</title><p>Tol 5 4140 transformant cells, which express 3CAtaA, were treated with HRV 3C protease to specifically cleave AtaA present on the cell surface. After the proteolytic digestion, the cells were harvested by centrifugation to examine the cleavage efficiency, and the supernatant was collected for the purification of AtaA PSD released in the reaction buffer. The cells treated with or without the protease were stained with anti-AtaA antiserum and observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). As shown in insets of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>,B, treatment of protease drastically reduced the fluorescence of the cells, implying effective cleavage of AtaA displayed on the cells. For more quantitative evaluation of the proteolytic cleavage efficiency, we performed flow cytometric analysis using the same samples as used for CLSM. The protease treatment reduced the percentage of the fluorescent labeled cells displaying 3CAtaA from 73.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>) to 17.1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Therefore, the cleavage efficiency was calculated to be 77%.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>, AtaA PSD could be recovered from the supernatant of the sample treated with the protease but could not be recovered from the control sample that did not undergo protease treatment. However, other proteins were present as contaminants in the supernatant, even though it contained mainly AtaA PSD. For further purification, the proteins in the supernatant were precipitated in the 30% solution of the saturated concentration of ammonium sulfate. The majority of the AtaA PSD was recovered in the precipitate with high purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). To confirm that the AtaA PSD recovered from the precipitate was dissociated from the OM, a sample was subjected to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, which has been used to purify the OM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Upon fractionation on a 5&#x02013;50% sucrose density gradient, the purified AtaA PSD was found mainly in the fraction with a density of 1.060&#x02009;g/mL. Little AtaA was detected in the high-density fractions or in the bottom fraction, where OM should have been distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Thus, AtaA PSD could be isolated <italic>en bloc</italic> from the surface of cells displaying 3CAtaA by proteolytic digestion with HRV 3C protease and could be purified simply by ammonium sulfate fractionation. The AtaA PSD protein in the sample after ammonium sulfate fractionation was concentrated by ultrafiltration with a 100-kDa cut-off filter. We ultimately obtained 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of purified AtaA PSD from 20&#x02009;mL of culture solution.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Morphological characteristics of the purified AtaA passenger domain</title><p>Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis was performed to confirm that the purified AtaA PSD maintained its trimeric structure. DLS analysis is often used to determine the size and molecular weight of protein. The molecular weight of the AtaA PSD, modeled as a linear polymer, was estimated to be 1071&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;138&#x02009;kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>, Peak1). This value almost coincides with the value (1016&#x02009;kDa) calculated using its constituent amino acids. A peak detected at very high molecular mass might reflect the aggregation of AtaA PSD molecules in the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>, Peak2).</p><p>We next analyzed the morphological characteristics of AtaA PSD using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Many nanofibrous structures were observed in the fraction of purified AtaA PSD. AtaA PSD nanofibers were uniform in size, at 225&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.7&#x02009;nm in length and 4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4&#x02009;nm in thickness (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SEM of 10 fibers, chosen at random), were curved in places, and had two globular structures: one at the fiber tip and the other near the opposite end (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1 and S2</xref>). The former globular structure was predicted to correspond to the globular tip of the AtaA nanofiber, that is, N-terminal Ylhead (Nhead). To confirm the topological direction of the nanofibers observed, we constructed another modified AtaA, 3CFGG2AtaA, in which a HRV 3C protease recognition site was inserted at FGG_2 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). After proteolytic cleavage, a shorter version of the AtaA PSD fiber (AtaA PSD short), which did not include the C-terminal Ylhead (Chead), was obtained. TEM revealed that AtaA PSD short fibers were 180&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.8&#x02009;nm in length (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SEM of six fibers, chosen at random), had only one globular structure at the fiber tip, and lost the other globular structure (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). These data suggest that the globular structures at the fiber tip and near the opposite end corresponded to Nhead and Chead, respectively. The TEM image of a single-molecule fiber of AtaA PSD was then aligned to the predicted domain configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Biophysical and biochemical characterization of the AtaA passenger domain</title><p>The effects of temperature and pH on the structure of AtaA PSD were examined by measuring the circular dichroism (CD) spectra. CD is commonly used to estimate the secondary structure of protein. This measurement is widely used to determine the stability of the structure of a protein in various physicochemical conditions. After incubation of AtaA PSD dissolved in deionized water (dH<sub>2</sub>O) at temperatures 25&#x02013;98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02009;min, CD spectra were measured at a room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The CD spectrum of the native AtaA PSD exhibited two negative peaks at 209 and 222&#x02009;nm that were attributed to &#x003b1;-helices, and one negative peak at 218&#x02009;nm that was attributed to &#x003b2;-strands; their contents in this intact AtaA PSD were 31% and 10%, respectively. The AtaA PSD treated at 70 and 80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C showed CD spectra with only small differences from native AtaA PSD at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. However, the CD spectrum of AtaA PSD changed drastically after incubation at temperatures over 90&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; The CD signals became weaker, implying the disruption of secondary structures. The ellipticity of the CD peak at 222&#x02009;nm gradually decreased with increasing temperature below 70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, but it drastically decreased above 80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, reflecting the disruption of secondary structures within AtaA PSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Next, to examine the effect of pH, the CD spectra of AtaA PSD dissolved in buffers at different pH or in 0.1&#x02009;M HCl (pH 1.0) were directly measured. The CD spectra of all samples at pHs from 2 to 12, and even in 0.1&#x02009;M HCl, almost overlapped, implying that the secondary structure of AtaA PSD is mostly unaffected by pH change in this range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the morphological changes that occurred in AtaA PSD nanofibers using the same samples used for CD spectroscopy after thermal or pH treatment. TEM revealed no morphological changes resulting from the treatment at 80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, relative to the morphology in the control treated at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. However, the fibrous structure of AtaA PSD shrank, shortened, and was difficult to observe upon thermal treatment at 90 and 98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>), which correspond to temperatures that caused drastic changes in the CD spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A,B</xref>). Apparent disruption of the fiber structure was not observed for any pH conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>), as expected from the unchanged CD spectra under acidic and alkaline conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Even in 0.1&#x02009;M HCl, AtaA PSD maintained a distinctly visible fiber morphology, as well as its secondary structure, although bent fibers were observed.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Functional analysis of the AtaA passenger domain</title><p>Obtaining purified AtaA PSD allowed us to directly measure the interaction of the protein molecule with a surface. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is a highly sensitive and label-free mass measurement sensor, which enables quantifying molecules interacting with a quartz crystal sensor chip as a frequency change. We examined the adhesiveness of intact and denatured AtaA PSD using QCM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>, the resonance frequency rapidly declined with time when AtaA PSD pre-treated at 25 or 70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C was applied to the QCM sensor. This implies the rapid adhesion of protein molecules to the sensor chip surface. In contrast, the decline in the resonance frequency was faint when bovine serum albumin was applied, emphasizing the stickiness of AtaA PSD. The decline in resonance frequency decreased with increasing treatment temperature for denaturation of the protein molecules and became faint at 98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The bar chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref> shows the frequency change (dF) caused by the adhesion of protein molecules to the QCM sensor when the frequency-shift curve became almost flat (10&#x02009;min). The absolute value of the dF was almost the same after incubation at 70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C as it was at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; it suddenly diminished at 80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, gradually diminished with increasing treatment temperature, and became very small at 98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, implying that adhesiveness was almost lost in AtaA PSD that was denatured at the high temperature. However, treatment with acidic or alkaline solution did not affect its adhesiveness to the QCM sensor chip at all, and thus the dF remained the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>). These QCM data suggest that AtaA&#x02019;s high adhesiveness to an abiotic surface requires its structural integrity. To determine whether the heat denaturation that causes the loss of adhesiveness degrades the AtaA polypeptide itself, AtaA PSD samples after thermal treatment were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This revealed that the molecular sizes of the monomers in these AtaA PSD samples were unchanged, implying no degradation of the polypeptide by thermal treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). Therefore, loss of the adhesive function of AtaA PSD must have been caused by disruption of the 3D structure of the protein.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>TAAs have most often been studied using fragmented recombinant proteins expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> or using bacterial cells expressing intrinsic or foreign TAAs on their cell surfaces<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. These studies have uncovered the structure and function of TAAs. However, their molecular properties remain unclear because the properties of a fragmented recombinant protein do not always reflect those of the native, full-length molecule. By contrast, proteins isolated using our enzymatic reaping method are guaranteed to be properly folded and assembled because they are actual parts of the native protein secreted by the original carrier cells. As for classical autotransporters that release their PSDs into the extracellular space, PSDs purified from culture supernatants have been used for biochemical characterization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> or determination of their crystal structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, however, the artificial insertion of a protease recognition site into an autotransporter has never been employed to obtain PSDs for their characterization. In this study, we first inserted a protease recognition site into a TAA to isolate its PSD by proteolytic cleavage, and then we purified the native PSD proteins from the extracellular space. The expected molecular weight from DLS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>) suggested that the AtaA PSD purified by this method appropriately formed a trimer. TEM revealed its nanofibrous structure, which corresponded to the predicted domain configuration having two globular Ylhead domains at the N-terminus of the distal end of the fiber (Nhead) and the C-terminal region near the fiber base (Chead), and a long stalk between the two Ylheads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The Chead was not reasonably found on the AtaA PSD short fiber (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). These results demonstrate that AtaA PSD was cleaved by HRV 3C protease at the inserted protease recognition site, as designed. The fibrous morphology of the AtaA PSD molecules was disrupted and became difficult to recognize when the AtaA PSD molecules were denatured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). TEM images of the AtaA PSD obviously changed after incubation of the protein at temperatures over 90&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, but were unchanged after incubation at temperatures lower than 80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. When the temperature exceeded 80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, the CD spectrum changed drastically and the ellipticity at 222&#x02009;nm indicated that the &#x003b1;-helix content decreased sharply, implying drastic denaturation of the protein that resulted in the disruption of its fibrous structure.</p><p>In denaturation studies, AtaA PSD showed high structural stability under conditions of extreme pH. It was reported that TAAs maintain their trimeric structure under the standard sample preparation conditions used for SDS-PAGE, and that dissociation into monomers requires boiling in 6&#x02013;10&#x02009;M urea solution, 95% formic acid, or extraction with hot phenol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Compared with the other TAAs reported in these articles, AtaA does not seem so resistant to high temperatures. However, it should be noted that the AtaA PSD does not contain a TM, which is important for trimer stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Nevertheless, AtaA PSD showed thermal stability that is considerably higher than that of typical proteins. Recently, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the C-terminal PSD of AtaA, which exhibits the toughness of AtaA nanofibers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The crystal structure revealed that interchain interactions of the three polypeptides forming the trimer, especially topological chain exchange, contribute to the toughness, which also should give the AtaA PSD high stability. The high stability is also significant for utilization of AtaA in our newly developed method for microbial immobilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The robustness due to the stability is expected to become an advantage in bioprocesses for industrial use.</p><p>QCM measurements revealed that AtaA PSD denatured by thermal treatment at high temperatures considerably decreased its adhesiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>). By contrast, alkaline and acid treatments did not affect the adhesiveness of AtaA PSD at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>). However, the heat denaturation that caused the loss of adhesiveness did not degrade the AtaA polypeptide itself (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>); only the higher-order structure was disrupted. These results lead us to conclude that the 3D structure is essential for the AtaA molecule to exhibit its unique adhesive character. The uniqueness of the adhesive character of AtaA is its nonspecific interactions, which have no specific ligand. In specific interactions, the stereostructure of the binding site for the ligand of a protein is important. In fact, TAAs require stable trimer formation to exhibit specific adhesion to host cells and tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. In contrast, nonspecific interactions do not necessarily require such precise stereostructures. Generally speaking, unfolded polypeptides are believed to exhibit nonspecific adhesiveness or a broad binding specificity due to their disordered structures, which allow enlargement of the capture radius and surface exposure of amino acid residues, depending on surface properties. Especially, large polypeptides are thought to be sticky due to multipoint adsorption on an extensive interface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. It has been speculated that the huge size of AtaA is responsible for its high adhesiveness. This idea was ruled out by the results showing that AtaA PSD almost completely lost its adhesive character after treatment at 98&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, despite maintaining the full length of the polypeptide. It should be stressed that maintaining a proper 3D fiber structure is crucially important for the high, nonspecific adhesiveness of the AtaA molecule, and that the adhesiveness cannot be achieved from the large size of the protein alone.</p><p>In conclusion, we established a methodology that uses specific protease digestion to prepare the very large PSD of AtaA while retaining its native properties. We observed, for the first time, the molecular shape of purified AtaA PSD and found that its fibrous structure has high stability in strict pH conditions. The 3D structure forming this fiber is necessary for AtaA PSD to exhibit its nonspecific adhesiveness.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp.
