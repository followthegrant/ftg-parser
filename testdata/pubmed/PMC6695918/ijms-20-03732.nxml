Introduction</title><p>Adenosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.20, ADK) is the most important enzyme in adenosine metabolism. It is one of the most common and abundant nucleoside kinases [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The protein sequence of ADK is conserved among several eukaryotic species [<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. ADK is the first enzyme in the adenosine remediation pathway, and an important regulator of extracellular adenosine concentration [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which has been well elucidated in animal models of epilepsy and ischemia [<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. ADK was first isolated from yeast in 1951. In the past decades, ADK properties including substrate specificity [<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], inhibitors [<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], metal ions [<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], ATP, and inorganic phosphate [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have been extensively investigated.</p><p>In 1998, the first crystal structure of human ADK was resolved [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. ADK contains two domains, one being a large &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; domain and the other, a small cap domain. The large domain is composed of nine &#x003b2;-strands and eight &#x003b1;-helices, providing an appropriate environment for the specific binding of ATP and adenosine. The small domain is composed of five &#x003b2;-strands and two &#x003b1;-helices acting as a lid on the top of the activation center. The domains are connected by four peptides, and adenosine as the substrate binds in the cleft formed by the two domains. The nucleotide binding sites are located in the groove of the catalytic domain [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In 2000, the crystal structure of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> adenosine kinase revealed a different catalytic mechanism which involves a rotation of the catalytic domain and the formation of an anion hole mediated by ATP binding and a conformational change from &#x003b1;-helix to random coil [<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Compared to human ADK, the ADK of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mt) is greatly different [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although both of them are composed of a large domain and a small lid-like domain, MtADK shares less than 20% sequence identity with that of human ADK. The key difference between MtADK and human ADK is that MtADK is a functional homodimer, but the active formation of human ADK is a monomer [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The function of ADK is to maintain the balance of adenosine concentration in cells by phosphorylation of adenosine. As a result, any change in enzymatic activity can trigger a large number of physiological diseases. In transgenic mice lacking ADK, the newborn mice have abnormal temperature control, and deaths occur on the fourth day. On the eighth day, the mortality rate is as high as 88%. The livers of the dead mice display obvious lesions, and the content of intermediate products in methyl transfer reactions such as <italic>S</italic>-adenosylhomocysteine and <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine increases, indicating that ADK is involved in the methylation reaction pathway [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. ADK activity is reduced by 40&#x02013;50% in diabetes models, and its transcription level is also reduced by 50%. However, the recovery of ADK activity promotes the proliferation of t-lymphocytes [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The inhibition of ADK activity by specific inhibitors significantly prevents the occurrence of inflammation [<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and promotes the growth of liver cancer cells, whereas the activation of ADK expression promotes the growth of colorectal cancer cells [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p><italic>Bombyx mori</italic> is a kind of <italic>Lepidoptera</italic> model insect with high economic value. Although ADK has been extensively studied for decades, the biochemical properties, structure, and biological role of ADK from the silkworm (BmADK) are largely unknown. Here, we expressed and purified the recombinant BmADK protein and its variants in vitro, and studied its activity, structure, cellular localization, and potential roles in the silkworm. Our study advanced a better understanding of the enzymatic activity, structure, and biological role of ADK.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-20-03732"><title>2.

Bioinformatic Analysis, Expression, and Purification of BmADK</title><p>To characterize the properties and structure of BmADK, we carried out a bioinformatic analysis. The result showed that BmADK is composed of 1050 bp and encodes 349 amino acids. Its theoretical pI was predicted to be 5.13, and the theoretical molecular weight was 38 kDa. Secondary structure prediction showed that BmADK contained a large number of &#x003b1;-helix and &#x003b2;-strand structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f001">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>BmADK was purified after heterologous expression by Ni-NTA affinity column and gel filtration chromatography.

Influence of Mutations on Enzymatic Activity</title><p>To further obtain the structural and activity information of BmADK, the site-directed mutagenesis of five conserved amino acid residues was performed. We obtained G68A, S201A, S201R, S201D, E229A, E229R, G280A, G280D, and D303A mutants and examined their enzymatic activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f003">Figure 3</xref>A shows a comparison of the BmADK mutants&#x02019; activity with that of WT BmADK.

The results showed that the mutations had different effects on the secondary structure of BmADK. S201R, S201D, and E229R caused a significant decrease in the &#x003b1;-helix content of BmADK, whereas S201A increased the &#x003b1;-helix content of BmADK.

Here, only one form of BmADK was identified in the silkworm genome base, which is different from ADKs in mammalian ADKs. Moreover, the similar motif in mammalian ADKs responding for nuclear localization signal could not be found in the sequence of BmADK, indicating that BmADK may not be detected in the cellular nuclei. Our result showed BmADK was located in the cytoplasm of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f004">Figure 4</xref>C), which is consistent with our previous prediction from the sequence comparison. Unlike the cellular location of mammalian ADKs in the nucleus, therefore, BmADK is not likely involved in the process of methyl transfer [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The mutations of G280A and G280D had no significant influence on the enzymatic activity compared with that of WT, indicating that it was not a key amino acid for enzymatic activity. CD analysis showed G280A and G280D had similar secondary structures with that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). G68 and G69 of BmADK (G63 and G64 of human ADK) are conserved in different organisms. According to human ADK structure, the big domain and the small lid-like domain are connected by four loops as the hinge, which create the reaction cavity for adenosine. The conformation of the catalytic center is further stabilized by adenosine molecules [<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The activity of G68A was approximately 70% of BmADK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f003">Figure 3</xref>B), implying that G68 of BmADK, like G63 of human ADK, was also located in the hinge. The mutation of G68A induced a slight increase in the &#x003b1;-helix content of BmADK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f003">Figure 3</xref>C), which likely affected the interaction between the big domain and the small lid-like domain, thus leading to conformational change of the catalytic center. Although G68A mutation reduced BmADK activity, it did not cause complete inactivation of BmADK since glycine (G) and alanine (A) are very similar in structure.</p><p>In human ADK, S198, E226, and D300 (S201, E229, and D303 of BmADK) are involved in substrate binding and catalytic reaction [<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. D300 is an important catalytic residue which bridges Mg<sup>2+</sup> and O5&#x02032;-hydroxyl of adenosine. In the catalytic reaction, the O5&#x02032;-hydroxyl donates a hydrogen bond to D300 and accepts a hydrogen bond from a water molecule, which forms a hydrogen bond to another water molecule. This water molecule is a part of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination sphere [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. D303A mutation resulted in the decrease in the &#x003b1;-helix content of BmADK and the loss of BmADK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f003">Figure 3</xref>B,D), which likely alters the conformation of the catalytic center and prevents alanine from acting as an acceptor of hydrogen bonds, thus affecting the catalytic reaction. E226 is involved in ADP/ATP binding and coordinating Mg<sup>2+</sup> and absolutely conserved in different species [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, the mutations of E229A and E229R prevent alanine (A) and arginine (R) from forming proper hydrogen bonds with the substrate. In addition, E229A and E229R changed the &#x003b1;-helix content of BmADK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f003">Figure 3</xref>D), thus affecting the conformation of the catalytic center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). As a result, the enzyme was deactivated completely by the mutations of E229A and E229R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). The &#x003b1;-helix content of E229R was less than that of E229A. The possible reason is that R has a negative charge side group, whereas E has a positive charge side group. The opposite charge mutation (E-&#x0003e;R) changes the environment more significantly than the mutation E-&#x0003e;A, thus further resulting in the decrease in the &#x003b1;-helix content and catalytic activity of BmADK.</p><p>Intriguingly, the mutants S201A, S201D, and S201R showed different activity. S201R and S201D completely abolished BmADK activity; however, S201A significantly enhanced its enzymatic activity when compared with that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Compared to serine, arginine (R) and aspartic acid (D) have a longer charged R-group. The R-group of alanine (A) is shorter than that of serine and lacks a polar hydroxyl group. CD spectra showed that the &#x003b1;-helix content of S201A was significantly increased when compared to that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). Thus, the increase in S201A activity suggested that the mutation of S-&#x0003e;A may ensure the stability of the reaction center conformation and provide a favorable environment for the binding of substrate and the reaction. On the contrary, the &#x003b1;-helix contents of S201D and S201R were significantly decreased when compared to that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). As a result, the activity loss of S201D and S201R could be ascribed to the mutations of S-&#x0003e;D and S-&#x0003e;R, respectively, which may disrupt the stability of the catalytic center conformation and change its conformation. Additionally, the replacement of the hydroxyl group (S) with a long-chain and charged R-group (D/R) could form steric hindrance, which is not favorable for the entrance and binding of substrate. Our results suggested that S201 is a key amino acid for the enzymatic activity of BmADK. The analysis on BmADK mutants provides us more knowledge about the relationship of ADK activity and its structure. In particular, the increase in S201A activity directs a new approach to regulate ADK activity and explore its biological role related to ADK dysfunction, disease, and cancer.</p><p><italic>BmADK</italic> was highly expressed in the silk glands at the pre-pupal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f004">Figure 4</xref>B), indicating that it might be related to the metamorphosis of silkworm larvae into the pupa. At this stage, cell apoptosis and autophagy occur in silk gland cells to regulate silk gland degeneration [<xref rid="B28-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

In fruit flies and silkworm, the degradation of intestines and silk glands is regulated by 20E signaling [<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. qRT-PCR showed that the expression of <italic>Br-C</italic>, <italic>Ec-R</italic>, and <italic>E74A</italic> genes related to 20E signaling was significantly reduced after RNAi of <italic>BmADK</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f005">Figure 5</xref>D&#x02013;F), indicating that <italic>BmADK</italic> is likely associated with 20E signaling pathway.

This novel role of <italic>BmADK</italic> in silkworm is different from previous reports of mammalian ADKs including regulating methylation pathway [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], promoting t-lymphocytes proliferation [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and inflammation [<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and promoting liver cancer cell proliferation [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-03732" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which will advance a better understanding of ADK and its biological role.</p><p>It was noted that although silencing of <italic>BmADK</italic> was significant, more than half of the transcript was still present and not silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03732-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Therefore, BmADK was most likely still produced, although to a lower amount. As a result, the transcriptions of <italic>ATG 8</italic>, <italic>Caspase-9</italic>, <italic>Ec-R</italic>, <italic>E74A</italic>, and <italic>Br-C</italic> were downregulated temporarily, and then recovered to normal levels after the disappearance of the RNAi effect.
