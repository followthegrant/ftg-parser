The plasma membrane-bound carboxypeptidase activity which occurs at neutral optimum pH levels was found to be enhanced by CoCl<sub>2</sub> and inhibited by guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, <italic>o</italic>-phenanthroline, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and cadmium acetate; whereas the soluble carboxypeptidase activity which occurs at an optimum pH level of 5.0 was not activated by CoCl<sub>2</sub> and only slightly inhibited by <italic>o</italic>-phenanthroline, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, NiCl<sub>2</sub> and CdCl<sub>2</sub>. The latter activity was presumably due to lysosomal cathepsin B, which is known to be present in the soluble fraction of hog intestinal mucosa. Although the membrane-bound enzyme was evenly distributed along the small intestine, it was not anchored in the phospholipidic bilayer via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moiety, as carboxypeptidase M from human placenta is. The enzyme was not solubilized by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, but was solubilized to practically the same extent by several detergents. The purified trypsin-solubilized form is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 200 kDa, as determined by performing SDS&#x02013;PAGE and gel filtration, which differs considerably from the molecular mass of human placental carboxypeptidase M (62 kDa). It was found to cleave lysyl bonds more rapidly than arginyl bonds, which is not so in the case of carboxypeptidase M, and immunoblotting analysis provided further evidence that hog intestinal and human placental membrane-bound carboxypeptidases do not bear much resemblance to each other. Since the latter enzyme has been called carboxypeptidase M, it is suggested that the former might be carboxypeptidase D, the recently described new member of the carboxypeptide B-type family.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Carboxypeptidase</kwd><kwd>Membrane-bound protein</kwd><kwd>Metalloprotein</kwd><kwd>(Hog intestine)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>AMC, 4-methyl-7-coumarylamide</kwd><kwd>CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate</kwd><kwd>CMC, critical micellar concentration</kwd><kwd>CP, carboxypeptidase</kwd><kwd>DTT, dithiothreitol</kwd><kwd>EDTA, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid</kwd><kwd>FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography</kwd><kwd>GEMSA, guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid</kwd><kwd>GPI, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol</kwd><kwd>HEPES, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethanesulfonic acid</kwd><kwd>HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography</kwd><kwd>MDCK, Madin Darby canine kidney</kwd><kwd>NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</kwd><kwd>octyl-glucoside, <italic>n</italic>-octyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside</kwd><kwd>PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis</kwd><kwd>PCMS, <italic>p</italic>-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate</kwd><kwd>PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C</kwd><kwd>PITC, phenylisothiocyanate</kwd><kwd>PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride</kwd><kwd>PTC, phenylthiocarbamyl</kwd><kwd>PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride</kwd><kwd>RNA, ribonucleic acid</kwd><kwd>SDS, sodium dodecyl sulfate</kwd><kwd>TFA, trifluoroacetic acid</kwd><kwd>TLCK, <italic>N</italic><sup>&#x003b1;</sup>-<italic>p</italic>-tosyl-<sc>l</sc>-lysine chloromethylketone</kwd><kwd>Tris, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane</kwd><kwd>Z, benzyloxycarbonyl</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section.0010"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="para.0010">Basic carboxypeptidases are metallo-enzymes which cleave COOH-terminal arginine and lysine from peptides and proteins. They occur widely among mammals, and the secretory pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (CPB) is generally taken to be the most representative member of this class of enzymes <xref rid="BIB1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although pancreatic CPB is responsible for the intestinal digestion of food proteins and peptides, the other basic carboxypeptidases are not digestive enzymes but have regulatory effects on the activity of biological peptides such as anaphylatoxins, enkephalins and bradykinins <xref rid="BIB1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Since all the mammalian basic carboxypeptidases have similar enzymatic activities, they may play different roles in vivo, depending on their localization and physical properties.</p><p id="para.0015">Human plasma CPN (which is also known as kininase I) is synthesized in the liver and released into the bloodstream in the form of a large tetrameric complex (280 kDa) containing two active subunits (48&#x02013;55 kDa) and two inactive glycosylated subunits (83 kDa), the latter of which stabilize the active ones and keep them in the solubilized form <xref rid="BIB2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Since CPN has mainly been found in circulating blood, its most likely function seems to be to protect the organism from the action of potent vasoactive and inflammatory peptides such as kinins and/or anaphylatoxins <xref rid="BIB1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A plasma pro-CPB of hepatic origin which is structurally similar to pancreatic pro-CPB has recently been identified as a circulating protein, isolated from the blood, and found to form a non-covalent association with other plasma proteins <xref rid="BIB5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Unlike pancreatic CPB, which has a purely digestive function, plasma CPB might be involved in fibrinolysis and has been defined as a thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, or TAFI <xref rid="BIB7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p id="para.0020">CPH, which is also known as CPE or enkephalin convertase, is located in the secretory granules of pancreatic islets, as well as in the adrenal and pituitary glands and brain <xref rid="BIB9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, where it is present in both the soluble and membrane-bound forms <xref rid="BIB14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This enzyme differs from the other basic carboxypeptidases in that it has an acidic optimum pH, which is consistent with the acidic interior of the granules <xref rid="BIB16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. CPH is probably involved in the removal of residual COOH-terminal arginine or lysine residues from peptidic prohormones during their processing in secretory granules <xref rid="BIB1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Another recently discovered enzyme, CPD, which has similar characteristics but a different molecular mass, may also be involved in the processing of the peptides and proteins that transit via the secretory pathway <xref rid="BIB19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p id="para.0025">CPM is a widely distributed membrane-bound basic carboxypeptidase which has been purified to homogeneity, cloned and sequenced from human placenta <xref rid="BIB21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, where it is attached to the plasma membrane via a phosphatidylinositol glycan tail <xref rid="BIB23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In view of its presence in plasma membranes and the fact that its optimal activity occurs at neutral pH levels, CPM might well participate in the local control of peptide hormone activity. Its proximity to plasma membrane receptors suggests that it may either inactivate or affect in some way the receptor specificity of peptide hormones released at local tissue sites <xref rid="BIB1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p id="para.0030">A novel cDNA encoding CPZ has recently been identified based on its homology with known metallocarboxypeptidases <xref rid="BIB24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. CPZ was expressed in the baculovirus system and found to be more active at neutral pH levels than at pH 5.5 toward substrates with COOH-terminal basic amino acids <xref rid="BIB24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Lastly, AEBP1 was identified as a transcription repressor showing some homologies with metallocarboxypeptidases. Although it lacks the residues on which carboxypeptidase activity is thought to depend, this enzymatic protein has been reported to cleave peptides containing a COOH-terminal arginine residue <xref rid="BIB25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p id="para.0035">The increasing number of data becoming available nowadays on biologically active peptides has led to considerable attention being paid to mammalian basic carboxypeptidases. Little is known so far, however, about these non-digestive basic carboxypeptidases located in the intestinal tract, although it has been reported that most of the CPH activity in the rat intestine is membrane-bound, based on the finding that it is stimulated by CoCl<sub>2</sub> and inhibited by low concentrations of guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid (GEMSA) at low pH levels <xref rid="BIB26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. CPM has the same properties as CPH <xref rid="BIB27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and the presence of both enzymes has been briefly described in the dog small intestinal wall <xref rid="BIB28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, but no further characterization has been performed. Here, we describe the purification procedure used and give some of the characteristics of the membrane-bound basic carboxypeptidase from hog intestine mucosa, an enzyme which definitely differs from the other known carboxypeptidases but which is similar in some respects to the newly described CPD, the mammalian homologous form of duck gp180 protein, a 180 kDa hepatitis B virus-binding glycoprotein.</p></sec><sec id="SEC1"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="section.0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p id="para.0040">Porcine intestines were obtained from the Marseilles slaughterhouse.

In the microvillar membrane fractions, the activity was highest at pH 7.5, and the enzyme was still 72% active at pH 9.0, whereas the activity dropped sharply at acidic pH levels and was practically nil below pH 4.5.

Hog intestinal basic CP showed the highest level of activity at pH 5.0 with the soluble enzyme, and was still 57% active at pH 3.0, but its activity dropped sharply at basic pH levels.

However, although the amino acid compositions of hog intestinal CP, human CPM, and human CPD are comparable, the exact identity of the intestinal enzyme still needs to be confirmed.<table-wrap position="float" id="TBL4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparative amino acid compositions of trypsin-solubilized hog intestinal membrane-bound basic CP and two other basic carboxypeptidases</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Amino acids</td><td>120 kDa protein<xref rid="TBLFN4A" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref> (%)</td><td>200 kDa protein<xref rid="TBLFN4A" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref> (%)</td><td>CPM<xref rid="TBLFN4B" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref> (%)</td><td>CPD<xref rid="TBLFN4C" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref> (%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td>Asx</td><td align="char">4.2</td><td align="char">12.3</td><td align="char">12.6</td><td align="char">11.2</td></tr><tr><td>Glx</td><td align="char">5.4</td><td align="char">9.7</td><td align="char">8.6</td><td align="char">9.8</td></tr><tr><td>Cys</td><td align="char">0.4</td><td align="char">0.5</td><td align="char">1.6</td><td align="char">1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Ser</td><td align="char">10.8</td><td align="char">9.2</td><td align="char">6.3</td><td align="char">7.9</td></tr><tr><td>Gly</td><td align="char">11.9</td><td align="char">9.7</td><td align="char">6.1</td><td align="char">7.9</td></tr><tr><td>His</td><td align="char">3.1</td><td align="char">3.1</td><td align="char">3.7</td><td align="char">3.3</td></tr><tr><td>Arg</td><td align="char">5.4</td><td align="char">5.1</td><td align="char">3.5</td><td align="char">4.6</td></tr><tr><td>Thr</td><td align="char">6.5</td><td align="char">6.1</td><td align="char">4.2</td><td align="char">6.5</td></tr><tr><td>Ala</td><td align="char">7.7</td><td align="char">7.2</td><td align="char">4.2</td><td align="char">6.0</td></tr><tr><td>Pro</td><td align="char">8.1</td><td align="char">6.1</td><td align="char">6.8</td><td align="char">5.8</td></tr><tr><td>Tyr</td><td align="char">5.4</td><td align="char">4.6</td><td align="char">5.9</td><td align="char">3.8</td></tr><tr><td>Val</td><td align="char">7.7</td><td align="char">6.7</td><td align="char">6.8</td><td align="char">6.8</td></tr><tr><td>Met</td><td align="char">2.3</td><td align="char">1.5</td><td align="char">2.1</td><td align="char">1.9</td></tr><tr><td>Ile</td><td align="char">5.4</td><td align="char">4.1</td><td align="char">5.6</td><td align="char">5.1</td></tr><tr><td>Leu</td><td align="char">9.6</td><td align="char">8.2</td><td align="char">9.6</td><td align="char">8.6</td></tr><tr><td>Phe</td><td align="char">5.0</td><td align="char">4.1</td><td align="char">4.7</td><td align="char">3.6</td></tr><tr><td>Lys</td><td align="char">1.1</td><td align="char">1.5</td><td align="char">6.8</td><td align="char">4.8</td></tr><tr><td>Trp</td><td align="char">n.d.</td><td align="char">n.d.</td><td align="char">1.2</td><td align="char">1.0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">Results are expressed as a percentage of total residues determined. n.d., not determined.</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TBLFN4A"><label>a</label><p>Mean value based on two analyses.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TBLFN4B"><label>b</label><p>Deduced from the cDNA nucleotide sequence of CPM <xref rid="BIB22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TBLFN4C"><label>c</label><p>Deduced from the cDNA nucleotide sequence of CPD <xref rid="BIB54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="section.0120"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="para.0185">The COOH-terminal arginine and lysine from peptides and proteins may be cleaved by several carboxypeptidases, which show the same pattern of carboxypeptidase B activity, but have different molecular and enzymatic characteristics <xref rid="BIB1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p id="para.0190">The results of the present study show that hog intestinal mucosa contains at least a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase capable of releasing basic COOH-terminal amino acids from short peptides. The trypsin-solubilized form of CP was isolated from the hog intestine, with a specific activity of 100 nmol/min per mg using hippuryl-<sc>l</sc>-Arg as the substrate. According to its subcellular localization and optimum pH, the enzyme activity greatly resembles that of CPM in the human placenta as well as that of MDCK cells <xref rid="BIB21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The basic CP activity was equally distributed between the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, in agreement with the pattern of distribution of CPH in the rat gastrointestinal tract <xref rid="BIB26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, since the methods used by the latter authors were not really specific to CPH activity <xref rid="BIB27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, the enzyme involved might have been CPM, and this might explain why CPH was sometimes found in areas apparently devoid of any endocrine function in the rat gastrointestinal tract. Although we observed that the ratio between intestinal membrane-bound and soluble CP activities was the same as that between membrane-bound and soluble CPH <xref rid="BIB26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, it is worth noting that two distinct enzymes with different optimum pH values and behavior towards activators and inhibitors were found to exist in hog intestine. The soluble CP activity was probably due to cathepsin B, a cysteine enzyme of lysosomal origin with several endo- and exopeptidase activities <xref rid="BIB51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB55" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> usually found in the gastroduodenal mucosa <xref rid="BIB56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. This enzyme, which is not a metallocarboxypeptidase, was not further characterized in this study.</p><p id="para.0195">Hog intestinal basic CP did not appear to have the characteristics of a GPI-anchored enzyme, judging from its pattern of solubilization by a range of detergents, in addition to the fact that it was not released from microvillar membrane preparations in response to PI-PLC. Consequently, this cell-surface peptidase is probably anchored by a sequence of hydrophobic amino acid residues to the lipid bilayer. The basic carboxypeptidases present in human and hog kidney microvillar membranes are known to have the same pattern of solubilization by detergents and to resist solubilization by PI-PLC <xref rid="BIB53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, whereas CPM from human placenta and that from MDCK cells are anchored via a GPI tail <xref rid="BIB23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The discovery in human placenta of a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase which was not GPI-anchored and had different characteristics from those of CPM <xref rid="BIB23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> may support the idea that membrane-bound CPM is not the sole microvillar carboxypeptidase. Since Hooper and Turner <xref rid="BIB53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> described the solubilization of basic CP from the rat kidney without further characterizing the enzyme, it is therefore possible that the microvillar membrane-bound carboxypeptidase is another member of the B-type carboxypeptidase family. A placental enzyme distinct from CPM was recently partially purified and denoted CPD <xref rid="BIB58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, a basic carboxypeptidase which was still unknown when the present work was carried out.</p><p id="para.0200">Although the basic CP from hog intestinal mucosa has some properties in common with CPM, it is definitely a distinct enzyme, since CPM is a GPI-anchored single-chain 60 kDa glycoprotein, whereas hog intestinal CP is apparently a single-chain 200 kDa glycoprotein which is anchored to the membrane by a number of hydrophobic amino acid residues. Moreover, intestinal CP cleaved lysyl bonds faster than arginyl bonds, contrary to CPM, and immunoblotting analysis provided further evidence that hog intestinal CP was different from CPM. The molecular mass of the intestinal CP (200 kDa) was not very different from that of the membrane-bound CPD (180 kDa), which was first described in the bovine pituitary gland as a CPH-like enzyme <xref rid="BIB19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. CPD is a widely distributed enzyme <xref rid="BIB20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> which has recently been partly purified from human placental microvilli <xref rid="BIB58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, indicating that CPM is not the sole microvillar carboxypeptidase of the B-type. The optimum pH of the purified intestinal CP was actually between 6.0 and 7.0, which is similar to that of human placental CPD (5.5&#x02013;6.5).</p><p id="para.0205">The sole membrane-bound CP which was isolated and characterized from hog intestine in the present study was identified as a new member of the B-type metallocarboxypeptidases, and is consequently different from CPB, CPN, pCPB, CPH and CPM. It appeared to be similar to the newly described CPD, which is the mammalian homologue of duck gp180, a 180 kDa hepatitis B virus-binding glycoprotein which was recently cloned and sequenced <xref rid="BIB59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. It is worth noting that unlike bovine CPD, the N-terminus of which was determined chemically <xref rid="BIB19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, no NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal residue could be detected when NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal Edman degradation was performed on the gp180 protein purified from duck liver <xref rid="BIB59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Although CPD occurs in a wide range of tissues, this is the first time a CPD-like enzyme is purified from intestinal tissue. Further characterization of the structural, catalytic and immunological properties of hog intestinal CP is still necessary to definitely confirm that this enzyme is a CPD.</p><p id="para.0210">As the various carboxypeptidases described so far have the same catalytic properties, their specific biological function must depend mainly on their site of action, which is generally directly related to their physical state (e.g., solubilized vs membrane-bound). It is therefore widely recognized that the pancreatic CPB present in the intestine in the form of a soluble enzyme contributes along with other digestive enzymes to degrading food proteins and peptides, whereas CPH in the secretory granules of neuroendocrine tissues might be involved in the maturation and sorting of peptidic hormones <xref rid="BIB60" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB61" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Two other carboxypeptidases present in most mammalian tissues and organs, namely CPN, which circulates in the blood, and CPM, which is bound to the plasma membrane of several cells, play key physiological roles, consisting of regulating the activity of various peptides. These two enzymes in particular have been described as kininases <xref rid="BIB62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, although their exact function has not yet been established. The function of CPD is still unknown, but the recent finding that it is located mainly in the trans-Golgi network is consistent with the idea that it is involved in the processing of a broad range of proteins that transit along the secretory pathway, playing a similar role to that of CPH in prohormone processing in the regulated secretory pathway <xref rid="BIB63" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. In addition, the finding that CPD is recycled from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi network constitutes important evidence supporting the suggestion that it may act as a receptor for hepatitis B virus <xref rid="BIB63" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Another metal containing peptidase, aminopeptidase N, has been found to be a coronavirus receptor <xref rid="BIB64" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="BIB65" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. The question as to whether the intestinal membrane-bound basic CP has a specific and exclusive degradative role completing that of pancreatic CPB, or is involved independently or concomitantly in the regulation of some of the active biological peptides present in the luminal secretions of the intestine, as well as in the immunological response of the intestinal mucosa to the presence of exogenous peptidic antigens, still remains to be elucidated.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliography.0010"><title>References</title><ref id="BIB1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Skidgel</surname><given-names>R.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Basic carboxypeptidases: regulators of peptide hormone activity</article-title><source>Trends Pharmacol.
