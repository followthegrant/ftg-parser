The crude incidence rate for 2014 has been estimated at 15.3 cases/100&#x02005;000 women. However, the prevalence varies in different Brazilian geographic regions and is higher in the North and Central-West.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Oral cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer among men in the Southeast and Northeast Brazilian regions (excluding non-melanoma skin tumours). In Brazil, in 2014, the incidence of oral cancer in men was 11.54 cases/100&#x02005;000, and in women it was 3.92/100&#x02005;000.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>The human papillomavirus (HPV) has been found to be a cause of premalignant and malignant tumours in the lower genital and digestive tracts.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> There are more than 100 HPV types,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and the most carcinogenic types affecting the cervix are the following: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> HPV infection accounts for more than 99% of cases of cervical cancer, whereas non-oncogenic HPV types, such as 6 and 11, are responsible for 90% of anogenital warts (papilloma).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> HPV is also associated with oropharyngeal cancer.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

Additionally, HPV vaccination in Brazil began in 2014, using the extended schedule (0, 6 and 60&#x02005;months), in girls aged 9&#x02013;13&#x02005;years. Understanding the prevalence of HPV prior to vaccination will be useful for monitoring the national vaccination programme's impact and evaluating changes in the differential regional distribution of HPV in Brazil.</p><p>Therefore, the primary objective of this systematic review will be to assess the prevalence of genito-anal area (cervical, penile and anal region) and oral HPV infection in the general population in Brazil. The secondary objective is to evaluate the prevalence of HPV infection in individuals with premalignant and malignant lesions in Brazil.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Protocol and registration</title><p>This systematic review protocol is prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary additional file 1</xref>).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This review protocol has been registered in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of systematic reviews (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO">http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO</ext-link>), registration number CRD42016032751.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011884.supp1</object-id><label>supplementary file 1</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-011884supp_file1.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Literature search</title><p>We will search the following databases: EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE, Web of Science and SciELO.

A Brazilian specialist in the area will be contacted to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. Additionally, we will use the website &#x02018;bancodeteses.capes.gov.br&#x02019; to identify dissertations in the area, and websites such as the Grey Literature Report (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.greylit.org">http://www.greylit.org</ext-link>) will be searched as grey literature. Additionally, the Department of IST/HIV has an extensive scientific network, and personal information from experts in the area will be personally gathered.

The following data will be collected: publication title, authors, publication year, study design, characteristics of the population (number of participants, age, gender, race, educational level, sexual history information, comorbidities and geographical region in Brazil), number of HPV-positive and HPV-negative women, HPV type, HPV detection and genotyping methodology, HPV vaccination history, HPV risk factors (ie, oral sex, multiple sexual partners) and the presence of HIV. For cohort and randomised studies, only the baseline characteristics of the population will be extracted. For systematic reviews, we will only scan the reference lists for additional studies. If the study is reported in duplicate, the study published earlier or the one that provides more information will be included.

When possible, data will be pooled using a meta-analytic approach. The random-effects model will be used to calculate pooled prevalence and corresponding 95% CI. If possible, the prevalence of HPV infection in Brazil will be adjusted, considering the population of each one of the five main Brazilian regions (North, Northeast, Centre-West, Southeast and South). The heterogeneity of the findings will be assessed using both the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. Sensitivity analysis will be performed by subgroup analyses and meta-regression to investigate the effect of study-level characteristics, such as age, gender, HPV type and methodological quality score, whenever possible. Publication bias across studies will be evaluated using funnel plots and Begg's tests. We will perform subgroup analysis for geographic area (Brazilian region), body region (cervical, penile, anal and oral regions), method of HPV assessment, HIV co-infection and the presence of premalignant or malignant lesions. If possible, we will also perform subgroup analyses for age, gender and HPV type. Studies in which the HPV type (high or low risk) was not assessed or was not reported will be excluded from the HPV type-specific analyses. A table with the characteristics of studies included will be used to present the results, and the GRADE approach will be used to assess the quality of the body of evidence. Analysis will be performed using R, V.3.2.3, packages meta V.4.3-2 and metaphor.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>

It is expected that the vaccination programme will decrease HPV infection and HPV-related cancer, improving healthcare and reducing healthcare costs. Prevalence studies are often used to plan public health actions and evaluate national control programmes. There are no HPV prevalence studies with a nationwide sample in Brazil. Single studies show heterogeneous results, assessing populations from different geographic areas, with different baseline risks and using diverse methods for HPV assessment.</p><p>The previous review on cervical HPV prevalence<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> published in Brazil in 2010 searched few databases, did not include the HIV-positive population and did not analyse premalignant and malignant lesions. Another review on oral HPV was published in 2015 but had language restrictions.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> No systematic review has been conducted to estimate the overall prevalence of HPV infection in Brazil.</p><p>With this systematic review, we expect to estimate the prevalence of HPV in Brazil, to identify gaps in the literature and to assess the need for a new original study with a nationwide sample. The results of this systematic review will be used to compare the prevalence of HPV in different geographical regions of the country as well as the characteristics of the studied populations.</p><p>However, it is unlikely that this systematic review will end with sufficient evidence on the national prevalence of HPV to provide adequate baseline data to monitor the effect of the Brazilian HPV vaccination programme over time. To meet the Brazilian Ministry of Health needs, we have already started a working group to design and conduct a nationwide study to determine the prevalence of HPV. The Prevalence of Papillomavirus in Brazil (POP-Brazil) study will investigate the prevalence of HPV infection in men and women aged 16&#x02013;25&#x02005;years, from primary healthcare units, in all state capital cities in Brazil. The present review will provide support for the development and organisation of the POP-Brazil study and show the gaps in the evaluation of HPV prevalence on a national magnitude.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Jeanine Rocha, who provided administrative support and edited the scientific language for reviewing this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> VC and EMW wrote the protocol.
