Within this spectrum, there are two broad classes: those that explicitly use discrete spikes, and those which use continuous scalar values to represent average firing rates. Within each class, disparate levels of description can co-exist; for example, in combining detailed conductance-based neurons and leaky-integrator neurons. However, there is a schism in signal representation between spiking and rate-coded models which means they are ostensibly incompatible with each other. Nevertheless, if we wish to understand how changes in cellular or microcircuit structure impact on the brain at a <italic>systems </italic>or behavioural level, then the ability to robustly unify models across this divide ('spikes and rates') will provide an invaluable tool, since systems models are often more appropriately built using rate-coded components. To address this, we developed a novel hybrid-modelling methodology in which the membrane potential of a spiking neuron is converted to an instantaneous measure of firing rate. This measure is based on the value of a 'conversion function' which is incremented by a fixed amount if the neuron fires, and decays exponentially otherwise.</p><p>The vehicle for investigating the hybrid approach was an existing rate-coded model of the basal ganglia whose properties are well-understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We replaced the leaky-integrator neurons in the striatum with Izhikevich neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], modulated for the effects of dopamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The striatum is a useful target for more detailed modelling as it has the highest neuron count in the basal ganglia, and comprises a complex microcircuit with several populations of interneurons. The parameters of the conversion function were calibrated according to firing rate data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We also developed a method for obtaining the minimal number of spiking neurons to reliably represent a single leaky integrator. The resulting firing rate output from the striatum was then fed into a rate-coded model of the rest of basal ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], parameterised to yield physiologically plausible ranges of firing rates.</p><p>The performance of the hybrid model was tested against its parent models and found to replicate the behaviour of the latter over the full range of possible inputs. Further, as a first demonstration of the ramifications of a phenomenon grounded in spikes, at the systems level, we used spike-timing dependent plasticity at cortico-striatal synapses to implement learning in basal ganglia.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>A.B. acknowledges the support of the University of Sheffield, Faculty of Engineering via its Prize Appointment Fund.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Izhikevich</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name><source>Dynamical systems in neuroscience</source><year>2007</year><publisher-name>Cambridge MA: MIT Press</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Humphries</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Lepora</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Gurney</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><article-title>Capturing dopaminergic modulation and bimodal membrane behaviour of striatal medium spiny neurons in accurate, reduced models</article-title><source>Front Comp Neuro</source><year>2009</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>26</fpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gurney</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Prescott</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Redgrave</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><article-title>A computational model of action selection in the basal ganglia.
