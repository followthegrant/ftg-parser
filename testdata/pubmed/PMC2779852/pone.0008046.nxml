This phenomenon, however, is much more pronounced at early stages of life when experiences cause long-lasting and sometimes irreversible effects on behaviors <xref rid="pone.0008046-Lorenz1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In rodents, it has been shown that early experiences such as social deprivation or impoverished rearing environments have life-long negative consequences on cognition <xref rid="pone.0008046-Oitzl1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008046-Iso1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In humans, it is known that speech development depends primarily on the presence of appropriate stimuli in the environment. The absence of speech models in children might negatively affect the acquisition of the language <xref rid="pone.0008046-Neal1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, whereas the exposure to a multilingual environment seems to improve learning performance <xref rid="pone.0008046-Bialystok1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>In Arthropods, changes in the environment during the early stages of the adult lifespan can also affect behaviors at later stages <xref rid="pone.0008046-Ichikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. For instance, in the ontogeny of nest-mate recognition in highly social insects, it has been shown that young worker ants are able to learn the odor of their social environment just after emergence, which strongly influences the recognition of colony members <xref rid="pone.0008046-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008046-Caubet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In the same way, in honeybees, olfactory cues paired with a reward shortly after emergence can be remembered when bees reach ages at which they initiate tasks outside the nest <xref rid="pone.0008046-Arenas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. On the contrary, chemosensory experiences such as odors exposed as volatiles in the rearing environment, can reduce the conditioned response when this odorant cue is paired with a reward in a later conditioning <xref rid="pone.0008046-Sandoz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008046-Fernndez1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, whether early experiences such as exposure to or learning of odorants during precocious periods improve retention of new learning events in insects is unknown.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that the behavior of an adult insect is more plastic at early ages than previously thought <xref rid="pone.0008046-Arenas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008046-Behrends1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and thus that the time during which early experiences can shape later behavior is greater a few days after emergence than at any other adult ages <xref rid="pone.0008046-Arenas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. When honeybees are reared under social deprivation within the laboratory, precocious learning of a particular odor associated with reward during a relatively short time window (when bees are 5&#x02013;8 days of adult age) results in a better olfactory retention at an older stage (when bees are 17 days old) than when the same experience occurs immediately after this period (when bees are 9&#x02013;12 days old). Interestingly, this difference is not observed when bees are reared within the colony <xref rid="pone.0008046-Arenas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, thus suggesting that a wide range of multi-modal stimulations may contribute to alter the levels of response between these age classes. Due to this non-linear effect of early olfactory experience, honeybees represent a good insect species to study whether precocious odor experiences improve the retention of a conditioned response (CR) that was acquired later in the adult life. Then, olfactory memories established after the first week of the adult worker (e.g. 9&#x02013;12 days of age) could be better retrieved after an appropriate input of early stimulation.</p><p>Besides, the fact that retention of olfactory memories is age-dependent and not time-dependent <xref rid="pone.0008046-Arenas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> becomes particular interesting in honeybees, since they exhibit an extraordinarily tuned division of labor based on age polyethism <xref rid="pone.0008046-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In these insects, individuals of the worker caste progress from inside- to outside-nest tasks, a process that is accompanied by anatomical and functional changes <xref rid="pone.0008046-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Newly emerged bees start cleaning the cells or taking care of the brood, while middle-aged bees handle and store food until they initiate foraging from the third week of the adult stage <xref rid="pone.0008046-Rsch1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008046-Seeley1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. To this end, the changing contexts at which the workers are exposed during adulthood make bees an excellent case to study the role of precocious sensory stimuli on later behavior.</p><p>To test this issue, we evaluated memories established in 9-12-day-old bees that were previously exposed to i) an odor-rewarded experience or ii) a non-rewarded experience either immediately after emergence (1&#x02013;4 days of age) or a few days after emergence (5&#x02013;8 days of age). Long-term memories were quantified during five consecutive testing events by presenting the conditioned stimulus (CS) alone (i.e. without reinforcement), a procedure that was expected to cause extinction <xref rid="pone.0008046-Garelick1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Site and Animals</title><p>The experiments were carried out in the 2007/2008 summer season in the experimental field of the School of Exact and Natural Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina (34&#x000b0; 32'S, 58&#x000b0; 26'W). Worker bees with a known age were obtained from sealed brood frames placed in an incubator at 36&#x000b0;C, 55&#x00025; relative humidity and darkness. Emerged workers were collected in groups of about 100 bees and confined in wooden boxes (10&#x000d7;10&#x000d7;10 cm) as previously described <xref rid="pone.0008046-Arenas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Single brood frames contained more than 2000 bees that emerged along a two-week period. Then, we obtained about 20 cages per comb with bees presenting low genetic variations to be used in each experimental series. As a result, each treatment (or age class) was replicated three-four times. In order to guarantee that the differences observed in behavior were not due to rearing environmental differences (other than the experimental treatments), all the groups were assayed within a two-week period. Caged bees were fed with 1.8M sugar solution, water and pollen <italic>ad libitum</italic> and kept at 30&#x000b0;C, 55&#x00025; relative humidity and darkness until 17 days of age, when they were captured for testing.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Testing and Conditioning of the Proboscis Extension Response</title><p>The olfactory learning behavior was analyzed using the Proboscis extension response (PER) paradigm <xref rid="pone.0008046-Takeda1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008046-Bitterman1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. To evaluate the PER, bees were harnessed after anesthesia at -4&#x000b0;C and kept in an incubator (30&#x000b0;C, 55&#x00025; relative humidity and darkness) for 3 hours. Then, only those bees that showed the unconditioned response (UR) after applying 1.8M sucrose solution onto the antennae were tested.</p><p>To assay the PER, a device that delivered a continuous airflow (50 ml/s) was used for the application of the odorant. Four microliters of pure odorant impregnated on 30&#x000d7;3 mm filter paper inside a syringe was delivered through a secondary air-stream (6.25 ml/s) to the head of the bee. A fan extracted the released odors to avoid contamination.</p><p>In most of the experiments, long-term memories were quantified during five testing events (CS presented without the US with an inter-trial interval of 10 min). When animals are exposed to a CS alone that has been previously paired with an US, the first stimulus presentation is commonly considered as a measure of memory retention. The successive presentation of the unrewarded CS causes a decrease in the CR level from the first to the last testing event and it is considered as a measure of extinction <xref rid="pone.0008046-Garelick1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

These time windows were chosen arbitrarily <xref rid="pone.0008046-Arenas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, they represent well-defined periods in which anatomical and functional changes in the honeybee interact with the development of the social activities in the hive. Immediately after emergence (1&#x02013;4 days of age), the worker bee scarcely performs tasks [at least during the 24&#x02013;48 hours as an adult <xref rid="pone.0008046-Rsch1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008046-Seeley1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>]; meanwhile its olfactory system is still in development. One week after emergence, worker bees start cleaning cells actively and taking care of the brood; at that time, the maturation of the olfactory system is finished. Middle-aged bees (i.e. 9&#x02013;12-days-old-bees) handle and store food inside the hive, whereas their olfactory circuitry is already completed <xref rid="pone.0008046-Masson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008046-Farris1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Within these periods, the scented food was always placed in the cages as the only source of sugar. The odors used were floral odors: Linalool (LIO) and Phenylacetaldehyde (PHE). The three treatments (1&#x02013;4, 5&#x02013;8 or 9&#x02013;12 days) were repeated using either LIO or PHE. Odor solutions were obtained by mixing 50 &#x000b5;l of pure odorant per liter of 1.8M sucrose solution. To reduce volatiles inside the cages, the scented food was offered through plastic tubes (10 ml volume) with a small opening (1 mm diameter) in its end, which allowed bees to drink only one at a time.</p><fig id="pone-0008046-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008046.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic schedule of the experimental series along the adult lifespan of the honeybee.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Caged bees were offered a scented sugar solution for four consecutive days (gray boxes), and their olfactory memories at 17 days of age were evaluated in the PER paradigm (black arrow).

Early associative learning either at the first four days of adulthood or at 5&#x02013;8 days of age clearly modified the level of retention of long-term memories acquired thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008046-g002">Fig. 2c and 2d</xref>) but might also influence extinction performance (not detected in our analysis). The 9-12-day-old conditioned bees that were previously stimulated with a scented sugar solution elicited higher retention when tested at 17 days of age as compared with those conditioned at the same age but without an additional olfactory experience. Moreover, the level of the initial conditioned response (CS-US memory retention) of the 9&#x02013;12 days groups with or without precocious experience also suggested differences in retrieval according to the identity of the conditioned odor (e.g. the difference between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008046-g002">Fig. 2a and 2c</xref> was 2&#x02013;12&#x00025;, while that between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008046-g002">Fig. 2b and 2d</xref> was about 36&#x02013;45&#x00025;).</p><p>On the other hand, volatile pre-exposure seems to also improve retention of long-term memories acquired at middle ages (9&#x02013;12 days), although its effect was weaker than the one found for the odor-rewarded experiences and cannot be extended to the both volatile compounds used (but only for PHE). In addition, it is fairly possible that such specific effect also depends on the interaction with the exposure timing. PER values appeared to be enhanced when PHE was exposed immediately before conditioning at 5&#x02013;8 days of age but not before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008046-g002">Fig. 2e</xref>). In line with these thoughts, no long-term effect was detected during differential conditioning in 17-day-old bees pre-exposed to a single odor in the environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008046-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). However, clear evidences about short-term and mid-term effects in young bees have been found both when individuals were exposed to volatiles in the PER setup <xref rid="pone.0008046-Chandra1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and inside the hive <xref rid="pone.0008046-Sandoz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Then, our results support the idea that although exposed odors offered to early and middle-aged bees are able to promote a learning-reduced effect (LI), it would be restricted to the short/middle-term.</p><p>Both the rewarded and non-rewarded olfactory experiences might facilitate learning and, in turn, retention of the same type of information at a later time. However, the different outcomes for each type of odor experience suggest different mechanisms by which memories established at middle adult ages are better retained. It is well known that newly emerged bees are able to acquire and store odor-rewarded information in an associative manner <xref rid="pone.0008046-Arenas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008046-Behrends1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, a process that induces changes in the olfactory circuits of the antennal lobe, affecting both the processing and consolidation of odor information <xref rid="pone.0008046-Faber1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008046-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This suggests that putative learning-induced changes in the brain of young adult bees might strengthen olfactory pathways that allow not only the retrieval of a specific piece of information acquired at very early ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008046-g002">Fig. 2a and 2b</xref>) but also that acquired later in life. In this sense, a recent study has shown that early odor learning during young adulthood, between 5 to 8 days after emergence, affects neural activity in the honeybee antennal lobe on a long-term scale <xref rid="pone.0008046-Arenas2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Conditioned odors evoke enhanced glomerular activity and modify spatiotemporal response patterns, which would underlie long-term olfactory memory for the early-experienced odor, but also for learning-induced modifications that persist in the brain, allowing bees to better retrieve the information they have acquired a few days before.</p><p>As no memories were detected when the bees of the different ages studied were exposed to volatile compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008046-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), the slightly enhanced response in 5&#x02013;8 &#x0002b; 9&#x02013;12-day-old bees may not account for learning-induced persistence changes in the brain. However, volatile exposure could still alter the normal development of the olfactory system, as has been shown for the exposure of queen mandibular pheromone, which at a young age can affect the workers' aversive learning abilities <xref rid="pone.0008046-Vergoz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Alternatively, PHE exposure at 5&#x02013;8 days of age might sensitize the bees in the short term, a process that would facilitate the acquisition and retention of new learning events. On the other hand, LIO rather than PHE used as conditioned stimulus at 9&#x02013;12 days of age might be responsible for our results. Asymmetries in retention of memories between LIO and PHE have been reported in honeybees <xref rid="pone.0008046-Sandoz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008046-Fernndez1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008046-Arenas3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> but also in moths <xref rid="pone.0008046-Daly2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and bumblebees <xref rid="pone.0008046-Laloi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and might be related to the biological meaning of these odorants.</p><p>Our results strongly suggest that the olfactory experiences acquired during the first week of life within an appetitive context (and probably also some pure odor acquired in the environment) are critical for the development of the long-term memory at least in the adult bees conditioned immediately after this stage. Since the functional properties of the olfactory system have been shown to be strongly influenced by changes in the environmental conditions from 3 days before to 4&#x02013;8 days after emergence <xref rid="pone.0008046-Masson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, early odor experiences might be important for the correct maturation of the olfactory pathways. Hence, it seems plausible that young worker bees need to be subjected to a constellation of chemosensory stimuli, like odors in the food or in the rearing environment, to achieve proper learning and retention abilities at older ages <xref rid="pone.0008046-Masson1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008046-Winnington1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008046-Maleszka1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Within the hive, bees are constantly exposed to diverse scents. As foragers bring different types of scented nectar back to the nest, young workers can learn food odors through mouth-to-mouth trophallaxis <xref rid="pone.0008046-Farina1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008046-Gil1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> while food is shared among hive mates. On the other hand, one-week-old bees performing tasks such as nursing or food processing handle food very often and thus have the opportunity to associatively learn different floral odors directly from the honey cells <xref rid="pone.0008046-Free1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Learning processes along the in-hive period might prepare workers for later tasks, including those performed outside the hive.</p><p>It also seems that the odors experienced by one-week-old bees will be later prioritized when these bees become foragers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008046-g002">Fig. 2a and 2b</xref>). Indeed, these experiences might bias food preferences in the field <xref rid="pone.0008046-Arenas3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In the complex scenery of olfactory stimuli that exists within the hive, the prevailing rewarded odors that change frequently as a result of switching blooms could form memories accessible to retrieval later in life. Then, changes in the floral availability would be better addressed and resumed when bees with different early-induced olfactory preferences coexist within the colony. This would enhance the chances of a bee hive to respond efficiently to a changing floral offer.</p><p>Several authors argue that a rearing environment plenty of stimuli must be the natural situation in animal development, whereas deprivation of stimuli is often an artificial situation leading to behavioral abnormalities <xref rid="pone.0008046-Sahakian1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008046-Lodge1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. We observed that early olfactory rewarded experiences prevented deficits in memories established at middle-age when the failure of a proper rearing environment might delay the maturation of the olfactory system. Then, in the honeybee, stimulus deprivation represents a non-natural situation that unveils that the retention of olfactory memories is age-dependent.</p><p>In summary, odor-rewarded experiences occurring within the first week of the adult lifespan bias odor-mediated responses to the previously experienced odorants at older ages, and enhance memorizing new learning events acquired later in life. These findings are not strictly reward specific, since a similar trend, although weaker, was also elicited by the exposure to certain odors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008046.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Discrimination Index after early odor exposure.
