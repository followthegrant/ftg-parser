To tackle those problems, a novel and green-based antimicrobial hydrogel dressing was synthesized in this work via modifying sugarcane bagasse cellulose with guanidine-based polymer, followed by crosslinking antimicrobial-modified cellulose with unmodified one at various ratios. The resulting hydrogels were comprehensively characterized with swelling measurements, compression test, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that the dressing possessed the degree of swelling up to 2000% and the compress strength as high as 31.39 Kpa, at 8:2 ratio of pristine cellulose to modified cellulose. The antibacterial activities of the dressing against <italic>E. coli</italic> were assessed using both shaking flask and ring diffusion methods. The results demonstrated that the dressings were highly effective in deactivating bacterium without leaching effect. Moreover, these hydrogels are biocompatible with live cell viability responses of (NIH3T3) cells above 76% and are very promising as wound dressing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cellulose</kwd><kwd>guanidine-based polymer</kwd><kwd>hydrogel dressing</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-polymers-11-01846"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>As the natural barrier on the surface of human body, skin plays a vital role in participating in metabolic processes, in regulating body temperature, and in protecting various tissues and organs in the body from being attacked by physical, mechanical, chemical actions, and pathogenic microorganisms [<xref rid="B1-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Once the skin is injured or damaged by the burn or other factors such as chronic wounds diseases and trauma, the umbrella of our body disappears. Consequently, the physiological functions of the internal organs are deteriorated, and the organs themselves are prone to microbial infection. The multidrug-resistant bacterial infections could further aggravate the wound, leading to serious problems in the clinic [<xref rid="B3-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Traditional dressing, such as fine belt, cotton, and gauze are the most widely used types of dressing in clinical practice at present. The main function is to keep the wound dry and prevent harmful bacteria from entering the wound to cause infection by absorbing and evaporating the wound secretion. However, the adhesion of such a dressing to the wound is often too strong, thus causing the secondary injury when dressing is removed or changed. Moreover, its ability of absorbing seepage is limited, so that the protective function of barrier is often lost after being soaked, which causes exogenous infection. Therefore, the innovative wound dressing with improved performance is urgently needed. It is well known that the medical dressing not only protects the wound, but also benefits the recovery of dermal and epidermal tissues for healing. Hence, the ideal dressing should possess the following characteristics: absorbable wound exudate, maintaining the temperature and humidity of the wound surface, good permeability, high antibacterial, anti-inflammatory activities, etc. [<xref rid="B4-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Among various potential materials suiting the requirements of wound dressing, hydrogel is the one close to an ideal dressing. As a hydrophilic macromolecular compound, hydrogel can hold a large amount of water without dissolution and provide a moist environment for the wound. Crosslinked by covalent bonds, ionic bonds, or hydrogen bonds, hydrogel is rendered a porous and three-dimensional network structure, which enhances its capability holding water significantly [<xref rid="B6-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Its porous structure can also provide transport channels for low molecular weight solutes, nutrients, and cell waste, which are critical for cell proliferation [<xref rid="B8-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The ideal cell carrier material should be able to simulate the natural environment around cartilage tissue matrix, possess certain compressive strength, and have good compatibility with biological tissue. Therefore, the research related to biomedical applications, such as drug carriers for controlled release, tissue scaffolds, and wound dressing has received enormous attention recently [<xref rid="B12-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Hydrogels that are based on natural polymers have many characteristics of extracellular matrix, which can direct cell migration, growth, and tissue during tissue regeneration [<xref rid="B9-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B15-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Natural polymers include various polysaccharides, proteoglycans and proteins; and typical examples are alginates, chitosan, cellulose, lignin, heparin, chondroitin collagen, gelatin, fibrin, keratin etc. [<xref rid="B17-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Those materials have been broadly used in wound treatment because of their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and similarity to macromolecules that are usually recognized by the human body [<xref rid="B16-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B19-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As one of the natural biocompatible polysaccharides, cellulose is a sustainable, nontoxic and most abundant natural polymer with good biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, relatively high thermo-stability, high sorption capacity, and cost-effectiveness [<xref rid="B22-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These properties make cellulose an excellent natural source for the production of hydrogels and composites for various biomedical applications, including wound dressing, drug delivery, and tissue engineering [<xref rid="B24-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Although the hydrogels synthesized from cellulose have many advantages, hydrogels themselves lack antibacterial activity. The ability of functional dressings to resist the infection of harmful microorganisms is particularly important. However, the deactivation caused by most existing antibiotics is based on their impact on the metabolism of bacteria, which already raised concerns related to drug resistance [<xref rid="B27-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Killing bacteria based on physical interactions, which would not cause bacterial drug resistance, is the approach to tackle the concerns. It has been proved that the antimicrobial agents with positively charged groups such as quaternary ammonium, or phosphonium, quaternary biguanidine antibiotics, deactivate bacteria via physical interaction [<xref rid="B28-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, when the antibacterial agent is simply mixed or impregnated into the dressing, the leaching-out of antimicrobial agent can be harmful or can lower the effectiveness. </p><p>To overcome the aforementioned problems, cellulose is chemically modified by incorporating functional groups, to render cellulose antibacterial. The graft copolymerization method has been often adopted in modifying cellulose and investigated extensively in the past decades [<xref rid="B23-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B31-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As a kind of cationic polyelectrolytes, guanidine-based polymer can adsorb on the negative charged surface of bacterial cells by electrostatic interaction and exchange ions with K<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the cell membrane, which in turn changes the fluidity and permeability of the cell membrane, thus destroying the cell membrane and deactivating bacteria. Guanidine salt oligomer is water-soluble and has high efficiency and broad-spectrum inhibition, high killing ability of microorganism, and low mammalian toxicity. However, the research and application of guanidine salt oligomer or polymer in dressing field has been seldom reported [<xref rid="B32-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>In this work, we aimed at synthetizing antimicrobial hydrogel by grafting guanidine-based polymers onto cellulose fibers via in situ-grafting, using epichlorohydrin as a coupling agent. The covalent bonding induced by crosslinking eliminates the problems associated with leaching and migration of antimicrobial polymer, which is often encountered in the systems by simply adding the antibacterial agent to the dressing via blending or impregnating. The results demonstrated that the dressing consisting of antimicrobial-modified cellulose hydrogel possesses high swelling, excellent antibacterial activity, and is promising for various medical treatments such as wound healing and the repair of damaged tissue.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-polymers-11-01846"><title>2.

Synthesis of Cellulose Grafted with Polyhexamethylene Guanidine Hydrochloride</title><p>A method similar to the procedures reported previously was used [<xref rid="B32-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Initially, equal molar amounts of hexanediamine (24.0 g) and guanidine hydrochloride (29.0 g) were mixed in a vacuumed three-necked flask under mechanical stirring (300 rpm) at 100 &#x000b0;C for 1 h, and then further reacted at 170 &#x000b0;C for 3 h. Ammonia, the byproduct of the reaction, was neutralized by dilute HCl solution. Afterwards, the viscous liquid was placed in a vacuum oven at room temperature to further remove residual ammonia. Finally, a solidified white polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (PHGH) was obtained. Antimicrobial modified cellulose was prepared by grafting the PHGH synthesized above bleached sugarcane bagasse pulp in the presence of epichlorohydrin as a coupling agent. Firstly, the epoxidation of cellulose was conducted according to our previous work [<xref rid="B33-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Specifically, the sugarcane bagasse pulp was pretreated with NaClO<sub>2</sub> and KOH to remove the lignin and hemicellulose from bagasse cellulose to obtain the sugarcane bagasse cellulose (SBC). 4 g of SBC was dispersed in 160 mL of diluted NaOH (2.5 wt %) solutions, using a high-speed homogenizer at 15,000 rpm. Next, epichlorohydrin (20 mL) and ethanol (40 mL) were dropwise added for epoxidation. Under mechanical stirring (400 rpm) at 60 &#x000b0;C, the reaction was maintained for 3 h. The product was washed and filtrate until pH = 7. The epoxidized cellulose (4.0 g) and deionized H<sub>2</sub>O (80 g) were mixed in a three-necked flask, and PHGH (2 g) was added to the epoxidized cellulose suspension above. The reaction lasted for 4 h at 70 &#x000b0;C and the resulting product was denoted as P-SBC. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-polymers-11-01846"><title>2.3.

P-SBC was dissolved under the same conditions and mixed with SBC solution at different mass ratios. The hydrogel without antimicrobial modified-cellulose was denoted as S-CH, which is 10:0 dressing. After dissolution, ECH (as a crosslinker) was added into mixtures at 25 &#x000b0;C for 2 h to produce a homogeneous solution, which was then kept at 60 &#x000b0;C for 12 h to obtain hydrogels. Depending on the wt ratio of P-SBC to SBC, the hydrogel dressings were denoted as P-CH, 8:2 dressing or 6:4 dressing.

Antimicrobial Modification of Cellulose with PHGH</title><p>In this work, guanidine prepolymer was firstly synthesized by condensation polymerization [<xref rid="B32-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Then, the prepolymer was grafted onto the epoxidized cellulose in the presence of ECH to produce antimicrobial-modified cellulose. The hydroxyl groups on cellulose main chains become oxygen anions under alkaline condition, which act as the nucleophilic reagent to react with epoxy group of epichlorohydrin. Specifically, the nucleophilic reagent firstly attacks C&#x02013;O&#x02013;C bond that is a position with a lower void steric resistance and a lower degree of substitution on the &#x02013;CH<sub>2</sub>. The reaction follows the SN2 mechanism, owing to the epoxy group with high activity. Afterwards, there are two ways for crosslinking. The first one referring the guanidine-based polymer is due to the interaction between C=N and the imino groups. The &#x003c0; electron of C=N and the adjoining lone pair electron of imino groups form the electron hyper conjugation cloud and transform in the direction of leaving the lone nitrogen atom, making the hydrogen atom of nitrogen atom become active. The second one is attributed to the reaction of the imino groups far from the C=N in alkaline medium, which are easy to react with epoxy groups in the P-SBC. The schematic of the reaction is depicted in <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="polymers-11-01846-sch001">Scheme 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot2-polymers-11-01846"><title>3.1.2. Chemical Interactions of Functional Groups in Hydrogel</title><p>The crosslinking between SBC and P-SBC was further conducted using ECH as a crosslinking agent to manipulate the performance of the hydrogel as dressing in terms of antimicrobial activity and compression strength, etc. Because of the relatively low solubility of P-SBC in the solvent, the degree of crosslinking was not sufficiently high to form a stable hydrogel when P-SBC was used alone. The use of pure SBC as support is essential in the current work for forming the composite hydrogel via co-crosslinking.

With the continuation of crosslinking, the excess crosslinking agent was eventually converted to glycerol. Due to the limited solubility of the modified cellulose in sodium hydroxide and urea, less hydroxyl groups are exposed for the reaction, so that the degree of crosslinking is relatively low.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot1dot3-polymers-11-01846"><title>3.1.3.

The peaks at 3390 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the spectra of SBC are ascribed to the O&#x02013;H stretching vibrations and the peak at 2899 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is the stretching vibration of aliphatic C&#x02013;H.

All the hydrogel samples exhibited three-dimensional network structures, whereas sample S-CH appeared to be highly porous with 3D structures. The pore size of pure hydrogel is relatively uniform, and the pore diameter ranges between 10&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;m. With the addition of P-SBC, the poor solubility of P-SBC in solvent lowered the degree of the polymer crosslinking, leading to uneven the pore channels.</p><p>The SEM images for S-CH and P-CH are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-01846-f002">Figure 2</xref>e,f, respectively. As can been seen, both hydrogels showed interconnected porous structure, which is crucial for tissue regeneration, and considered to be the basic requirement for cell anchoring, proliferation, and new tissue growth on the surface of hydrogels. In addition, the large interconnected pores of these hydrogels are expected to increase water absorption and promote the diffusion of nutrients, biomolecules, and cellular waste products.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-polymers-11-01846"><title>3.2. Swelling Properties</title><p>The SD (approximately 2000%) of S-CH was reached at equilibrium after the immersion of the hydrogel in phosphate saline buffer (PBS) at pH 7.4 and 37 &#x000b0;C for 24 h (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-01846-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Similarly, the SD of P-CH also reached approximately 2000% after 24 h. At the beginning, the water absorption of pure hydrogel with a high degree of crosslinking (i.e., 10:0 S-CH) was lower than that of 8:2 and 6:4 P-CH. Gradually, more water molecules enter the hydrogel through the pore channels, allowing the high absorption capacity towards water. Finally, the swelling degree becomes approximately the same. The interaction of hydrogen bonds between molecules further strengthens the mechanical properties of hydrogel, but meanwhile lowers the swelling rate. When the hydroxyl groups on cellulose chains are connected with guanidine salt, the N<bold><sup>&#x02026;</sup></bold>H&#x02013;O hydrogen bonding between the P-SBC and SBC is created, owing to the presence of primary and secondary amino groups in P-SBC. Therefore, the antimicrobial hydrogels possess high water absorption capacity, applicable as wound dressing, in wet and warm environment conducive to skin wound repair [<xref rid="B11-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B33-polymers-11-01846" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-polymers-11-01846"><title>3.3.

With increasing the content of PHGH to 1.5 wt %, the excellent antimicrobial activity was achieved (the rate &#x0003e; 99.99%). Compared with the P-SBC, the P-CH containing 1.0 wt % PHGH also demonstrated an enhanced antimicrobial activity and the rate reached 97.6%, Similarly, when the P-CH content of PHGH was 1.5 wt %, the antibacterial rate reached almost 100%. The antibacterial ingredients in hydrogels are critical for preventing the dressing from being attacked by bacteria. Such a high antimicrobial activity is attributed to the PHGH grafted onto the fiber. The PHGH is a cationic polyelectrolyte (mainly due to C=N<sup>+</sup> group), can readily adsorb on the negative-charge surface of bacterial cells by electrostatic interaction. The antimicrobial mechanism is governed by the physical action after the adsorption without raising drug resistant issues. The PHGH can exchange its ions with the potassium and magnesium in the cell membrane, thus alternating the fluidity and permeability of the cell membrane. The surface structure of the bacterial cell membrane is degenerated and destroyed. The membrane damage caused the leakage of low molecular weight cytoplasmic components and led to the collapse of the cells, thus deactivating the bacteria eventually.</p><p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-11-01846-f005">Figure 5</xref> presents the antimicrobial performance using the ring diffusion test. For sample P-CH (PHGH at 1.5%), there were no obvious bacteriostatic rings around the samples, whereas the results from shaking flask method has proved that the antibacterial efficiency of the same sample above 99.99%. No antimicrobial rings observed confirm the non-leaching characteristic of the antimicrobial hydrogel, which potentially eliminates the side effect of antimicrobial components in wound dressing and ensures the long-term effectiveness of bacterial barrier of the dressing. However, the hydrogel itself can act as a drug carrier, enabling the accommodation of drugs for healing purpose via controlled release. Meanwhile, the antimicrobial groups in the hydrogel prevent the dressing from being contaminated by bacteria surrounded.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-polymers-11-01846"><title>3.5.

Only a very small number of cells became irregular in shape and collapsed, and the cell fragments were slightly increased compared with the reference cell culture, which was consistent with the results of cell viability obtained from MTT assay.

Conclusions</title><p>Novel biocompatible hydrogels as wound dressing were successfully prepared based on PHGH-modified cellulose using epichlorohydrin as a crosslinking agent. The resulting hydrogels with degree of swelling up to 2000% exhibited durable mechanical strength and high antimicrobial activity against <italic>E. coli</italic>. In the presence of 1.5% (wt) grafted PHGH in hydrogel, the growth inhibition towards <italic>E.coli</italic> reached over 99.99%. Moreover, the antimicrobial polymer was covalently bonded with cellulose backbones, which eliminated the harmful impact on the environment because of the non-leaching effects. This also ensures the durability of the antimicrobial effect. These three-dimensional hydrogels are biocompatible, leading to over 76% of the live cell viability responses of cells. Overall, the P-CH dressing based on bagasse cellulose hydrogel was well designed with the properties that are tunable through chemical modification and crosslinking. They are envisioned as promising scaffolds for use in chronic wound dressings and skin tissue repair applications.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Formal analysis, X.L.; Methodology, P.C.; Supervision, Y.P.; Writing&#x02014;original draft, X.Z.; Writing&#x02014;review &#x00026; editing, Y.P.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (21466005, 21306027); the Dean Project of Guangxi Key Laboratory of Petrochemical Resource Processing and Process Intensification Technology (2018k001). </p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-polymers-11-01846"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boer</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Duchnik</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Maleszka</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Marchlewicz</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Structural and biophysical characteristics of human skin in maintaining proper epidermal barrier function</article-title><source>Adv.
