Despite these important functions, the regulatory mechanism underlying Chtop expression remains undetermined. Using Chtop-expressing human cell lines, we demonstrate that Chtop expression is controlled <italic>via</italic> an autoregulatory negative feedback loop whereby Chtop binds its own mRNA to retain intron 2 during splicing; a premature termination codon present at the 5&#x02032; end of intron 2 leads to nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA. We also show that Chtop interacts with exon 2 of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA <italic>via</italic> its arginine-glycine-rich (RG) domain, and with intron 2 <italic>via</italic> its N-terminal (N1) domain; both are required for retention of intron 2. In addition, we show that hnRNP H accelerates intron 2 splicing of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA in a manner dependent on Chtop expression level, suggesting that Chtop and hnRNP H regulate intron 2 retention of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA antagonistically. Thus, the present study provides a novel molecular mechanism by which mRNA and protein levels are constitutively regulated by intron retention.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>16 November 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chtop, the chromatin target of protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 1, localizes mainly in nuclear speckles and tightly associates with facultative heterochromatin in vertebrate interphase cells (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). As indicated by its alternative names SRAG (small protein rich in arginine and glycine (RG)) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and FOP (Friend of PRMT1), Chtop has an RG-rich domain, which is methylated by PRMT1 (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Chtop is expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types and is highly conserved in all vertebrates, although no ortholog has been identified in yeast, worm or fly.</p><p>Chtop is involved in activation of estrogen&#x02013;receptor target genes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and in the downregulation of fetal &#x003b3;-globin during the developmental transition from fetal to adult hemoglobin (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Chtop is therefore a potential therapeutic target for &#x003b2;-thalassemia and sickle cell disease via its ability to regulate &#x003b3;-globin gene expression (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Chtop is also involved in mRNA export as a component of the TREX complex (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); it drives remodeling of this complex during mRNP (mRNA-ribonucleoprotein complex) formation for mRNA export through its ability to bind the pre-mRNA splicing factor Uap56, which activates both its ATPase and RNA helicase activities. Methylation of an arginine residue in Chtop is required for this process (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition, Chtop is recruited to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-containing DNA sequences, which are common in glioblastoma cells and required for tumorigenicity (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Chtop also promotes PRMT1-mediated methylation of arginine 3 of histone H4, resulting in activation of many cancer-related genes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For these reasons, Chtop is a potential therapeutic target for certain cancers including glioblastoma.</p><p>Finally, Chtop is a component of the nuclear SMN (survival of motor neuron protein) complex that contains U5 and U6 but lacks U1 and U2 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Chtop is required for association of the SMN complex with heterogeneous nuclear RNPs (hnRNPs), histones and various RNA-binding proteins (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Despite accumulating evidence that Chtop is involved in various aspects of gene expression, the underlying mechanism by which the expression level of Chtop itself is regulated remains undetermined. Here, we show that Chtop, by binding to exon 2 and intron 2 of its own mRNA, controls its protein level by negatively affecting the splicing of its own pre-mRNA. This, in turn, facilitates the formation of an intron 2 (Int2)-retained <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA that is subsequently degraded via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>RNA Isolation and RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA from the cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

We subjected the DNAs to direct sequencing and confirmed that the 2000-bp DNA fragment had the intron-less sequence Ex1-Ex6 (Supplementary Figure S2A) and that the 3500-bp DNA fragment contained Int2 (Supplementary Figure S2B); we therefore denoted this DNA as Ex1-(Int2)-Ex6.

Using two other primer sets to amplify regions covering Ex1-Ex4 and Ex4-Ex6, we confirmed that FLAG-Chtop induction increased the PSI values of the 2000-bp Ex1-(Int2)-Ex4 band, and reduced the PSI values of the 600-bp (Ex1-Ex4) and 1000-bp (Ex4-Ex6) bands (Supplementary Figure S2C). The increase of Ex1-(Int2)-Ex4 was detected in both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear fractions prepared by cell fractionation of the FLAG-Chtop induced cells (Supplementary Figure S2D), indicating that Int2-retained <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA is delivered to the cytoplasm. A methyltransferase inhibitor (5&#x02032;-methylthioadenosine, MTA) did not show any effect on Int2-retention of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Since methylation of an arginine residue in Chtop is required for its role in the TREX complex, this suggests that the cytoplasmic localization of Int2-retained <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA is not linked to the TREX complex (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>To investigate Int2 retention further, we constructed a minigene containing Ex1-(Int2)-Ex4 positioned upstream of the GFP-coding DNA (wild-type Ex1-(Int2)-Ex4-GFP mini gene) (Supplementary Figure S2E).

In this analysis, the proportion of Ex1-(Int2)-Ex4-GFP increased with increasing FLAG-Chtop level compared with cells lacking FLAG-Chtop expression (Supplementary Figure S2F). In addition, the Chtop knockdown reduced the PSI value of Int2-retained transcript compared with that measured for cells transfected with scrambled/nonspecific RNA (scRNA) (Supplementary Figures S2G and S2H). We also used the E1A minigene (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) to distinguish between splicing inhibition and regulated alternative splicing, and showed that the increase of Chtop expression did not affect splicing of this minigene (Supplementary Figure S2I), suggesting that Chtop causes Int2 retention of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA as regulated alternative splicing.

We prepared additional Dox-inducible T-REx 293 cell lines expressing various deletion mutants of Chtop (&#x00394;C1, &#x00394;RG, &#x00394;N1 or NLS&#x00394;N1), each containing an N-terminal FLAG tag (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). When the four mutants were individually expressed in T-REx 293 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), only &#x00394;C1 reduced the proportion of endogenous <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA (Supplementary Figure S4A).

All of the minigenes tested displayed increased Int2 retention upon increased expression of Chtop (Supplementary Figure S5B). Next, we constructed minigenes in which two regions of Ex1-(Int2)-Ex4-GFP were altered by combination of deletion and replacement; i.e. &#x00394;Ex1-2/&#x00394;Int2-1 had a replacement of Ex1 and Ex2 by Ex2 of the <italic>INS2</italic> gene and a deletion of Int2-1, &#x00394;Ex1-2 had replacement of Ex1 and Ex2 by Ex2 of the <italic>INS2</italic> gene, &#x00394;Ex1/&#x00394;Int2-1 had deletions of Ex1 and Int2-1, and &#x00394;Ex2/&#x00394;Int2-1 had a replacement of Ex2 by Ex2 of the <italic>INS2</italic> gene and a deletion of Int2-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

Since Ex2 has a relatively small length of 81 nucleotides, we synthesized a biotin labeled-RNA containing the entire region of Ex2 (BT-Ex2), and examined its binding to each of the Chtop domain mutants (&#x00394;C1, &#x00394;RG or NLS-&#x00394;N1) by RNA&#x02013;protein binding assay. This assay indicated that the RG domain is responsible for the binding to Ex2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Int2-1 has a length of 441 nucleotides, so we divided Int2-1 into two regions to synthesize their corresponding RNAs, taking the highly conserved regions of the Int2 sequence in <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA among 100 vertebrates into account (UCSC Genome browser; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>) (Supplementary Figure S6B and S6C).

We confirmed the direct binding between N1 and BT-Int2-1-2-2 by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using recombinant N1 domain fused to trigger factor (TF) (Supplementary Figures S6F and S6G). TF-N1 caused a shift of BT-Int2-1-2-2 but not Bt-Int2-1-2-1, whereas TF alone (control) did not cause any shift (Supplementary Figure S6H). These data indicated that Chtop, via domain N1, binds the Int2-1-2-2 region of its mRNA.</p><p>To predict the secondary structure of the Int2-1-2-2 region, we used the RNAfold webserver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi">http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi</ext-link>) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). This analysis predicted that Int2-1-2-2 could form two stable stem-loops (Supplementary Figure S6I). Because the sequence of region Int2-1-2-2 is highly conserved among vertebrates, we assumed that these two predicted stem-loops are important for binding to Chtop and for Chtop-mediated Int2 retention. To further narrow the region responsible for Int2 retention, we constructed two additional Int2-containing minigenes, &#x00394;Int2-1-2-2a and &#x00394;Int2-1-2-2b, each lacking one of the predicted stem-loops of region Int2-1-2-2 (Supplementary Figure S6J). Mutant &#x00394;Int2-1-2-2a decreased the ratio of Int2-retained mRNA to unretained mRNA by &#x0223c;40% compared with that of Ex1-(Int2)-Ex4-GFP, and &#x00394;Int2-1-2-2b reduced the ratio by &#x0223c;77% (Supplementary Figure S6K). This result indicated that each of the predicted stem-loops contributes to Int2 retention with a more important role for Int2-1-2-2a. In agreement with this notion, our RNA&#x02013;protein binding assays also showed that both BT-Int2-1-2-2a and BT-Int2-1-2-2b bound to FLAG-Chtop, but BT-Int2-1-2-2b bound very weakly (Supplementary Figure S6L). To disrupt the two predicted stem-loop structures of region Int2-1-2-2, we synthesized a mutant BT&#x02013;RNA having a sequence corresponding to region Int2-1-2-2 but containing a G-to-C switch at nine positions in the two repeat sequences in Int2-1-2-2 (BT-Int2-1-2-2pSL) (Supplementary Figure S6I). BT-Int2-1-2-2pSL did not bind significantly to recombinant TF-N1 as revealed by EMSA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). We then constructed an Ex1-(Int2)-Ex4-GFP minigene containing a G-to-C switch at nine positions in region Int2-1-2-2 (Int2pSL) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and Supplementary Figure S6I). Int2pSL caused only marginal Int2 retention (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). To assess the importance of these mutations further, we constructed a &#x00394;Ex1-2/Int2pSL minigene in which the Ex1 and Ex2 of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA were replaced by Ex2 of <italic>INS2</italic> mRNA and Int2-1-2-2 regions of <italic>Chtop</italic>&#x000a0;mRNA by Int2pSL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), and showed that this construct did not cause Int2 retention (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the two predicted stem-loops containing conserved repeat sequences in region Int2-1-2-2 of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA are responsible for Chtop-mediated Int2 retention and suggest strongly that the two regions Ex2 and In2-1-2-2 in <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA are responsible for Int2 retention via binding to the RG and N1 domain of Chtop, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-7"><title>hnRNP H negatively regulates Int2 retention</title><p>Previous proteomic analysis identified a number of nuclear proteins that associate with Chtop, including proteins involved in mRNA splicing and mRNA export such as SRSF6, hnRNP F and hnRNP H (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).

Association of endogenous hnRNP H with the Int2-retained <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA increased in concert with increased FLAG-Chtop expression compared with cells lacking FLAG-Chtop expression (Supplementary Figure S7C). We did not detect association between hnRNP H and Int2-spliced <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA (Ex1-Ex4 in Supplementary Figure S7C) even with FLAG-Chtop expression. These data suggest that hnRNP H increased its interaction with the Int2 region of Int2-retained <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA in conjunction with increased Chtop expression, or that increased Chtop interaction with its mRNA results in the detection of hnRNP H interaction with the mRNA. To further narrow the region responsible for the binding of hnRNP H, we examined RNA&#x02013;protein binding assay using the synthetic BT-RNAs and showed that hnRNP H bound Int2 in the regions corresponding mainly to Int2-1 and to a lesser extent to Int2-2. In contrast, hnRNP H did not have interactions with BT-RNAs corresponding to Int2-3 and exon 2 of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA (Supplementary Figure S7D).</p><p>We next examined interaction between hnRNP H and Chtop by pulldown analysis in combination with RNase treatment, revealing that FLAG-Chtop associated with hnRNP H independently of RNA (Supplementary Figure S7E). As a control, RNase activity was confirmed by the disappearance of U4 snRNA. The pulldown analysis was also carried out using the domain mutants &#x00394;C1, &#x00394;RG, &#x00394;N1 and NLS&#x00394;N1 revealing that only &#x00394;C1 associated with hnRNP H (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Because &#x00394;RG and NLS&#x00394;N1 localized to the nucleus (as did wild-type FLAG-Chtop and &#x00394;C1) but did not interact with hnRNP H (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>), these results suggested that the N1 and RG domains are responsible for Chtop binding to hnRNP H.</p><p>Finally, we examined the effect of overexpression of hnRNP H on Int2 retention, and found that the Chtop-induced Int2 retention was reduced by the overexpression of hnRNP H. Since overexpression of hnRNP H as such did not affect splicing and retention of Int2 of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>), we conclude that Chtop and hnRNP H have an antagonistic effect on Int2 retention of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we demonstrate that the cellular level of Chtop is autoregulated via Int2 retention of its own mRNA, which subsequently undergoes NMD. We also show that domains RG and N1 of Chtop interact with Ex2 and the putative stem loop structure in Int2, respectively, and that both interactions are required for Int2 retention of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In addition, we show that hnRNP H is involved in Int2 removal. Given that deficiency of hnRNP H increases Int2-retained <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>), and that Chtop-induced Int2 retention is reduced by overexpression of hnRNP H (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>), we suggest that Int2 retention of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA is balanced by antagonistic action of Chtop and hnRNP H. Since Chtop and hnRNP H act on Int2 retention and splicing independently of each other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), the proportion of Int2 retention is probably determined by the relative amount of Chtop to that of hnRNP H in the cell. In this case, we do not exclude the possibility that Chtop associates with hnRNP H without binding to regions in Ex2 and Int2-1-2-2; this association may also suppress the ability of hnRNP H to promote Int2 removal. Because Chtop bridges hnRNPs, including hnRNP H and the nuclear SMN complex, it is also possible that the hnRNP H&#x02013;Chtop interaction is mediated by the SMN complex (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It would therefore be interesting to determine whether Chtop anchors both hnRNP H and the SMN complex on Int2.</p><fig id="F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Proposed mechanism by which Chtop regulates Int2 Exclusion. Chtop binds to the stem-loop region in Int2 of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA via its N1 domain and Ex2 via its RG region, and inhibits the excision of Int2. Int2-retained <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA contains a stop codon at the 5&#x02032; side of Int2 and is degraded by NMD. hnRNP H binds Int2 of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA and N1-RG of Chtop protein, and promotes excision of Int2. Chtop and hnRNP H regulate Int2 splicing antagonistically.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkw831fig8"/></fig><p>A number of studies have reported negative feedback mechanisms in which protein levels are autoregulated by modulating alternative mRNA splicing followed by NMD (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), but the molecular mechanisms underlying such autoregulation have been elucidated for only a few proteins (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). One such case is PTB, for which a high concentration increases its binding to intron 10 of its mRNA; this increases exon 11 skipping, producing an mRNA that then undergoes NMD (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Another example is hnRNP L, which, at high concentration, increases its binding to intron 6 of its mRNA, thereby increasing exon 6a inclusion that also leads to NMD (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, these two examples of autoregulatory mechanisms do not involve intron retention.</p><p>Intron retention is generally thought to occur because of mis-splicing resulting in failed intron excision (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Because intron-retained mRNAs often contain premature a stop codon, they are expected to undergo NMD (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Recently, Wong <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) reported that intron retention coupled with NMD is a physiological mechanism of gene expression control in normal granulopoiesis, but the molecular mechanism by which intron retention occurs is largely unknown. The present study provides a novel autoregulation mechanism involving intron retention followed by NMD.</p><p>Finally, because upregulation of Chtop is required for tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), it would be interesting to investigate whether Int2 retention-coupled NMD of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA is downregulated in glioblastoma cells. In addition, an increase in &#x003b3;-globin level mitigates the severity of &#x003b2;-thalassemias (because &#x003b3;-globin can mediate the replacement of adult hemoglobin with fetal hemoglobin) and sickle cell disease (because &#x003b3;-globin can counteract polymerization of sickle hemoglobin) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Because Chtop is a critical modulator of &#x003b3;-globin gene expression (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), Int2 retention during splicing of <italic>Chtop</italic> mRNA may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of these two diseases.</p></sec>
