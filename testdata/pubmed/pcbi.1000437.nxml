When attributed to reward-predicting stimuli (cues), incentive salience triggers a pulse of &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; and an individual is pulled toward the cues and reward. A key computational question is how incentive salience is generated during a cue re-encounter, which combines both learning and the state of limbic brain mechanisms. Learning processes, such as temporal-difference models, provide one way for stimuli to acquire cached predictive values of rewards. However, empirical data show that subsequent incentive values are also modulated on the fly by dynamic fluctuation in physiological states, altering cached values in ways requiring additional motivation mechanisms. Dynamic modulation of incentive salience for a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS or cue) occurs during certain states, without necessarily requiring (re)learning about the cue. In some cases, dynamic modulation of cue value occurs during states that are quite novel, never having been experienced before, and even prior to experience of the associated unconditioned reward in the new state. Such cases can include novel drug-induced mesolimbic activation and addictive incentive-sensitization, as well as natural appetite states such as salt appetite. Dynamic enhancement specifically raises the incentive salience of an appropriate CS, without necessarily changing that of other CSs. Here we suggest a new computational model that modulates incentive salience by integrating changing physiological states with prior learning. We support the model with behavioral and neurobiological data from empirical tests that demonstrate dynamic elevations in cue-triggered motivation (involving natural salt appetite, and drug-induced intoxication and sensitization). Our data call for a dynamic model of incentive salience, such as presented here. Computational models can adequately capture fluctuations in cue-triggered &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; only by incorporating modulation of previously learned values by natural appetite and addiction-related states.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Reward cues are potent triggers of desires, ranging from normal appetites to compulsive addictions. Food cues may trigger a sudden desire to eat before lunch, and drug cues may trigger even a &#x02018;recovered addict&#x02019; to relapse again into drug taking. But learned cues are not constant in their motivating power. Food cues are more potent when you are hungry, and drug cues may become overwhelmingly potent to an addict who tries to take &#x02018;just one&#x02019; drink or hit, precipitating an escalating binge of further relapse. These changes in cue-triggered desire produced by a change in biological state present a challenge to many current computational models of motivation. Such modulation can even be unlearned (though the modulation interacts with cues acquired through learning), in that the modulation instantly follows a physiological or neurobiological change (hunger, drug hit, etc.), altering the cue's ability to trigger desire for a relevant reward. Here we demonstrate concrete examples of instant modulation and propose how to build computational models of cue-triggered &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; to better capture the dynamic interaction between learning and physiology that controls the incentive salience mechanism of motivation for rewards.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Incentive salience <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> is a mechanism to explain motivational values of specific learned stimuli (Pavlovian conditioned stimuli) and associated natural rewards (unconditioned stimuli) in humans and animals <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Toates1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The incentive salience framework postulates a fundamental dissociation in brain mechanisms between reward &#x02018;liking&#x02019; and reward &#x02018;wanting&#x02019;. &#x02018;Liking&#x02019; is the hedonic impact or pleasure associated with the receipt of an immediate reward while &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; is incentive salience itself: a motivational magnet quality that makes the conditioned or unconditioned stimulus a desirable and attractive goal <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge4" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Psychological incentive salience is actively attributed by brain systems to a sensory stimulus, transforming it from a mere sensory representation into a &#x02018;wanted&#x02019; and attractive incentive capable of grabbing attention and motivating approach, seeking and consumption behaviors. Although nonhedonic, unlike &#x02018;liking&#x02019;, which reflects the pleasure or hedonic impact of the stimulus, incentive salience (&#x02018;wanting&#x02019;) is still motivational.</p><p>The incentive salience of a cue is established by learning Pavlovian S-S associations between a cue (conditioned stimulus or CS) and its reward (unconditioned stimulus or UCS). However, the incentive salience framework also postulates a difference between learning and &#x02018;wanting&#x02019;: especially evident as post-learning dissociations between the previously learned values of a stimulus and its motivational value at a later moment <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge5" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Incentive salience can dynamically change, being generated afresh each time the stimulus is re-encountered and incorporating into the computation a second source of input besides previously-learned cached values. This second source of input is physiological state, which includes natural hunger or thirst appetite and satiety states, drug-induced states such as intoxication priming, withdrawal and permanent sensitization, and states of brain mesocorticolimbic systems (often involving dopamine) translate these physiological states into motivation. In this paper we focus on the dynamic nature of this interaction between learned and physiological inputs that combine to modulate motivation.</p><p>Importantly, physiological modulation of cue-triggered incentive salience can occur immediately when a state changes, without necessarily any need for additional learning. The most convincing example occurs when a never-before experienced physiological state, such as a specific appetite, modulates cue-triggered motivation appropriately for a previously learned Pavlovian cue <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge5" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Natural specific appetites, such as salt appetite, dynamically and appropriately modulate incentive salience or &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; triggered by their own reward cues. Conditioned stimuli associated with salt, food, or drink rewards <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Toates1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> are thus modulated in incentive salience value (in parallel with the alliesthesia modulation of the hedonic value of their UCS rewards, but perhaps even more strongly <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Cabanac1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>).</p><p>The underlying physiological mechanism of incentive salience is postulated to involve mesocorticolimbic brain systems that involve dopamine activation <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The relationship to brain dopamine states makes incentive salience vulnerable to enhancement by psychostimulant drugs that activate dopamine systems. Enduring neural sensitization of dopamine-related mesolimbic systems induced by repeated exposures to drugs is the basis for the incentive-sensitization theory of drug addiction <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Sensitization of dopamine-related systems by binging on drugs such as heroin and cocaine is thought to produce long-lasting hyper-excitability of the brain's mesocorticolimbic system and to result in compulsive &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; to take drugs and in cue-triggered relapse. Sensitized &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; may effectively trigger relapse even when addicts may not derive much pleasure from the drugs, nor expect to derive much pleasure, and even long after the addict is free of withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>One implication of the dependence of incentive salience on both previously-learned Pavlovian associations and the current physiological state is that the motivation values of learned cues may vary from what was previously learned. The incentive value of a cue will equal the learned value <italic>if and only if</italic> the physiological state during testing is similar to the state during learning. When physiological states shift, the motivational value may be transformed from the learned value, either up or down, even if the cue and reward have not yet been experienced in the new state. The new &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; value is revealed when the cue is re-encountered again. Thus, incentive salience maps onto <italic>decision utility</italic> triggered by a reward cue. This decision utility can be changed by shifts of physiological state without necessarily changing either the <italic>remembered utility</italic> of the reward previously associated with that cue, the <italic>predicted utility</italic> of expected future rewards, or the hedonic <italic>experienced utility</italic> of those rewards when eventually consumed <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge5" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Kahneman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The distinction between decision utility and remembered/predicted utility places a firewall between motivation and learning that protects the integrity of learned values. Cached values for Pavlovian associations do not need to be rewritten in order to explain changes in incentive salience. Further, cognitive predictions of future value need not be distorted by fluctuating appetite states.</p><p>At the same time, the firewall allows the incentive salience of the same Pavlovian cues to be more labile, and to change more in lockstep with relevant physiological shifts <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A consequence is that an individual can have a change in &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; without necessarily changing expectations of future liking, as well as without changing actual &#x02018;liking&#x02019; of the reward when it occurs. Thus, incentive salience may sometimes be magnified to the point that produces &#x02018;irrational wants&#x02019; where decision utility is strongly elevated over the concomitant predicted utility. This mismatch can have a dire outcome, such as when drug addicts who have unwittingly caused mesolimbic sensitization in their own brains may persist irrationally in cue-triggered pulses of &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; to take drugs, even when they recognize cognitively that the drug may not be very pleasant, not worth the costs, and they wish to abstain <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge5" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Such elevations in &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; can occur without necessarily any fluctuation in learned associations or in cognitive predictions of reward value.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Incentive salience and dopamine prediction error models of reward learning</title><p>Incentive salience is essentially a Pavlovian motivational response: it takes Pavlovian associations as its learned input. Potential differences between cached valence and motivation values for Pavlovian cues have been previously noted by computational modelers and learning theorists <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. For example, Dayan and Balleine noted that, &#x0201c;Pavlovian CRs are &#x02026; directly sensitive to the level of motivation of the subjects, such as whether or not they are hungry. This motivational or affective control argues against simple realizations of the critic in which there is one set of weights or parameters (whatever their neural realization) mapping from stimulus representations (i.e., units whose activities are determined by the stimuli shown to the subject) to the values&#x0201d; (p. 288, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>).</p><p>Here we aim to account for such motivation variations by identifying incentive salience computations that dynamically determine Pavlovian motivation value. These computations must integrate Pavlovian learned inputs with the status of the brain mesolimbic mechanisms that reflect current physiological states (hungers, drug intoxication, sensitization, etc.).</p><p>To see the difference between the vantage points of incentive salience compared to reward learning, it may be helpful to review how cached values are established in contemporary reinforcement learning models. For example, the temporal-difference (TD) method provides an explicit &#x0201c;model-free&#x0201d; formula for estimating expected reward. It is model-free in the sense that it does not involve an internal model or cognitive map of the world, but depends only on cached experiences and the accumulated state for estimating the value function. The estimate is based on summed values from reward prediction errors &#x02013; the discrepancy between the reward expected from a stimulus (technically, a state) and the reward actually received <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Rescorla1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Redish1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-ODoherty1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. One influential neurobiological view identifies the predictive error signal, which lies at the core of temporal difference learning, with the firing of dopaminergic neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Schultz3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Schultz4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> (though this notion is not without controversy regarding the causal role of dopamine systems in generating prediction errors and value estimates <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Redgrave1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>). The actor-critic architecture, along with the TD-based learning rule, carries great computational power. It provides, at least theoretically, a consistent and effective scheme to solve the so-called &#x0201c;dynamic programming&#x0201d; problem <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Puterman1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> concerning optimization for sequential decision-making under a stationary Markov environment, without the need of an elaborate model of the world (i.e., how states unfold successively and how one's actions affect such state-transition) <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Schultz2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Schultz4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Montague2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Kringelbach1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>The TD error model also has been applied to incentive salience <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-McClure1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. A first step was taken by McClure, Daw and Montague, who used the concept of prediction error-driven learning, and equated cue-triggered &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; with the cached Pavlovian learned value acquired by the TD method <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-McClure1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Their model postulated incentive salience to function as a cached, cumulative reward value, which, if a reward was suddenly revalued, could be changed only by further relearning about a new prediction error by re-encountering the UCS. They suggested that &#x0201c;the role of dopamine in learning to attribute such expectations to situations that are predictive of reward and in biasing action selection towards such situations as the formal counterpart to the ideas of Berridge and Robinson about the role of dopamine in attributing and using incentive salience.&#x0201d; p. 425, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-McClure1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. While a useful contribution that exploited the TD model's strengths to capture trial-by-trial &#x02018;reboosting&#x02019; of &#x02018;wanting&#x02019;, we believe it is only an initial step towards modeling incentive salience.</p><p>Despite the computational success of actor-critic architecture, several theorists have suggested, as noted above and consistent with our view here, that additional mechanisms must be added to explain emerging psychological and neurobiological data and to account for motivation because the simple form of actor-critic architecture produces a rigidly incremental cached value of prediction <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Niv3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. One solution to account for immediate state-based changes in behavior has been to posit that dopamine also modulates the &#x0201c;vigor&#x0201d; of all responses in a general fashion <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan3" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Niv3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Additionally, uncertainty or generalization decrements after a state change has been suggested to explain some reduction in behavioral responses, at least for changes that devalue a reward downwards <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Daw1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Another alternative solution is to sidestep the model-free cached limitations and add an entirely separate model-based (e.g., cortically-embedded) mechanism for reward prediction in the form of a model-based or tree-search system that explicitly represents the world as a cognitive &#x0201c;state space&#x0201d;. Such a cognitive model includes goal values and act-outcome (A-O) relationships, and which can adjust instrumental behavior more flexibly, at least once a new goal value is known by experience <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Niv1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Daw1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge6" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Still, cue-triggered &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; differs from all the above, and we believe may more accurately capture the chief motivation function of brain mesocorticolimbic systems. The re-computations of the incentive salience for a Pavlovian CS may in some cases be carried out in a highly dynamic, stimulus-specific and stimulus-bound fashion, as will be described below. This is possible because of Bindra-Toates rules of Pavlovian motivation that underlie incentive salience <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Toates1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Those rules are distinct from both cached TD values and model-based cognitive predictions.</p><p>Cached values and model-based predictions of reward both often assume that a reward will be about as good in the future as it was in the past <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-McClure1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Redish2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Robust computational theories exist for those cached model-free values and cognitive model-based systems, but not yet for Bindra-Toates computations of incentive salience. A similar sentiment was recently expressed by Dayan and Niv, &#x0201c;Unfortunately, the sophisticated behavioral and neural analyses of model-free and model-based instrumental values are not paralleled, as of yet, by an equivalently worked-out theory for the construction of Pavlovian values.&#x0201d; (p. 191) <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Our goal here is to take a small step towards a better computational theory for Pavlovian-guided generation of incentive salience. Specifically, we aim for a model able to compute cue-triggered &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; even for novel physiological modulations that occur before there is an opportunity for relearning the altered reward.

This is because merely changing polarity in a multiplicative Equation (3a) would invert the rank order when multiple reward stimuli in the same family were involved (e.g. 3 concentrations of salt). That would revalue the respective order of the series in ways that might be unrealistic. For example, reversing valence in a multiplicative model would cause the reward that was originally most highly liked and &#x02018;wanted&#x02019; of all to become the most highly disliked or repulsive after devaluation of all; an intermediately liked reward would become intermediately disliked, while a nearly neutral reward stimulus would remain nearly neutral after polarity reversal. Such re-ordering fails to describe what happens in empirical cases of valence reversal, where the originally most liked reward may often still remain the best of a bad lot, becoming the least disliked as a physiological manipulation changes the valence of the entire group.</p><p>By contrast, an additive model as expressed in Equation (3b), allows the &#x02018;best&#x02019; stimulus to remain best relative to the others, even if their absolute values may switch valence (i.e., all shift across zero). Specific candidates for polarity reversal include reversals in reward values from nasty to nice, such as described below where an intensely salty taste reward is re-encountered during a salt appetite, or from nice to nasty such as after taste-aversion devaluation <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Fudim1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge8" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Grill1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000437-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The modulatory factor <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> is assumed to be independently controlled by the geometric temporal discounting under <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>, though it is possible that such changes can be coupled.

This specificity includes specific natural appetites, such as salt, hunger, thirst, etc; as well as mesolimbic sensitization involved in drug addiction.

Still, under some conditions, incentive salience may spill over from one appetite state to modulate CSs for another appetite state.

The region spanning &#x02212;60&#x000b0; to 60&#x000b0; represents dominant neural firing to CS2, which occurs at moment of highest motivation excitement, and we denote it as the motivational or &#x0201c;incentive-coding&#x0201d; area.

Further, Eqn (3a) would also apply to changes in aversiveness from bad to worse (or vice versa) for fear, disgust or other negative evaluations that involve a negative version of motivation salience, such as changes in active fear or in psychotic paranoia produced by dopamine-blocking drugs or by psychological mood manipulations <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Faure1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Kapur1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000437-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, Eqn (3b) expresses the generic model as an additive version, which is intended to account for special cases where incentive value actually reverses valence between positive and negative poles. Those include reversal of incentive salience for intense salt from negatively &#x02018;unwanted&#x02019; to positively &#x02018;wanted&#x02019; during salt appetite, and would also include flips from &#x02018;wanted&#x02019; to &#x02018;unwanted&#x02019; such as when a sucrose taste is converted from good to bad by aversion conditioning (i.e., pairing as CS with nausea as UCS), or flips between desire and dread <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Reilly1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>.</p><sec id="s4b1"><title>Comparing incentive salience model to standard reinforcement learning models</title><p>How does our model (Eqns 3; 3a; 3b) contrast to a cached-value TD model or to a flexible tree-search model involving a cognitive state space&#x0003f; According to a standard TD reinforcement model, optimal policy is invariant (i.e., remains unchanged) if the entire vector of primary rewards in every state is subject to the same affine transform (r&#x02212;&#x0003e;ar&#x0002b;b, a&#x0003e;0) with fixed a,b. Cached values are relatively stable, and able to produce the same optimal behavior across a wide range of homeostatic/motivational states. But they are not able to dynamically modulate after a shift without further retraining.</p><p>The dynamic situations here, however, were very different and not amenable to a stable solution strategy, as the motivational revaluation occurred without the individual having had a chance to relearn. The cached value-function of each state (CSs) would not have been adjusted until after the next encounter with primary reward (UCS); the UCS itself would be immediately modulated by the physiological shift but would still need to be presented to effect a re-evaluation of CS.</p><p>More flexible are tree-search models, sometimes called model-based systems because they model or map the world in a way that explicitly represents goal values and relationships in a nested tree or similar recursive structure <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Niv1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Daw1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Redish2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Balsam1" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>.

Still, some model-based formulations and psychological counterparts are constrained by whether the tree contains sufficient information to compute a new value in a state, which for some systems may depend on whether the goal has ever been tasted before while in a similar state <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. For example, as Dickinson and Balleine put it in describing the behavior of rats when guided by cognitive act-outcome relations involving hedonically positive memories of a sucrose goal they used to work for, but which had subsequently been devalued by taste-aversion conditioning: &#x0201c;we gave (some of) our rats the opportunity to taste the sugar after they had acquired a latent aversion to it. This re-tasting had a profound effect when we subsequently tested their desire to search for the sugar water by lever pressing. In the absence of the re-tasting, they behaved as though they were ignorant of their aversion&#x02026;, whereas those that had re-tasted the sugar water showed little propensity to seek it out again (the devalued sugar water)&#x0201d; (p. 103) <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. That is, the rat's cognitive system needed to re-taste the sugar in order to know that the former reward had become unpleasant and was no longer a positive goal. To the extent that computational models aim to capture real psychological cognition, retasting may remain an important feature of many model-based systems <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Niv1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Niv2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Daw1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Redish2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Redish3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>Of course an empirical need for retasting by rat brains (or human brains) does not necessarily imply that all model-based RL computational mechanisms necessarily require retasting. Recently, Daw, Niv and Dayan have explicitly proposed an alternative tree model that can update without needing to retaste, using feedforward recalculation of goal value in a full look-ahead tree even before the goal is experienced <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Daw1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Daw2" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>. Such a model might be able to accomplish revaluations of CS value prior to UCS retasting such as those demonstrated in our experiments.</p><p>Yet differences remain between our Pavlovian-guided incentive salience model (mediated by mesolimbic brain circuits) and a cognitive map or full look-ahead tree model (plausibly mediated by cortical brain circuits) <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Daw1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Daw2" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>. One difference is that attribution of incentive salience to a CS makes the cue itself become motivationally &#x02018;wanted&#x02019;, beyond being a signal or trigger to &#x02018;want&#x02019; the UCS goal <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson3" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Mahler1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. Another difference is that mesolimbic circuits computing <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> modulate only the primary reward motivation and not state-values or state-action values. Loosely speaking, our model (Eqns 3; 3a; 3b) is analogous to one-step look-ahead in a model-based (tree-search) approach. Consider that cue-triggered &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; shoots up upon presentation of a CS, but importantly, also goes down again nearly as soon as the CS is taken away. Coupling to CS is evident in behavioral PIT experiments, where lever-pressing peaks fade away as soon as the CS is removed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000437-g004">figure 4</xref>) &#x02013; even though the salt appetite, dopamine drug, or sensitization state that enhanced the cue's motivation-eliciting power persist. Neuronal VP firing peaks are even shorter, and linked to the onset of the CS presentation, and then typically decay within a second. Neither baseline levels of lever pressing rates nor neuronal firing rates were reliably enhanced at moments in between cues.</p><p>A full tree-model is usually thought to have an advantage of providing a stable cognitive map of declarative goals and available actions within the tree's representation of the world. Having once successfully recomputed the goal in advance of retasting the UCS, then, it may seem odd that a full look-ahead tree model should immediately abandon the goal value again as soon as the CS disappears, and to repeat the cycle each time the CS comes or goes. Yet to accommodate our data, some such transient and repetitive adjustment of a full-tree model would be required.</p><p>Transience, on the other hand, is quite typical of motivational states. In particular, the incentive salience mechanism is especially compatible with transient peaks in &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; being tied to CS presence because the Bindra-Toates rules of Pavlovian motivation specify that a synergy exists between CS presence and current mesolimbic state, which controls the intensity of motivation at each moment <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Toates1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge12" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>. The physical presence of a Pavlovian CS is a crucial factor in generating incentive salience, and a sporadic CS can lead to up-and-down changes in &#x02018;wanting&#x02019;. This synergy feature is precisely why hungers make their relevant cues much more powerful motivators, as well as why a food CS can trigger an increase in appetite for its UCS in a not particularly hungry person or a drug CS trigger relapse in an addict <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Toates1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson4" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge12" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Petrovich1" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b2"><title>Multiple motivation-learning systems</title><p>We should acknowledge again that we do not suggest that incentive salience is the only computational form of goal-directed system operating in the brains of rats or people, any more than stimulus-stimulus Pavlovian associations are the only form of reward learning. Incentive salience &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; is but one mechanism of motivation, occurring alongside others. For example, ample evidence described elsewhere indicates that &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; (with quotation marks: incentive salience) exists alongside ordinary wanting (without quotation marks: cognitive predictions), which may plausibly be based on full look-ahead cognitive representations of expected goal values and their related act-outcome strategies to obtain those goals <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dayan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Dickinson2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Ordinarily, wanting and &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; act together to guide behavior toward the same goals, with incentive salience serving to add motivation &#x02018;oomph&#x02019; to cognitive representations. But under some important conditions the two motivation mechanisms may diverge. For example, divergence can lead to &#x02018;irrational wanting&#x02019; in addiction for a target that the individual does not cognitively want, nor predictively expect to be of high value <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge5" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Our current model may help to computationally capture the incentive salience limb of that divergence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Future challenges</title><p>Finally, we stress that our model (Eqns 3, 3a, 3b) is not meant as a finished model of incentive salience, but only is an incremental step towards more adequate computational models. Several important challenges remain. One challenge for a future incentive salience model is to better solve the specificity problem involved in the question of &#x02018;what to want most&#x02019;&#x0003f; That problem includes describing how specific types of <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> (e.g., sodium appetite, hunger, drug sensitization) interact with specific CSs and their UCS rewards (e.g., salt, food, drugs) to determine the direction of maximal attribution of incentive salience toward a particular target. A related problem concerns the control of how sharply &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; is focused by amygdala-related systems on one CS motivational magnet <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Flagel1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Mahler1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>, or on one UCS target in a winner-take-all fashion (as when an addict excessively &#x02018;wants&#x02019; only drugs), or instead is spread somewhat over several targets (as when the addict also excessively &#x02018;wants&#x02019; to gamble or engage in sex) <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Another challenge is to model the relation of incentive salience &#x02018;reboosting&#x02019; (via incremental pairings of CS and UCS) to dynamic modulation (as shown here for a specific CS). A final challenge is to better capture the computational differences between Pavlovian-based &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; described here versus tree-based cognitive goal systems and cached-based habit learning systems, and to better understand the conditions that determine whether those three systems cohere or diverge.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To summarize, we have proposed a computational model of incentive salience as a motivational gating mechanism that dynamically responds to post-learning shifts in physiological states when encoding a relevant CS for reward. Our computation of incentive salience integrates a current change in physiological state with previously learned associations between a CS and its state-relevant UCS reward to generate &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; in a dynamic and reversible fashion.</p><p>The computation of incentive salience outlined here implies that cue-triggered &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; amounts to activating associations that exist between CS and UCS, and then dynamically recomputing motivational value based on current physiological state to generate the motivational magnet property of a reward cue <xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Berridge3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000437-Robinson2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In natural appetites, like salt appetite or food hunger, the dynamic modulation is adaptive, and guides motivated behavior towards an appropriate incentive without need for stable experience-gained knowledge of the goal.
