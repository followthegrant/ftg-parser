Our aim was to evaluate the compliance of GPs with these guidelines three years later.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We used &#x0201c;e&#x0201d; case vignette methodology for this non interventional study. A national panel of randomly selected GPs was included. We used eight &#x0201c;e&#x0201d; case-vignettes relating to chronic pain, differing in terms of the type of pain (neuropathic/non neuropathic), etiology (cancer, postoperative pain, low back pain with or without radicular pain, diabetes) and symptoms. GPs received two randomly selected consecutive &#x0201c;e&#x0201d; case vignettes (with/without neuropathic pain). We analyzed their ability to recognize neuropathic pain and to prescribe appropriate first-line treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>From the 1265 GPs in the database, we recruited 443 (35.0%), 334 of whom logged onto the web site (26.4%) and 319 (25.2%) of whom completed the survey. Among these GPs, 170 (53.3%) were aware of the guidelines, 136 (42.6%) were able to follow them, and 110 (34.5%) used the DN4 diagnostic tool. Sensitivity for neuropathic pain recognition was 87.8% (CI: 84.2%; 91.4%). However, postoperative neuropathic pain was less well diagnosed (77.9%; CI: 69.6%; 86.2%) than diabetic pain (95.2%; CI: 90.0%; 100.0%), cancer pain (90.6%; CI: 83.5%; 97.8%) and typical radicular pain (90.7%; CI: 84.9%; 96.5%). When neuropathic pain was correctly recognized, the likelihood of appropriate first-line treatment prescription was 90.6% (CI: 87.4%; 93.8%). The treatments proposed were pregabaline (71.8%), gabapentine (43.9%), amiptriptylline (23.2%) and duloxetine (18.2%). However, ibuprofen (11%), acetaminophen-codeine (29.5%) and clonazepam (10%) were still prescribed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The compliance of GPs with clinical practice guidelines appeared to be satisfactory, but differed between etiologies.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by Pfizer. The sponsor financed the data collection and statistical analysis of the data, which was performed by an independent clinical research organization (ITEC, Bordeaux, France).

Classical causes of neuropathic pain include diabetes, shingles, spinal cord injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, cancer and HIV infection, but also more common conditions, such as radicular pain related to radiculopathy, and traumatic or postsurgical nerve injuries <xref rid="pone.0093855-Attal1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Several large epidemiological surveys have highlighted the under-treatment of neuropathic pain in France in either the general population <xref rid="pone.0093855-Attal2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> or in specialist settings <xref rid="pone.0093855-Bouhassira1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Screening tools have been developed to increase the awareness and recognition of neuropathic pain, particularly by non-specialists <xref rid="pone.0093855-Bouhassira2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093855-Bouhassira3" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The use of these tools may also contribute to reduce false positive diagnoses, which are probably also common in clinical practice.</p><p>Evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of neuropathic pain have also been developed in recent years <xref rid="pone.0093855-Finnerup1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093855-Attal3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In France, the French Pain Society (<italic>Soci&#x000e9;t&#x000e9; Fran&#x000e7;aise d'Etude et Traitement de la Douleur</italic>/SFETD), in particular, has proposed and disseminated evidence-based recommendations targeting all health professionals, with the aim of facilitating neuropathic pain recognition and management in the ambulatory care setting <xref rid="pone.0093855-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These recommendations emphasize the importance of screening tools (particularly the DN4, which was developed in France <xref rid="pone.0093855-Bouhassira2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) as a first step in the diagnosis of neuropathic pain, and propose first- and second-line drug treatments for neuropathic pain, regardless of its etiology, akin to European or international recommendations.</p><p>However, very few studies have investigated the real-life impact of evidence-based recommendations on physicians' practices. In the USA, a study by Dworkin and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0093855-Dworkin2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> suggested that the drug treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia by primary care physicians was roughly consistent with the US recommendations issued some years before. However, this study was retrospective and restricted to post-herpetic neuralgia, a condition that is easier for non-specialists to diagnose than many other neurological pain conditions.</p><p>Our aim in this study was to describe chronic neuropathic pain management practices among general practitioners (GPs), focusing on the criteria used in decision-making processes and compliance with current French recommendations. We used &#x0201c;case vignettes&#x0201d;, a valid and reliable method that is gaining widespread acceptance for quality-of-care assessments in current clinical practice <xref rid="pone.0093855-Peabody1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093855-Bachmann1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This method provides an effective evaluation of the behavior of physicians in the setting of diagnosis or treatment decisions, and of their compliance with recommendations. It therefore appeared an appropriate method in the context of the objectives of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with French regulatory requirements. The protocol and all administrative documents, including the financial agreement, with investigators paid for their participation, were approved by the National Medical Council (<italic>Conseil National de l'Ordre des M&#x000e9;decins</italic>; CNOM). The database was declared to the National Data Protection Authority (<italic>Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libert&#x000e9;s</italic>; CNIL). Submission to an ethics committee was not required under French law.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Selection of participants</title><p>We calculated that a sample of 300 GPs would be required to estimate any percentage with a maximum 95% CI of &#x000b1;6.5%, taking into account a design effect related to the non-independence of observations made by the same physician. The rate of participation in e-CRF studies is generally about 30%, with 75% of participants being highly active. We therefore decided to select a representative random sample of 1,332 GPs for this study. To this end, we sent a questionnaire, by mail, to the 84,832 GPs practicing in mainland France (listed in the CEGEDIM database), on January 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2012, asking them whether they would be interested in participating in a non-interventional study. We selected a random sample of 1,332 physicians from the 4,299 GPs who expressed interest in participating in this study between January and July 2012. Contact information was incorrect for 67 GPs, so 1,265 GPs were finally included in our database. In October 2012, we sent these GPs a proposal for participation in this survey. Any physician who did not respond to this mailing was contacted by telephone two weeks later, and attempts at contact were continued until the planned number of participants was reached. In total, 465 GPs agreed to take part in this survey, of whom 443 signed a contract for participation and were issued with a center number. The flow chart for GP selection is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093855-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0093855-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0093855.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flow chart of the study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0093855.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Construction of case-vignettes</title><p>Case vignettes were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts (authors of this paper) in the field of neuropathic pain, practicing as GPs, clinicians or nurses in neurology or anesthesiology. The description of clinical cases was based on epidemiological and descriptive data characterizing neuropathic pain <xref rid="pone.0093855-Bouhassira4" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Each clinical case was designed to be realistic and concrete, matching as closely as possible the cases observed in clinical practice. We focused on four etiologies of peripheral neuropathic pain frequently encountered in general medical practice: painful diabetic polyneuropathy, cancer chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy <xref rid="pone.0093855-Bennett2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, typical radicular pain <xref rid="pone.0093855-Freynhagen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and post-operative neuropathic pain <xref rid="pone.0093855-Martinez2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093855-Johansen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In assessments of performance for the identification of neuropathic pain, we considered two types of chronic pain for each etiology: nociceptive chronic pain and peripheral neuropathic pain. Based on these conditions, we constructed eight case-vignettes, each with a different scenario. The eight case-vignettes are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093855.s001">File S1</xref>.</p><p>The scenario needed to be simple, brief (length &#x0003c;15 lines-200 words), with no potential pitfalls. Each case-vignette was constructed in the same way: age, sex, patient's history, chronic pain history, reason for consultation, clinical symptoms, data from clinical examination, with or without results from additional investigations.</p><p>Scenarios differed in terms of both symptoms (e.g. burning pain <italic>vs</italic> aching pain) and elements of clinical examination (e.g. allodynia <italic>vs</italic> pain triggered by joint mobilization). The symptoms and clinical examination findings leading to the diagnosis of neuropathic pain were chosen from among the most discriminative, although none of them is specific <xref rid="pone.0093855-Bouhassira2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093855-Dworkin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093855-Woolf1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and were consistent with those used in validated screening tools, such as the DN4 (<italic>Douleur neuropathique en 4 questions</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0093855-Bouhassira2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Clinical cases of neuropathic pain included at least six discriminative neuropathic elements, whereas non-neuropathic cases presented fewer than two neuropathic characteristics (see cases n&#x000b0;7 and 8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093855.s001">File S1</xref>).</p><p>Non-discriminative clinical elements of neuropathic pain were systematically included in the description of all clinical cases: high pain intensity on a numerical rating scale (&#x0003e;7/10) and comorbid conditions (anxiety, depression).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Construction of the case-vignette questionnaire</title><p>The proposed questions and their corresponding items dealt with the different elements for the diagnosis and management of neuropathic pain set out in SFETD recommendations (see Key points in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093855.s001">File S1</xref>). The construction of this closed-ended questionnaire superimposed over the recommendations made it possible to carry out a relevant assessment of knowledge and facilitated the analysis of responses. The number of questions and items was the same for each case. The knowledge of the GPs was assessed through four multiple-choice questions: i) diagnostic elements, four items, ii) elements from the patient's clinical history guiding diagnosis, four items, iii) elements from clinical examination guiding diagnosis, three items, iv) drugs proposed for first-line treatment, seven items.</p><p>The case-vignette questionnaire is shown in in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0093855.s001">File S1</xref>.

By combining these vignettes two-by-two (one neuropathic case and one non-neuropathic case), we obtained 12 possible combinations, which we tested on 20 GPs, to evaluate their comprehensibility. This testing step identified two combinations as too similar to each other (diabetic polyneuropathy and cancer chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy), and these combinations were therefore removed. Each GP had to provide a response for a set of two case-vignettes randomly selected from the 10 remaining combinations. GPs were blind to the mode of case distribution.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0093855-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0093855.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>The eight case-vignettes.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0093855-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0093855.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neuropathic pain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-neuropathic pain</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diabetes</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Case 1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Case 2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cancer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Case 3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Case 4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low back pain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Case 5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Case 6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Postoperative pain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Case 7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Case 8</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>The case-vignettes were stored in a database on a dedicated server for this survey (a web-based application).

Only 4.7% of the GPs identified all the drugs that could be used as first-line treatments for neuropathic pain. A significant disparity in drug prescriptions was observed, with pregabalin prescribed in 71.8% of cases, gabapentin in 43.9% and amitriptyline in 23.2%. The orders of the prescription rates for these three drugs did not depend on etiology. However, for diabetic polyneuropathy, duloxetine replaced amitriptyline as the third most frequently prescribed drug. The questions relating to therapeutic approaches also revealed that many doctors would prescribe inappropriate drugs, such as acetaminophen/codeine, ibuprofen and clonazepam, which were prescribed in 29.5%, 11% and 10% of cases, respectively.

Three years after the publication of French recommendations on neuropathic pain, this study found that only 58.9% of GPs made the correct diagnosis for both the allocated case vignettes. Neuropathic pain was well diagnosed in 87.8% of cases, but only 53.6% of GPs proposed an appropriate first-line treatment. Based on these figures, less than one in two patients (47.1%) consulting for neuropathic pain would receive appropriate treatment.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Diagnosis of neuropathic pain</title><p>Accurate diagnosis is the crucial first step toward the successful management of neuropathic pain. We were surprised by the high percentage of correct diagnoses of neuropathic pain obtained in this study (87.8%), given the difficulties encountered in the recognition of this type of pain real life <xref rid="pone.0093855-Torrance1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093855-Parsons1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, the clinical cases submitted to the GPs in this study were simple and somewhat caricatured. Our cases of neuropathic pain included at least seven characteristic features of such pain, whereas four elements are sufficient for the diagnosis of NP with the DN4 tool <xref rid="pone.0093855-Bouhassira2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Moreover, it has been shown that the use of closed-ended questionnaires with cued items leads to an overestimate of the performance of physicians <xref rid="pone.0093855-Pham1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The sponsorship of this study by a laboratory heavily involved in research on neuropathic pain may also have resulted in a higher proportion of GPs making the correct diagnosis for neuropathic pain. Thus, although the overall figures appear to be highly satisfactory, further analyses of diagnostic failures can provide us with useful information. Indeed, this detailed analysis identified certain diagnostic difficulties in particular conditions.</p><p>Firstly, the large range of answers obtained, depending on the set of two case-vignettes assigned to the GPs, suggested that diagnosis was not always easy. Some cases, such as painful diabetic polyneuropathy, seemed to be much better diagnosed than others, such as postoperative neuropathic pain. We also observed an overdiagnosis of neuropathic pain in cancer patients. Only one in five GPs recognized both non-neuropathic cancer pain and postoperative neuropathic pain. The overdiagnosis of neuropathic pain in some etiologies and its underdiagnosis in others may reflect GPs continuing to think that the nature of pain depends on either its context or its etiology. Parsons <italic>et al.</italic> recently showed that mean time from the onset of postoperative neuropathic pain symptoms to diagnosis was 9.7 months <xref rid="pone.0093855-Parsons1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Indeed, postoperative pain had long been considered purely, until the widespread recognition about 10 years ago of the neuropathic origin of some postoperative pains <xref rid="pone.0093855-Kehlet1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. By contrast, diabetic neuropathy has been the subject of extensive academic, scientific communication and marketing, potentially accounting for the high frequency of correct diagnosis (92.2%). GPs overdiagnosed neuropathic pain in cancer patients, probably because they were influenced by the background of previous chemotherapy and the presence of two neuropathic elements (e.g. tingling and hypoesthesia) without taking into account clinical presentation (e.g. location of pain away from nerve damage symptoms).</p><p>Overall, these results suggest that limited use is made of the findings of clinical examinations in the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. This hypothesis was confirmed by the analysis of answers relating to the elements of the patient's history and clinical examination leading to the diagnosis of neuropathic pain, which provided us with new insight into the decision-making processes of physicians. Indeed, our results indicate that the elements used to arrive at the correct diagnosis differed between etiologies. In diabetic patients, pain descriptors were used for the identification of neuropathic pain, whereas, in postoperative pain, correct diagnoses were based largely on clinical examination. This is a key point, highlighting the essential nature of clinical examination for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain in general practice. This finding closes the debate about whether clinical examinations should be counted among the screening tools helping non-specialists to identify patients with possible neuropathic pain.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Therapeutic management</title><p>The management of patients with chronic neuropathic pain is challenging, despite attempts to develop a more rational therapeutic approach <xref rid="pone.0093855-Finnerup2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In our study, only one in two GPs proposed at least one of the recommended first-line treatments when faced with a case of confirmed neuropathic pain. This poor result applied to neuropathic pain of all etiologies. Indeed, when multiplied with the probability of prescription of one appropriate first-line treatment, only 69.5%, 46.7%, 40.2% and 40.2% of patients with diabetes, cancer, radicular pain and postoperative pain, respectively, would receive appropriate medical care. These low rates highlight the large proportion of patients that would not have been correctly treated despite the caricatured description of neuropathic pain in the vignettes, its high intensity (7/10 on VAS) and association with sleep disorders and anxiety in all the case-vignettes assigned to the GPs. These findings suggest that the corresponding figures may be even worse in &#x0201c;real life&#x0201d;. As for diagnosis, we observed differences according to etiology with neuropathic pain in diabetic patients much better managed than that in patients presenting with low back pain or postoperative pain.</p><p>Another key finding of our results is the lack of knowledge of evidence-based therapy, with less than 5% of GPs being able to list all the first-line drugs recommended for the treatment of neuropathic pain. This suggests that physicians have a very superficial knowledge of recommendations, such that patients with contraindications or treatment failure might not necessarily receive appropriate treatment. It is probably easier for GPs to remember one drug per disease, even if further inquiries must subsequently be made, rather than remembering algorithms of various complexities. Pregabalin was by far the most frequently cited drug, regardless of etiology, followed by gabapentin and amitriptyline. This finding may be accounted for by the risk-benefit profile of pregabalin, which is better tolerated and requires fewer precautions for use than amitriptyline <xref rid="pone.0093855-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Finally, this study revealed the persistence of non-recommended drug prescriptions, such as acetaminophen/codeine, ibuprofen or clonazepam. Clonazepam, which belongs to the benzodiazepine class, has been misused and abused and has been subject to prescription limitations imposed by the French authorities since January 2012 <xref rid="pone.0093855-AFFSAPS1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The other drugs in this non-recommended list are very often wrongly prescribed, to one inthree patients for ibuprofen and one in five patients for acetaminophen/codeine. Nevertheless, non-recommended drug prescriptions were less frequent than reported in a recent study investigating the treatment of neuropathic pain in the UK general population <xref rid="pone.0093855-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. An opioid, or a combination of opioid and non-opioid analgesics, was prescribed as a first-line treatment for 25.4% of patients with diabetic neuropathy and 64.0% of patients with neuropathic back pain. By contrast, no benzodiazepine was prescribed. Our results highlight specific issues that should be addressed in the future to optimize the therapeutic management of neuropathic pain in general practice.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Knowledge of SFETD recommendations</title><p>In our study, one in two GPs declared that they knew the recommendations for neuropathic pain. This proportion is similar to published findings from surveys carried out in general practice to assess knowledge about recommendations for six common diseases. However, the percentage of GPs stating that they applied recommendations (42%) was much higher in our study than reported for other diseases (17%) <xref rid="pone.0093855-Clerc1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This led us to question the veracity of the GPs' statements, particularly because we were unable to detect any impact on the recognition of neuropathic pain and its therapeutic management. The remuneration of participation by a pharmaceutical company with considerable involvement in pain management might have favored complaisant responses. We therefore considered the reported implementation of the recommendations by GPs to be too dubious for a relevant assessment of the impact of recommendations on medical practice. Other methodological approaches, such as the assessment of practices before/after the publication of recommendations, or before/after training, would be more appropriate for such an analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Strengths and limitations of case-vignettes</title><p>Case-vignettes have been used for years to evaluate of the behavior of physicians in the setting of diagnostic testing or treatment decisions. We chose to use this method for our study as it has been shown to be an accurate, valid, feasible and inexpensive tool for measuring the quality of health care <xref rid="pone.0093855-Peabody1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093855-Peabody2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093855-Veloski1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093855-Veloski2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093855-Peabody4" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Previous studies have demonstrated the utility of case-vignettes for assessing compliance with recommendations, for measuring physicians' practice performance, particularly for comparisons of different groups of physicians, for identifying deviations from guidelines and physicians with non-ideal approaches to patients due to a lack of knowledge, and for defining areas in which scientific knowledge could be strengthened <xref rid="pone.0093855-Veloski1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093855-Norcini1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093855-Dresselhaus1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>This study had several methodological strengths. Case-vignette design was based on epidemiological and descriptive data for neuropathic pain, which we used to create an initial scenario matching current clinical practice in ambulatory care as closely as possible. Case-vignettes were constructed by an expert panel with six members and were further refined after successful testing on a sample of 20 GPs. The assessment criterion was the recognition of neuropathic pain, and the various items proposed in the questionnaire corresponded to the different diagnostic and therapeutic elements addressed in the French recommendations (pain description, clinical examination, first-line medication).</p><p>However, our study also had a number of limitations. Men were overrepresented, introducing a selection bias. Nevertheless, the likelihood of recognizing or correctly managing neuropathic pain is unlikely to differ between the sexes, and no significant difference according to sex was identified in this study. This research was sponsored by Pfizer, and we cannot rule out the possibility that this influenced GPs' answers, particularly given the overdiagnosis of neuropathic pain observed.</p><p>We selected case-vignettes relating to only four etiologies of chronic pain. The inclusion of a broader range of etiologies would have increased the difficulty of diagnosis and might have generated different results. We presented cases of pure chronic pain that was either neuropathic or nociceptive. The introduction of mixed pain would probably have increased the percentage of misdiagnoses, given the greater complexity of the possible choices.</p><p>Despite the great care that we took to ensure that case-vignettes were similar in terms of difficulty (particularly as concerns the number and quality of neuropathic descriptors included in the cases of neuropathic pain), we cannot rule out the possibility that other difficulties influenced the results. For example, case no. 4, &#x0201c;non-neuropathic cancer pain&#x0201d;, which was one of the worst diagnosed cases, had specific features. It was the only case among the four cases of non-neuropathic pain presenting two neuropathic elements. Moreover, these elements appeared ahead of all the other items proposed whereas, in other cases, they were presented at the end of the list of items. These various aspects highlight the difficulties involved in drawing up case-vignettes. Thus, case-vignettes seem to be a tool that is more useful for highlighting weaknesses on which communication efforts should focus, rather than providing figures concerning medical practice. As previously reported, it is not possible with the case-vignette method to ensure that the responses obtain reflect the way that the GPs would behave in everyday patient care, even if the design and wording of the vignettes are kept as close as possible to real conditions <xref rid="pone.0093855-Dumesnil1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Indeed, this method does not take into account either doctor-patient interactions or the relational aspects involved in real life.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The complexity of neuropathic chronic pain poses challenges for both management and diagnosis for primary care physicians. Taking into account our findings and the limitations outlined above, this study highlights to poor adoption of SFETD recommendations, with difficulties recognizing neuropathic pain for certain etiologies, insufficient consideration of clinical examination findings, and the paucity of appropriate first-line drugs recalled by GPs. These results may facilitate the design of specific educational programs and interventions aiming to improve the management of neuropathic pain by GPs in France.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0093855.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0093855.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0093855-Treede1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
