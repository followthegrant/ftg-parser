The protein profiles underpinning the pathological subtypes and metastatic behavior of MBC are unknown. Using multiplex quantitative tandem mass tag-based proteomics we quantify 5798 proteins in MBC, TNBC, and normal breast from 27 patients. Comparing MBC and TNBC protein profiles we&#x000a0;show MBC-specific increases related to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and extracellular matrix, and reduced metabolic pathways.

Comparison of the proteomes of human spindle MBC with mouse spindle (<italic>CCN6</italic> knockout) MBC tumors reveals a shared spindle-specific signature of 17 upregulated proteins involved in translation and 19 downregulated proteins with roles in cell metabolism.

The most lethal subtype of TNBC is termed metaplastic breast carcinomas (MBC), a unique and heterogeneous group that account for 0.2&#x02012;5% of all breast cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. MBCs are characterized by the presence of a glandular epithelial component and a hallmark non-glandular metaplastic component that may consist of cells with spindle, squamous, and/or sarcomatoid (i.e., chondroid or osseous) features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Clinically, MBCs are more metastatic and chemoresistant than non-metaplastic TNBC, with the spindle subtype reported to have the worst prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This significant clinical challenge highlights the need to distinguish MBC tumors for diagnostic and precision treatment purposes.</p><p id="Par4">The molecular alterations that distinguish MBC from TNBC, and the protein profiles that determine MBC histological subtypes are poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. To date, few studies have investigated the genomic and transcriptomic features of MBC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Genetically, MBCs have a high level of genomic instability, display a complex copy number variation pattern, and tend to harbor significantly more mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>WNT</italic>, and <italic>TP53</italic> compared with TNBCs, as well as presenting loss of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and overexpression and amplification of <italic>EGFR</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Studies have been unable to show a genetic basis among MBC histologic subtypes, but have recently demonstrated distinct profiles at the transcriptomic level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, little is known about the mechanisms of MBC metastasis, and there are no reliable biomarkers or targets of therapy, underscoring the need to identify protein profiles specific to MBC and subtypes.</p><p id="Par5">Our lab has generated MMTV-cre;Ccn6<sup>fl/fl</sup> knockout mice which form mammary tumors that recapitulate high-grade human MBC with predominant spindle components both morphologically and transcriptionally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Using this model, we have identified an 87-gene signature common between mouse and human MBCs including the transcription and translation regulatory proteins HMGA2 and IGF2BP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

Here, we use human tissue samples of MBC, TNBC, and normal breast and a quantitative custom-built platform to test the hypothesis that the histological subtypes of MBC may have distinct protein profiles that may result in their pathological phenotypic diversity and aggressive clinical behavior. We employ tandem mass tag (TMT) based proteomics technology and Philosopher/TMT-Integrator, a computational pipeline that our group has recently developed and optimized for the analysis of large patient cohorts, to process the acquired mass spectrometry data. By unraveling the protein signatures within MBC and their relationship to TNBC and normal breast tissue, our study advances the understanding of the biology of MBC and provides potential diagnostic and prognostic markers, as well as testable targets of therapy specific to MBC pathological subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Human samples and clinical data</title><p id="Par7">To elucidate the proteomic profile of MBC and understand the differences in protein expression with TNBC and normal breast tissues, we assembled a clinical cohort of 15 frozen MBC which were classified clinically according to their predominant metaplastic component into the following subtypes: spindle (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6), squamous (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4), and sarcomatoid (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5).

However, studies to date have focused on frequent subtypes of breast cancer, with few to no MBC cases and normal breast tissues.</p><p id="Par19">Our initial unsupervised clustering among the samples correlated with the tumor histopathology demonstrating a clear distinction between normal and all tumors (MBC subtypes and TNBC) and between MBC squamous and sarcomatoid, while there was an overlap between MBC subtypes and TNBC, supporting the hypothesis that MBC and TNBC have both common and distinct proteomic profiles that have not&#x000a0;been&#x000a0;characterized so far. Upon in-depth cross-analyses of MBC to both TNBC and normal tissues, and between each MBC subtype using GO and MSigDB databases, common and subtype-specific differences within MBCs and in relationship to TNBC emerged. Compared with TNBC, the proteome of MBC has a highly enriched EMT phenotype, with increased inflammatory responses (mainly in spindle and squamous), an active ECM, and reduced oxidative phosphorylation. These data are consistent with our previous studies showing that MBC express proteins involved in the EMT process, which may contribute to a more stem-like and aggressive phenotype than TNBC, and with transcriptome studies showing that MBCs cluster as basal-like and claudin-low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Subtype-specific proteins and pathways emerged when we compared proteomic profiles of spindle, squamous and sarcomatoid tumors. A salient feature of spindle MBCs, which are highly proliferative and exhibit pathological evidence of EMT with elongated cancer cells, is upregulated expression of E2F and MYC pathway proteins, ribosomal proteins and transcriptional and translational processes. These findings are intriguing based on data showing that E2F and MYC are key drivers of cancer cell proliferation and EMT processes, where ribosome biogenesis and increased translation play an essential role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

On the other hand, sarcomatoid MBC, which includes chondroid and osseous differentiation, exhibit a predominance in extracellular matrix signaling cascades and an amplified EMT program, increased oxidative phosphorylation, and decreased inflammatory responses compared with both spindle and squamous subtypes, likely owing to its differentiation along mesenchymal lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Also, we observed that in general, there is no significant difference in TP53 and PI3K pathways between MBCs and TNBC.
