Moreover, TopBP1 is required for focus formation of the structure-selective nuclease and scaffold protein SLX4 in mitosis. Persistent TopBP1 foci transition into 53BP1 nuclear bodies (NBs) in G1 and precise temporal depletion of TopBP1 just before mitotic entry induced formation of 53BP1 NBs in the next cell cycle, showing that TopBP1 acts to reduce transmission of DNA damage to G1 daughter cells. Based on these results, we propose that TopBP1 maintains genome integrity in mitosis by controlling chromatin recruitment of SLX4 and by facilitating unscheduled DNA synthesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s01"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maintaining genome stability is of paramount importance for cell viability, and if compromised, may ultimately lead to development of cancer and other genetic diseases. The two key events that secure an intact copy of the genome for each daughter cell are (1) complete replication of the genome in S phase and (2) subsequent correct segregation of chromosomes in mitosis. The bulk of DNA replication is normally restricted to S phase, and ATR-dependent checkpoints support the completion of replication before entry into mitosis (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, in response to replication stress, certain genomic regions termed common fragile sites (CFSs) have a propensity to remain under-replicated at the G2-to-M transition (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Le Beau et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, under-replicated regions refer to DNA that is not fully replicated, but the molecular structures formed at these regions are unknown. Replication stress is a potential driver of the early steps of tumorigenesis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bartkova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Halazonetis et al., 2008</xref>) and as a consequence &#x0003e;50% of recurrent deletions in cancers map to potential CFSs (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Beroukhim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bignell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Le Tallec et al., 2013</xref>). This underscores the importance of understanding cellular processing of under-replicated regions at the late stages of the cell cycle.</p><p>Sister chromatids must be disentangled before they can separate in anaphase. When sister chromatids are fully replicated, this reaction is performed by topoisomerase II&#x02013;mediated decatenation, and most of the genome is decatenated before anaphase onset (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). However, centromeric regions have a propensity to remain catenated in anaphase, giving rise to PICH-coated ultrafine anaphase bridges (UFBs) that are refractory to DAPI staining and are devoid of detectable histones (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baumann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Germann et al., 2014</xref>). During mitosis, under-replicated genomic regions can lead to the formation of various aberrant structures including replication stress&#x02013;induced UFBs, which are distinguished from the centromeric UFBs by the presence of FANCD2 at the base of the bridge (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2009</xref>). In the following G1, under-replicated regions can nucleate 53BP1 nuclear bodies (53BP1 NBs) that protect the under-replicated DNA from untimely processing (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Harrigan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lukas et al., 2011</xref>). We have previously shown that TopBP1 colocalizes with PICH on a subset of UFBs (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Germann et al., 2014</xref>). TopBP1 is a multifunctional protein involved in initiation of DNA replication, ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000e4;kiniemi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Van Hatten et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Yamane et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kumagai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Germann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), but its exact role if any in mitosis is unclear.</p><p>Here we have investigated the role of TopBP1 during mitosis. Using endogenous fluorescent tagging in the avian cell line DT40, we have determined the choreography of TopBP1, PICH, 53BP1, FANCD2, and RPA. The fusion genes are under control of the endogenous promoter, allowing us to follow physiologically relevant concentrations of tagged proteins. We show that mitotic entry coincides with a dramatic increase in the number of TopBP1 foci, some of which persist throughout mitosis and transition into 53BP1 NBs in G1. We find that all RPA foci and most FANCD2 foci colocalize with mitotic TopBP1, and TopBP1 consistently localizes to replication stress&#x02013;induced gaps and breaks on metaphase chromosomes, which is a common feature of CFSs. Importantly, we report two new functions of TopBP1 in mitosis. First, TopBP1 binds to under-replicated regions to support unscheduled DNA synthesis in mitosis. Second, TopBP1 is required for focus formation of the structure-selective nuclease SLX4, which promotes the resolution of recombinational repair intermediates (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fekairi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mu&#x000f1;oz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Svendsen et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, precise temporal depletion of TopBP1 just before mitotic entry leads to a dramatic increase in 53BP1 NBs in G1 that may arise from combined defects in DNA synthesis at under-replicated regions and SLX4-mediated sister chromatid resolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Entry into mitosis is accompanied by a burst in TopBP1 foci</title><p>During our previous study of TopBP1 localization in anaphase (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Germann et al., 2014</xref>), we noticed that TopBP1 was present throughout mitosis. This prompted us to perform quantitative studies of TopBP1 localization during mitosis. First, we analyzed TopBP1 localization from 5 min before nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) until 5 min before anaphase onset. Using time-lapse microscopy, we analyzed a DT40 cell line expressing endogenous fluorescently tagged TopBP1. This showed that TopBP1 formed foci in mitosis at a frequency that increased 20-fold at NEBD and subsequently decreased 2.3-fold until anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>TopBP1 foci accumulate upon NEBD and gradually disappear during progression of mitosis.</bold> (A) Quantification of TopBP1 foci in mitosis in avian DT40 and human HeLa cells.

Low concentrations of APH cause mild replication stress, allowing cells to enter mitosis with under-replicated DNA, whereas ICRF-193 inhibits decatenation by topoisomerase II. After exposure to APH for 20 h, TopBP1 foci were induced even before NEBD, and the frequency of TopBP1 foci was also mildly elevated at the subsequent time points in mitosis compared with the solvent-treated control. ICRF-193 exposure for 30 min before acquiring the time-lapse images also resulted in a mild induction of TopBP1 foci at the subsequent time points after NEBD.</p><p>To recapitulate our characterization of TopBP1 in a human cell line, we examined HeLa cells transiently expressing human GFP-TopBP1 and hH2B-mCherry. The quantification of TopBP1 foci in mitotic HeLa cells closely resembled that of DT40, showing that TopBP1 foci form at the onset of mitosis and decrease in number thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and D</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the accumulation of TopBP1 foci at NEBD is due to its fluorescent tag, we performed immunofluorescence of endogenous TopBP1 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Quantification of immunostained TopBP1 foci again revealed a large number of foci at prometaphase, with the number of foci decreasing as cells progressed through mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Importantly, the immunostaining signal was completely abolished upon RNAi knockdown of TopBP1 (unpublished data).</p><p>During our studies of both human and chicken TopBP1 in mitosis, we also observed TopBP1 at the centrosomes (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Reini et al., 2004</xref>), and TopBP1 foci with a thread-like appearance, which did not always overlap with chromatin marked by hH2B-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B&#x02013;D</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502107/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>). For simplicity we refer to all TopBP1 structures colocalizing with hH2B-mCherry as foci.</p><p>In conclusion, mitotic entry coincides with a burst of TopBP1 foci of which approximately half disappear again during progression through mitosis. The frequency of TopBP1 foci is slightly induced by replication stress or topoisomerase II inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>TopBP1 colocalizes with FANCD2 and RPA during mitosis</title><p>To investigate the nature of mitotic TopBP1 foci, we monitored the colocalization of TopBP1 and FANCD2 in preanaphase cells (prometaphase/metaphase). APH-induced replication stress induced an approximately twofold increase in both solitary FANCD2 foci and FANCD2 foci colocalizing with TopBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). FANCD2 has been shown to form so-called sister foci at under-replicated regions including CFSs in mitosis (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Naim and Rosselli, 2009</xref>). Similarly, we observed FANCD2 sister foci in mitosis (Fig. S1 C), and TopBP1 colocalized with approximately half of the FANCD2 foci but rarely with both of the FANCD2 sister foci. Specifically, for 71% of FANCD2 sister foci at least one of the sister foci was colocalizing with TopBP1 (35 out of 49).</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>TopBP1 colocalizes with FANCD2 in mitosis and binds to gaps and breaks on metaphase chromosomes. </bold>(A) Representative images of the APH-treated DT40 cell line, RTP284 (PICH<sup>TFP/WT</sup>/FANCD2<sup>Venus/WT</sup>/TopBP1<sup>mCherry/WT/WT</sup>).

In response to APH, a 12-fold increase in the number of macrochromosomes with TopBP1 present at gaps/breaks was observed. Furthermore, TopBP1 localization at the chromosome ends is doubled in response to APH. Finally, we observed 5% of macrochromosomes with a TopBP1 focus at an internal site, and this category did not respond to APH. Thus, TopBP1 at internal sites and at chromosome ends are the main contributors of TopBP1 foci in unperturbed cells, whereas most of the APH-induced TopBP1 foci localize to gaps/breaks on metaphase chromosomes.</p><p>To obtain further insight into the DNA structures that are bound by TopBP1, we monitored colocalization of TopBP1 and the single strand binding protein RPA in preanaphase cells. RPA foci were only observed after treatment with APH or ICRF-193, but in these cases they virtually always colocalized with TopBP1 and FANCD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>; and Fig. S1, D and E).</p><p>In conclusion, our data show that a subset of TopBP1 foci colocalizes with FANCD2 sister foci in mitosis and that TopBP1 binds to gaps and breaks on metaphase chromosomes, both of which are established hallmarks of replication stress at CFSs (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Durkin and Glover, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s05"><title>The majority of TopBP1 foci remain on chromatin into anaphase</title><p>Our characterization of TopBP1 in early mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) revealed that a fraction of mitotic TopBP1 foci persists after anaphase onset.

A fraction of these structures were PICH negative and never stretched out to fully bridge the sister chromatin masses. We therefore refer to such structures as UFB-likes (UFB-ls), because PICH is not present to verify the existence of a bona fide UFB. Furthermore, we observed PICH UFBs devoid of TopBP1 as well as chromatin-associated TopBP1 foci that did not localize to UFBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Consistent with our recent work (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Germann et al., 2014</xref>), we found that the occurrence of TopBP1-bound PICH UFBs is much lower than TopBP1 UFB-ls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Notably, the fraction of TopBP1-bound PICH UFBs is induced four- and twofold by APH and ICRF-193 treatment, respectively, whereas the frequency of noncolocalizing TopBP1 UFB-ls remained unchanged after APH treatment and decreased twofold in response to ICRF-193 treatment.</p><p>Our analysis also revealed that a large proportion of TopBP1 foci in anaphase and telophase are associated with the separating chromosome masses, distinguishing them from UFBs or UFB-ls. TopBP1 foci were induced in response to APH and ICRF-193 treatment. Surprisingly, a substantial fraction of PICH UFBs and TopBP1 foci contained 53BP1 already in mitosis, despite the recent findings that 53BP1 is actively excluded from chromatin in mitosis in human cells (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Orthwein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). In contrast, 53BP1 rarely colocalized with TopBP1 UFB-ls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). The analysis showed that the various categories of TopBP1 UFBs and UFB-ls respond differently to replication stress or topoisomerase II inhibition and likely represent different molecular structures.</p><p>To further clarify whether TopBP1-bound UFBs result from replication stress, we performed time-lapse microscopy on the DT40 cell line expressing fluorescently tagged TopBP1, FANCD2, and PICH. In agreement with previous reports, we observed that FANCD2 associated with a subset of UFBs after APH treatment (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Naim and Rosselli, 2009</xref>). Within this subset, FANCD2 localized either to the UFB termini and/or the central part of the UFB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). TopBP1 colocalized with FANCD2, either at the central part of the bridge or at one of the termini. The vast majority (98%) of TopBP1-bound UFBs were also associated with FANCD2 foci. In most instances, TopBP1 foci specifically colocalized with FANCD2 on the UFBs (90%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). Thus, TopBP1-bound UFBs correspond to the previously described FANCD2-associated UFBs, which are often linked to CFSs in human cells.</p><p>In summary, our results show that the majority of TopBP1 foci, which persist into anaphase in untreated cells, remain chromatin-associated (54%) and a substantial fraction become UFB-ls (42%), while only a small fraction localize to FANCD2-associated UFBs (4%).</p></sec><sec id="s06"><title>Persistent TopBP1 foci transition into 53BP1 NBs</title><p>To follow the fate of the persistent TopBP1 foci from anaphase/telophase into G1, time-lapse microscopy was used.

Most TopBP1 foci (&#x0003e;92%) in early G1 colocalized with 53BP1 NBs both with and without APH or ICRF-193 treatment, and both agents induced TopBP1 and 53BP1 colocalizing foci (1.5- and 2.2-fold, respectively).

However, in a substantial number of time-lapse series, TopBP1 foci could be tracked from M into G1, allowing us to directly address which TopBP1 structures in mitosis transitioned into 53BP1 NBs in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The majority (82%) of the trackable TopBP1-associated 53BP1 NBs derived from chromatin-associated TopBP1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). A small fraction of the trackable foci derived from UFBs (8%), or from the base of UFBs (10%), and the frequency of such events was increased by treatment with ICRF-193, APH, or the replication-blocking agent arabinofuranosyl cytidine (araC; Fig. S2). 53BP1 NBs were never observed to derive from UFB-ls or PICH-covered UFBs devoid of TopBP1.</p><p>Some UFBs were resolved early in anaphase and were therefore not trackable into G1. Assuming that such UFBs could turn into foci upon breakage or resolution, we predict that they would become TopBP1 foci facing the midzone. Thus we classified TopBP1 foci on separating chromosome masses into (1) centrosome facing (including foci in the central part of the chromosomes) or (2) midzone facing, and we determined the contribution of these two classes of TopBP1 foci to 53BP1 NBs in the following G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). The localization of TopBP1 foci that transition into 53BP1 NBs from the midzone region (43%) or from the centrosome facing region (57%) appeared largely random, suggesting that most 53BP1 NBs arise from TopBP1 foci that do not derive from UFBs.</p><p>In conclusion, persistent chromatin-associated TopBP1 foci frequently transition into 53BP1 NBs in the following G1, whereas UFB-ls and PICH-covered UFBs devoid of TopBP1 do not transition to 53BP1 NBs. Similar to TopBP1 foci, the TopBP1-bound UFBs also transition into 53BP1 NBs. However, due to their low abundance, their contribution is small. These data indicate that TopBP1 associates with a type of DNA structure that is likely to be transmitted as DNA damage to G1 daughter cells.</p></sec><sec id="s07"><title>TopBP1 colocalizes with sites of DNA synthesis in the G2/M phase</title><p>The gradual disappearance of TopBP1 foci during mitosis along with our finding that mitotic TopBP1 foci transition into 53BP1 NBs in G1 is indicative of ongoing DNA repair in mitosis. Moreover, our observation that TopBP1 foci are induced by APH and colocalize with FANCD2 suggests that a subset of TopBP1 foci in mitosis represents under-replicated DNA. Thus, we hypothesized that TopBP1 foci would colocalize with sites of DNA synthesis, similar to recent work showing that under-replicated regions including CFSs are sites of unscheduled DNA synthesis in mitosis or late G2 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bergoglio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bhat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Eykelenboom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Naim et al., 2013</xref>).

To test this, we pulsed APH-treated cells with EdU with or without IAA-induced TopBP1 depletion just before mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Depletion of TopBP1 resulted in a 1.7-fold reduction of APH-induced EdU incorporation in mitotic cells. The decrease in DNA synthesis could be complemented by ectopical expression of human TopBP1. To test if TopBP1 promotes DNA synthesis after NEBD, we disrupted the NLS of TopBP1 by deleting the last 17 amino acids of the C terminus (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2014</xref>). This TopBP1 version is almost exclusively cytoplasmic and only gains access to DNA upon NEBD, yet this version of TopBP1 completely reverts the drop in EdU incorporation caused by depletion of endogenous TopBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, D and E</xref>). ATR, which is activated by TopBP1, has an important role in replication fork stabilization (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Petermann and Helleday, 2010</xref>).

Inhibition of ATR per se did not reduce but rather increased APH-induced EdU incorporation, showing that TopBP1 promotes replication independently of ATR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>).

Indeed, we found that TopBP1 depletion in mitosis increased the number of 53BP1 NBs per cell 2.9-fold. In fact, the effect on 53BP1 NB formation seen after depletion of TopBP1 is more severe than the effect of prolonged APH treatment, which resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in 53BP1 NBs per cell. To test whether 53BP1 NBs are affected by a lack of ATR activity, we also treated cells with ATRi during G2/M. To our surprise, ATRi suppressed the formation of 53BP1 NBs. A more detailed analysis of 53BP1 NBs, where 53BP1 NBs were divided into two groups depending on signal intensity, termed weak NBs and strong NBs, showed that a combination of ATRi and TopBP1 depletion results in a threefold induction of weaker 53BP1 NBs, but a 1.8-fold decrease in strong 53BP1 NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). This result could indicate that ATRi inhibits an amplification step that can transform weak 53BP1 NBs into the strong 53BP1 NBs, but confirms that the functional role of TopBP1 in mitosis is independent of ATR kinase activity.</p><fig id="fig7" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Depletion of TopBP1 in mitosis induces 53BP1 NBs in the next G1.</bold> (A) Schematic representation of the experimental setup, showing the duration of time-lapse microscopy and drug treatments relative to cell cycle phase.

In conclusion, TopBP1 is required for SLX4 focus formation in mitosis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s11"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we provide a detailed characterization of the localization of TopBP1 at mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). We reveal that under unperturbed conditions as well as in response to replication stress, entry into mitosis is accompanied by a dramatic increase in chromatin-associated TopBP1 foci, both in HeLa and DT40 cells. In preanaphase cells, TopBP1 foci colocalize with FANCD2. In addition, TopBP1 binds to replication stress&#x02013;induced gaps and breaks on metaphase chromosomes. Collectively, this shows that TopBP1 is recruited to replication stress-induced structures in mitosis. The majority of spontaneous TopBP1 foci localized at chromosome ends and at unbroken chromosomal sites. Future work is required to elucidate the nature of spontaneous mitotic TopBP1 foci. We also observed elongated thread-like TopBP1 structures of up to 3 &#x000b5;m adjacent to the condensed chromatin (Fig. S1). We speculate that these structures may represent recruitment of TopBP1 to loops of uncondensed damaged DNA or deposits of TopBP1 ejected from chromatin during chromosome condensation and/or repair.</p><fig id="fig9" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for TopBP1 localization and function at mitosis. </bold>(top) Overview of TopBP1 structures through mitosis based on our collective quantitative and qualitative data. Bar thicknesses are scaled to reflect the number of foci at a given time point where data were available. Hatched areas mark colocalization with TopBP1. (bottom) Hypothetical model for the functional role of TopBP1 in mitosis. In prometaphase, the sister chromatids remain interlinked by recombination intermediates (A) or unreplicated regions (B). Post-replicative gaps may also persist (C). TopBP1 (red ovals) may be recruited to these structures to facilitate their processing both by facilitating DNA synthesis to fill in unreplicated regions/post-replicative gaps as well as mediating resolution of Holliday junctions by SLX4. Resolution of Holliday junctions prevents formation of chromatin bridges, which may lead to mitotic catastrophe. If repair is not completed before anaphase, TopBP1 persists on DNA as chromatin-associated foci or TopBP1-bound UFBs (green/red thread). Both such structures can turn into 53BP1 NBs (blue ovals) in G1. TopBP1 is also observed on UFB-ls devoid of PICH (red thread). However, TopBP1 UFB-ls never transition into 53BP1 NBs. Likewise, PICH-covered UFBs devoid of TopBP1 (green thread) do not transition into 53BP1 NBs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201502107_Fig9"/></fig><p>During progression of mitosis, the number of TopBP1 foci gradually decreases. However, some TopBP1 foci (12%) persist through anaphase and telophase into G1, and the vast majority of these foci transition into 53BP1 NBs. The recruitment of 53BP1 to some TopBP1-bound structures in mitosis was surprising (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>) because of the recent reports that 53BP1 is actively excluded from chromatin in mitosis in human cells (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Orthwein et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, the mitotic 53BP1 foci contain several orders of magnitude less 53BP1 than the prominent 53BP1 NBs in G1 estimated from the fluorescence intensity of 53BP1 foci. Hence, the ability to detect 53BP1 foci in mitosis may be a matter of fluorophore detection level. Alternatively, 53BP1 exclusion from mitotic chromatin is less efficient in chicken DT40 cells compared with human cells. Nevertheless, the frequency of 53BP1 structures in anaphase is significantly lower than that of TopBP1 structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>).</p><p>In anaphase, TopBP1 forms three distinct structures: UFBs, UFB-ls, and foci. The UFB-ls decrease in number in response to DNA damage&#x02013;inducing drugs contrary to TopBP1 UFBs and foci. Thus UFB-ls most likely represent a distinct type of mitotic structure that does not share the same origin as foci or UFBs.</p><p>In line with the findings reported by <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lukas et al. (2011)</xref>, we find that the majority of UFBs do not give rise to 53BP1 NBs in G1. However, the TopBP1-bound UFBs transition into 53BP1 NB with a similar frequency to that of TopBP1 foci on chromatin, indicating that these TopBP1 structures are equally genotoxic. Yet the higher abundance of TopBP1 foci on chromatin compared with TopBP1-bound UFBs (ratio 7:1) accounts for the observation that the major source (92%) of inherited DNA damage visualized as 53BP1 NBs in G1 is chromatin-associated TopBP1 foci.</p><p>We speculate that the gradual disappearance of TopBP1 foci in prometaphase and metaphase reflects repair of under-replicated regions and/or resolution of repair intermediates. Supportive of this notion, we show that TopBP1 localizes to and promotes unscheduled DNA synthesis in mitosis. Furthermore, TopBP1 is responsible for recruitment of the structure-selective nuclease and scaffold protein SLX4 to chromatin in mitosis. These data suggest that TopBP1 acts as a last-minute savior to (1) promote DNA synthesis at under-replicated regions and to (2) direct SLX4-mediated resolution of persistent replication and DNA repair intermediates in mitosis. Consistently, depletion of TopBP1 around mitosis leads to an induction of 53BP1 NBs in the following G1, and the effect is more severe than complete inhibition of DNA replication in mitosis. Interestingly, two studies recently highlighted the critical role of SLX4&#x02019;s SUMO-dependent functions in the replication stress response including suppression of chromatin bridges and 53BP1 NBs (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Guervilly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Ouyang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The TopBP1-mediated stimulation of DNA synthesis could depend on the recruitment of SLX4 for homologous recombination&#x02013;mediated restart of replication forks. Alternatively, TopBP1 recruits polymerases or replication fork remodelers to promote unscheduled DNA synthesis (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000e4;kiniemi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). The exact mechanisms by which TopBP1 facilitates DNA synthesis in mitosis will be subject to future studies.</p><p>Only a small fraction of TopBP1 foci colocalized with EdU incorporation, which may reflect that not all TopBP1-bound DNA damage requires DNA synthesis for repair or could be due to the detection limit of our assay. To test the latter hypothesis, we determined if prolonged EdU pulsing would increase the percentage of TopBP1 foci colocalizing with EdU. A longer pulse did increase the fraction of TopBP1 colocalizing with EdU; however, it also elevated the fraction of EdU foci without TopBP1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502107/DC1" id="supp4">Fig. S5</ext-link>).</p><p>Several recent publications have reported that Holliday junction resolution/dissolution is subject to a temporal control with the BLM-dependent dissolution pathway acting in S/G2, whereas resolution by SLX4/MUS81 is favored in G2/M and GEN1-mediated resolution acts later in mitosis (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Matos et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gallo-Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Szakal and Branzei, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wyatt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Brandao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gritenaite et al., 2014</xref>). Our observations of TopBP1 and SLX4 colocalization throughout mitosis together with the finding that SLX4 focus formation in mitosis is dependent on TopBP1, uncovers TopBP1 as a potential spatio-temporal regulator of Holliday junction resolvase activity.</p><p>The TopBP1-dependent formation of SLX4 foci in mitosis reported here also offers new insight to our understanding of the involvement of TopBP1 and its yeast homologue Dpb11 in suppression of chromatin bridges in anaphase (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Germann et al., 2014</xref>). In both yeast and vertebrate cells, depletion of Dpb11/TopBP1 greatly induces the formation of chromatin bridges, and detailed analyses in yeast revealed that chromatin bridge formation largely depends on homologous recombination. The TopBP1-dependent formation of SLX4 foci in mitosis suggests that TopBP1 suppresses chromatin bridges by promoting resolution of homologous recombination intermediates before anaphase.</p><p>Surprisingly, we find that both TopBP1 foci in mitosis as well as 53BP1 NBs in G1 are induced by treatment with the topoisomerase II inhibitor ICRF-193. This suggests that 53BP1 NBs in G1 do not just derive from under-replicated regions. Rather, perturbations in chromatin condensation may also cause DNA damage (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Samejima et al., 2012</xref>). However, the interpretation of the ICRF-193&#x02013;induced effects is complicated by the fact that ICRF-193 is not merely blocking the catalytic cycle of topoisomerase II, but also traps topoisomerase II clamped onto DNA (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Roca et al., 1994</xref>), which actively poisons cells (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Oestergaard et al., 2004</xref>) and perturbs chromatin structure (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Germe and Hyrien, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we show that in mitosis TopBP1 functions to avoid transmission of DNA damage to daughter cells by promoting proper localization of the SLX4 resolvase and by facilitating DNA synthesis. This notion is supported by the observation that depletion of TopBP1 at mitosis results in a dramatic increase in 53BP1 NBs in the following G1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s12"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All DT40 cell lines, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502107/DC1" id="supp5">Tables S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502107/DC1" id="supp6">S2</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502107/DC1" id="supp7">S3</ext-link>, respectively.
