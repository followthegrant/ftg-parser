It is possible to get even with no risk factors; although, if there are more factors, the higher it is the probability of illness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>It was carried out an analytic study of cases and controls to identify risk factors associated with Recurrent Upper Respiratory Infections (RURI) in children under 5 years old from Habana Vieja municipality between January and June of the 2008, 40 children with RURI were studied selected by convenience sampling and 40 controls. Surveys were relatives. The group of cases was compared with the group control and then it was analyzed if the exhibition factor was associated to the RURI by means of the test of square chi, for that which was considered as significant a <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 in which case the test of odds ratio was applied (OR) to determine if really the factor or characteristic is or not of risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The most common was RURI was Adenoiditis with 18 cases (45%). All the cases had personal and family history of allergy, compared with 37.5% and 62,5% respectively in controls; (OR = 25.4 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001 and OR = 16,3 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). The adequate breastfeeding was more frequent in controls (OR = 2.5 <italic>P</italic> = 0.048). 70% of the cases were exposed to the smoke of the tobacco, and controls only 25% (OR = 8.2). 92.5% of the homes of the cases and 70% of the controls had animals, especially dogs. The cold (92.5%), temperature changes (80%) and humidity (80%) were considered environmental risk factors in this study (OR = 14.5 <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001; OR = 16.5 <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, OR = 13.2 <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Risk factors affecting the RURI are: personal and family history of allergy, inadequate breastfeeding, exposure to the smoke of tobacco and the presence of domestic animals, cold, changing weather and humidity.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
