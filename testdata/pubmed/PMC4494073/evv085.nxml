For long-lived organisms, acclimation likely generates a faster response but is only effective if the rates and limits of acclimation match the dynamics of local environmental variation. In coral reef habitats, heat stress from extreme ocean warming can occur over several weeks, resulting in symbiont expulsion and widespread coral death. However, transcriptome regulation during short-term acclimation is not well understood. We examined acclimation during a 11-day experiment in the coral <italic>Acropora nana.</italic> We acclimated colonies to three regimes: ambient temperature (29 &#x000b0;C), increased stable temperature (31 &#x000b0;C), and variable temperature (29&#x02013;33 &#x000b0;C), mimicking local heat stress conditions. Within 7&#x02013;11 days, individuals acclimated to increased temperatures had higher tolerance to acute heat stress. Despite physiological changes, no gene expression changes occurred during acclimation before acute heat stress. However, we found strikingly different transcriptional responses to heat stress between acclimation treatments across 893 contigs. Across these contigs, corals acclimated to higher temperatures (31 &#x000b0;C or 29&#x02013;33 &#x000b0;C) exhibited a muted stress response&#x02014;the magnitude of expression change before and after heat stress was less than in 29 &#x000b0;C acclimated corals. Our results show that corals have a rapid phase of acclimation that substantially increases their heat resilience within 7 days and that alters their transcriptional response to heat stress. This is in addition to a previously observed longer term response, distinguishable by its shift in baseline expression, under nonstressful conditions. Such rapid acclimation may provide some protection for this species of coral against slow onset of warming ocean temperatures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acclimation</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>thermal tolerance</kwd><kwd>coral</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anthropogenic climate change has led to unprecedented shifts in environmental temperature across many ecosystems. One glimmer of hope has come from studies showing that higher resilience to increased temperatures can sometimes be accomplished on the population level through evolutionary adaptation or on the individual level through acclimation (<xref rid="evv085-B38" ref-type="bibr">Somero 2010</xref>). Acclimation in particular has been studied in the context of rapid climate shifts because it operates within the lifespan of individual organisms, not across generations as in the case of Darwinian adaptation. Yet acclimation itself is under evolutionary pressures, and limits of acclimation are often based on the evolutionary history of the species and population (<xref rid="evv085-B25" ref-type="bibr">Meester 1996</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B41" ref-type="bibr">Stillman and Somero 2000</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B11" ref-type="bibr">Calosi et al. 2010</xref>). The role for evolutionary history in acclimation response is consistent with the range of acclimation abilities we see in nature; although the ability to acclimate seems to span every kingdom of life, variation exists both between and within species (<xref rid="evv085-B13" ref-type="bibr">Charmantier et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B33" ref-type="bibr">Reed and Waples 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B38" ref-type="bibr">Somero 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B43" ref-type="bibr">Tepolt and Somero 2014</xref>).</p><p>The value of acclimatory shifts to mitigate climate change impacts, however, needs careful study to not overestimate the potential impact. Specifically, understanding the rate of acclimation relative to the rate of environmental change is crucial. Yet fine scale studies of the acclimation process over short periods of time remain rare. As a result, the link between the nearly ubiquitous ability to acclimate and future climate fitness is incomplete. Acclimation capacity varies greatly among species in ways that may determine susceptibility to future climate change (<xref rid="evv085-B38" ref-type="bibr">Somero 2010</xref>, <xref rid="evv085-B39" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). For example, tropical <italic>Petrolisthes</italic> crabs have less acclimatory capacity than their more temperate congeners, making the warm-adapted species paradoxically more susceptible to increases in temperature (<xref rid="evv085-B41" ref-type="bibr">Stillman and Somero 2000</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B40" ref-type="bibr">Stillman 2003</xref>). This flexibility of response to environmental stimuli can take a number of forms, including use of stable protein isoforms, increased production of chaperone proteins, and increased membrane rigidity (<xref rid="evv085-B19" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann and Todgham 2010</xref>). Differences in acclimation ability are reflected in gene expression responses, where species capable of acclimation show transcriptional plasticity not present in nonacclimating species (<xref rid="evv085-B39" ref-type="bibr">Somero 2012</xref>).</p><p>Different mechanisms underscore different patterns of rate and reversibility of acclimation. In plants, a form of acclimation called &#x0201c;stress memory,&#x0201d; in which a previously stressed individual is less susceptible to future stress, can be categorized into two broad mechanistic groups (<xref rid="evv085-B10" ref-type="bibr">Bruce et al. 2007</xref>). The first group involves shifting concentrations of proteins or transcription factors that remain at altered levels after an initial stress&#x02014;a baseline change in expression. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, for example, <italic>CBF</italic> transcription factors induced at low nonfreezing temperatures control freezing tolerance (<xref rid="evv085-B44" ref-type="bibr">Thomashow et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B15" ref-type="bibr">Cook et al. 2004</xref>). The second category consists of changes in chromatin structure such as methylation, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling&#x02014;processes which might alter the transcriptional availability of a region. For example, histone acetylation in submerged rice plants leads to the upregulation of well-known stress responsive genes (<xref rid="evv085-B46" ref-type="bibr">Tsuji 2006</xref>). The variance in cellular mechanisms likely contributes to the variance in rates of induction and reversal of acclimation observed in natural systems (<xref rid="evv085-B30" ref-type="bibr">Palumbi 1984</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B17" ref-type="bibr">Donelson et al. 2011</xref>). Acclimation resulting from chromatin modification, for example, can even be passed on to future generations (<xref rid="evv085-B9" ref-type="bibr">Boyko et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B17" ref-type="bibr">Donelson et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Sessile organisms like plants require especially well-tuned systems for dealing with environmental change. In marine environments, reef-building corals are both sessile and exceptionally long lived, so they will likely experience very different temperatures as climate change proceeds. As foundation species, reef-building corals are essential components of tropical marine ecosystems but live within 1&#x02013;2 &#x000b0;C of their upper temperature limit (<xref rid="evv085-B14" ref-type="bibr">Coles et al. 1976</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B20" ref-type="bibr">Jokiel 2004</xref>). Climate change has been implicated in the increasing number and severity of coral bleaching events in recent decades. Because ocean temperatures are both steadily increasing and experiencing more temperature anomalies, corals must respond to changes in their thermal environment on both very short and very long time scales.</p><p>Both laboratory-based and observational studies lend support for acclimation as an effective mechanism for increasing thermal tolerance in corals. In natural settings, corals subjected to increased temperatures during low tides exhibit higher thermal tolerance than conspecifics in more stable thermal environments (<xref rid="evv085-B12" ref-type="bibr">Castillo and Helmuth 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B28" ref-type="bibr">Oliver and Palumbi 2011</xref>). Controlled acclimation experiments show that individuals subjected to slightly increased temperatures bleach less when exposed to a severe heat stress (<xref rid="evv085-B26" ref-type="bibr">Middlebrook et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bellantuono, Hoegh-Guldberg, et al. 2012</xref>). Although these studies suggest that acclimation does occur in corals, we know little about the mechanism. Only one study has investigated rapid acclimation in corals at a transcriptional level (<xref rid="evv085-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bellantuono, Granados-Cifuentes, et al. 2012</xref>). This study examined expression during a chronic stress in individuals acclimated at different temperatures, finding little change in transcription. Despite a substantial shift in heat tolerance, the coral <italic>Acropora millepora</italic> showed only nine genes that were differentially expressed between acclimation treatments. Acclimatization during a reciprocal transplant in <italic>Acropora hyacinthus</italic>, however, did result in a shift in baseline expression; 74 genes were differentially expressed after one year in a new environment (<xref rid="evv085-B31" ref-type="bibr">Palumbi et al. 2014</xref>).</p><p>We conducted a temporal characterization of acclimation in the reef-building coral <italic>Acropora nana.</italic> Recent studies show that corals acclimated to field conditions can increase their thermal tolerance, but do these mechanisms effectively protect corals during rapid bleaching events? Our approach differs from previous laboratory experiments by using a severe, acute heat stress to assay thermal tolerance and transcriptional response. We report that shifts in physiological condition, heat tolerance, symbiont levels, and transcriptome response of the coral <italic>A. nana</italic> occur within 7 days of acclimation, producing a striking increase in heat tolerance. We uncover widespread gene expression shifts associated with acclimation after an acute heat stress. Unexpectedly, physiological acclimation is associated with reduced transcriptome response after heat stress, but no baseline changes in unstressed samples as were found in previous studies. Combining our results with previous studies, we suggest a multistage process for acclimation that can produce a rapid response in the acute heat stress mechanism and a slower response that alters background gene expression and physiological function. Both may slow the impact of ocean warming on corals for a short period of time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Acclimation</title><p>For acclimation, we used six 81-l flow-through tanks, two replicate tanks for each of three acclimation temperature regimes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv085/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

Temperature in each tank was controlled by pumping water from the tank through coils in hot and cold water baths, so that no water was exchanged between tanks. For a control, tanks were held at 29 &#x000b0;C, approximately ambient temperature on the reef at this location (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv085/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

The second treatment, the &#x0201c;stable&#x0201d; treatment, was held at an increased temperature of 31 &#x000b0;C. The final acclimation treatment, the &#x0201c;variable&#x0201d; treatment, fluctuated throughout the course of the day, mimicking tidal fluctuations and ranging from 29 to 33 &#x000b0;C. We used HOBO pendant temperature data loggers (Onset) to record the temperature of each tank every minute for the duration of the experiment. All tanks were covered in 75% shade cloth to avoid light stress.</p><p>We collected 18 small colonies (&#x0223c;15 cm in diameter) of the species <italic>A. nana</italic> from the reef crest on Ofu Island, American Samoa. We evenly distributed the colonies among the six acclimation tanks, resulting in three colonies per tank&#x02014;six per acclimation treatment. These colonies were assayed for thermal tolerance using an acute heat stress assay (described below) after 7 and 11 days of acclimation. Because of a series of unexpected power outages affecting heat stress tanks, we were unable to assay these colonies during earlier time points. We, therefore, collected a second batch of 18 colonies 1 week later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv085-F1">fig. 1</xref>), which we placed in the acclimation tanks and assayed for thermal tolerance after 0 and 2 days of acclimation. In total, this provided us with six heat-stressed and six nonstressed samples for each of three acclimation treatments (29 &#x000b0;C, 31 &#x000b0;C, and 29&#x02013;33 &#x000b0;C) at each of four acclimation durations (days 0, 2, 7, and 11)&#x02014;a total of 144 samples.

One branch was exposed to an acute heat stress&#x02014;a temperature ramp from 29 to 34 &#x000b0;C over the course of 3 h, followed by 5 h incubated at 34 &#x000b0;C, then a return to 29 &#x000b0;C and incubation at that temperature overnight. The second branch was used as a control&#x02014;held stable at 29 &#x000b0;C for the duration of the stress experiment. Each heat ramp started at 9:00 AM. No corals died during the acute heat stress, but they experienced varying degrees of bleaching. Samples were collected and preserved at 6:00 AM the following morning. At this time, a fragment from the base of each branch was placed in an RNA stabilizing solution for transcriptomic analysis and the remainder of the branch was preserved in 95% ethanol for chlorophyll a analysis, a proxy for bleaching.</p></sec><sec><title>Chlorophyll a Analysis to Measure Bleaching Response</title><p>Fragments of all nonstressed and stressed branches were preserved and transported in 3 ml 95% ethanol and kept in the dark until analyzed. We measured chlorophyll a concentration by measuring absorbance at four wavelengths (632, 649, 655, and 696) with a spectrophotometer (<xref rid="evv085-B34" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie 2008</xref>). The surface area of each branch was measured by dipping the branch in melted wax twice and weighing the branches after each dip (<xref rid="evv085-B42" ref-type="bibr">Stimson and Kinzie 1991</xref>). The difference between the two weights is proportional to the surface area. Absolute surface area was determined by comparing these values to a set of standards of known surface area analyzed simultaneously with the branches. Surface areas for each branch were used to normalize chlorophyll a concentrations. We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to analyze impacts of both acclimation treatment and duration on chlorophyll a concentrations in nonstressed and stressed samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptome Sequencing and Assembly</title><p>A fragment of each sample was preserved for transcriptomic analysis in an RNA stabilizing solution. These samples were stored at 4 &#x000b0;C for 24 h, then transferred to &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C for the remainder our time in the field, approximately 1&#x02013;2 weeks. Samples were transported to Stanford, where they were stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until extraction. We extracted total RNA from each sample using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and created cDNA libraries using the Illumina TruSeq mRNA Sample Prep kit. All 144 samples were barcoded using Illumina adapters and were randomized and pooled into 12 lanes sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. For de novo assembly, one lane was sequenced as 101-bp paired-end reads, while the remaining 11 lanes were sequenced as 50-bp single-end reads.</p><p>Quality filtering, assembly, and mapping of reads followed the pipeline in <xref rid="evv085-B16" ref-type="bibr">de Wit et al. (2012)</xref>. Low-quality (<italic>Q</italic> &#x0003c; 20) portions of reads, as well as short reads (&#x0003c;20 bp) and adapter sequences were trimmed using the fastx-toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html</ext-link>). Only paired-end samples were used for de novo assembly using CLC Genomics Workbench (mismatch cost = 1, insertion/deletion cost = 2, length fraction = 0.5, minimum contig length = 200). Noncoral contigs were removed from the assembly using a custom BLAST-based pipeline and the remaining contigs were annotated based on the top BLAST hit to the nr and Uniprot databases (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv085/-/DC1">supplementary materials</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv085/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online, for details on filtering and annotation of contigs). Forward reads from the paired-end lane were trimmed to 50 bp, so they could be used along side single-end reads for gene expression. Single-end and trimmed paired-end reads were mapped to the assembly using BWA (<xref rid="evv085-B22" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>). The number of reads that mapped to each contig with a minimum quality score (<italic>Q</italic> &#x0003e; 20) were counted using an in-house python script. Only contigs with a mean of greater than 5 reads across all samples and a standard deviation less than the mean read count were used in downstream analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene Expression Analysis</title><p>We analyzed gene expression separately for heat-stressed and nonstressed conditions. Raw counts were normalized using the DESeq package in R (<xref rid="evv085-B2" ref-type="bibr">Anders and Huber 2010</xref>). For a broad scale examination of variation, we performed a principle components analysis of all samples. For heat-stressed samples, this revealed nine obvious outliers (three from each acclimation treatment), which corresponded to a single experimental acute heat stress tank run on September 16, 2012, after 2 days of acclimation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv085/-/DC1">supplementary fig.

Because this is likely an experimental artifact, we removed these nine samples from downstream analysis. Because samples were evenly divided across heat stress tanks, removal of these samples did not result in loss of any treatment but a halving of sample size for each acclimation treatment at that time point.</p><p>To identify genes whose expression was associated with acclimation treatment, normalized counts were used in a permutational ANOVA for each contig, using acclimation treatment and day as factors. Because we are interested in genes with significant differences between acclimation treatments, we examined only contigs in which the acclimation term was significant (false discovery rate [FDR] corrected <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.01). For this set of genes, we used hierarchical clustering to find groups of co-expressed genes (Spearman correlation &#x0003e; 0.6). The variation in each cluster of co-expressed genes is represented by the centered first principal component of that cluster (<xref rid="evv085-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alter et al. 2000</xref>). For each cluster, we used ANOVA to test the effects of acclimation treatment and number of acclimation days on gene expression. We also tested for functional enrichment of clusters using GoEast (<xref rid="evv085-B47" ref-type="bibr">Zheng and Wang 2008</xref>) with FDR &#x0003c; 0.05 to identify overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) terms for contigs within each cluster.</p><p>In addition to analyzing gene expression clusters, we directly tested for differentially expressed contigs between stable (31 &#x000b0;C) and variable (29&#x02013;33 &#x000b0;C) acclimation treatments. For this analysis, we used only data from days 7 and 11, when acclimation-based differences were most likely to occur. We used the DESeq package to conduct a negative binomial test across all contigs with average coverage of greater than five reads and standard deviation less than the mean.</p><p>To examine the heat stress response of acclimation-regulated gene clusters, we grouped all samples and measured the change in expression between stressed and nonstressed samples. We used the DESeq package for normalization, then calculated the heat stress response, defined as log<sub>2</sub> of the mean difference between heat-stressed and nonstressed expression, for each gene in a co-expressed cluster. We then compared the distribution of heat stress response for a given cluster to a null distribution created from 1,000 randomly sampled groups of the same size as the cluster.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Shifts in Bleaching Response After Acute Heat Stress across Acclimation Treatments</title><p>Corals acclimated to 31 &#x000b0;C or variable (29&#x02013;33 &#x000b0;C) temperature regimes showed higher thermal tolerance, measured by the proportion of chlorophyll a retained after heat stress, than corals in the control acclimation treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv085-F2">fig. 2</xref><italic>a</italic>). Corals from all three acclimation temperatures show increased heat resistance between days 0 and 2. This is likely due to recovery from either transplant stress or some other nontemperature effect associated with moving colonies from the reef to the tanks. If we exclude day 0 and thus the artifact of transplantation, we observe a significant difference between acclimation treatments in the proportion of chlorophyll a retained in heat-stressed branches compared with nonstressed branches (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

Of 28,053 contigs, 22,338 (79.6%) yielded significant results (FDR = 0.05) in a negative binomial test for differential expression during heat stress. The difference in total read count is likely the result of a drastic change in expression across many genes, altering total transcription levels. Since normalization methods assume that most genes are not differentially expressed, a gene-by-gene analysis of heat stress expression is not reliable in this case. We can, however, compare the magnitude of change during heat stress across groups of genes. We, therefore, examine the response to acute heat stress of genes in the two clusters we identified as differentially expressed across acclimation treatments. These broad-scale comparisons show us that cluster 1 is upregulated after heat stress (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) compared with a random sample, while cluster 2 is downregulated after heat stress (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv085-F4">fig. 4</xref>).

In addition, we found as much acclimation in a variable temperature regime (29&#x02013;33 &#x000b0;C) as in a stable increased temperature (31 &#x000b0;C). Based on field observations, many studies have hypothesized that large magnitude fluctuations in temperature may result in higher thermal tolerance in corals (<xref rid="evv085-B12" ref-type="bibr">Castillo and Helmuth 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B28" ref-type="bibr">Oliver and Palumbi 2011</xref>). Acclimation to fluctuating temperatures has also been shown to alter gene expression in other organisms. For example, <xref rid="evv085-B32" ref-type="bibr">Podrabsky and Somero (2004)</xref> found that different classes of heat shock protein were upregulated during acclimation to fluctuating and constant temperatures in the killifish <italic>Austrofundulus limnaeus.</italic> However, we find no evidence for such differences within our data; no significant difference in either thermal tolerance or gene expression was observed between stable and variable acclimation treatments.</p><p>At a different site on Ofu Island, <xref rid="evv085-B31" ref-type="bibr">Palumbi et al.

Using the same metric, our acclimation treatments appear very different from one another: the stable acclimation treatment exceeded 31 &#x000b0;C 41% of the time, while the variable treatment only exceeded 31 &#x000b0;C 18% of the time. Yet no differences in either bleaching or gene expression profiles were observed between these two treatments. This suggests that perhaps thermal tolerance does not increase linearly with either the magnitude of temperature increase or an integrated temperature over time but may rather be a &#x0201c;switch&#x0201d; that occurs when the organism experiences a temperature threshold.</p></sec><sec><title>Stability of Gene Expression in Nonheat-Stressed Branches during Acclimation</title><p>Although we see a marked difference in thermal tolerance phenotype after acclimation to increased temperatures, we do not observe a corresponding change in baseline expression in nonstressed samples. Shifts in baseline gene expression during temperature acclimation have been observed in plants, for example, in the induction of genes that convey freezing tolerance after acclimation to decreased temperatures (<xref rid="evv085-B44" ref-type="bibr">Thomashow et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B15" ref-type="bibr">Cook et al. 2004</xref>). Long-term field acclimation experiments in a congener, <italic>A. hyacinthus</italic> have found changes in expression in a broad array of genes after acclimation to increased temperatures (<xref rid="evv085-B3" ref-type="bibr">Barshis et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B31" ref-type="bibr">Palumbi et al. 2014</xref>). Our data do not show this pattern; the ANOVA does not yield a single contig with acclimation-associated expression in nonstressed samples. The mechanism of acclimation in our experiment appears to be different than in previous studies, or the response may be incomplete, perhaps due to the short duration of acclimation.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms of Acclimation</title><p>The observation that recent thermal history alters thermal tolerance is consistent with decades of work on a broad range of organisms (<xref rid="evv085-B29" ref-type="bibr">Otto 1974</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B41" ref-type="bibr">Stillman and Somero 2000</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B10" ref-type="bibr">Bruce et al. 2007</xref>). In many cases, both stable and variable increased temperatures can increase heat tolerance, often through changes in gene expression, for example, through plasticity of heat shock proteins (<xref rid="evv085-B45" ref-type="bibr">Tomanek and Somero 1999</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B32" ref-type="bibr">Podrabsky and Somero 2004</xref>). Indeed, this type of stress memory has been documented in other species of corals (<xref rid="evv085-B26" ref-type="bibr">Middlebrook et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bellantuono, Hoegh-Guldberg, et al. 2012</xref>). <xref rid="evv085-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bellantuono, Granados-Cifuentes, et al.

In fact, in a number of cases contigs that were stress responsive after 29 &#x000b0;C acclimated conditions responded less to acute heat stress after acclimation to higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv085-F5">fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>The majority of acclimation-associated genes belong to a single cluster containing 709 contigs. Genes in this cluster decreased after heat stress but much less so after acclimation. This cluster is dominated by genes for ribosomal RNA processing and carbohydrate metabolism. A dampened response to acute heat in this case may reflect lower stress levels and higher metabolism in acclimated colonies. Previous studies have shown that rRNA synthesis rate can be altered in response to a change in intracellular energy status, such as during environmental stress (<xref rid="evv085-B27" ref-type="bibr">Murayama et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B8" ref-type="bibr">Boulon et al. 2010</xref>). Ribosomes are responsible for synthesizing new proteins. Perhaps, heat acclimated samples experience less stress-related protein damage and therefore have different energy requirements than samples acclimated under control conditions.</p><p>Within this same cluster is the only heat shock protein we find to be associated with acclimation, <italic>HSP75.</italic> As with other genes in this cluster, this contig decreases after heat stress but to a lesser magnitude in acclimated organisms. Other studies have found important roles for multiple heat shock proteins in acclimation of snails (<xref rid="evv085-B45" ref-type="bibr">Tomanek and Somero 1999</xref>), fish (<xref rid="evv085-B32" ref-type="bibr">Podrabsky and Somero 2004</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B18" ref-type="bibr">Fangue 2006</xref>), plants (<xref rid="evv085-B21" ref-type="bibr">Larkindale and Vierling 2007</xref>), and many other organisms including corals (<xref rid="evv085-B31" ref-type="bibr">Palumbi et al. 2014</xref>). Our data, however, find only a single contig with significant expression differences between acclimation treatments. It is possible that the induction of heat shock proteins occurs earlier during thermal stress and we did not see this signal because we sampled the following day. <xref rid="evv085-B35" ref-type="bibr">Seneca and Palumbi (2015)</xref> found that 19 heat shock contigs in <italic>A. hyacinthus</italic> increased 5 h after acute heat shock, but only three remained at high level after 20 h.</p><p>A second cluster of 71 contigs increases after acute heat stress and shows a dampened increase in expression when acute heat stress follows acclimation to high temperature. Because nearly 60% of these contigs had no annotation, we found no significant GO categories for this cluster. However, five contigs in this cluster have known functions in ubiquitination, or protein recycling, including a PHD finger protein, a ubiquitin protein ligase, two RING finger proteins, and a ubiquitin-like protein. Studies in several organisms, including yeast model systems, have shown that expression of ubiquitins can be related to thermal tolerance (<xref rid="evv085-B4" ref-type="bibr">Barshis et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B36" ref-type="bibr">Shahsavarani et al. 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional Dampening and Two Stages of Thermal Acclimation</title><p>Whether populations persist during anthropogenic climate change will depend partly on the relative rates of increase of thermal tolerance and of environmental temperatures. Our results show that substantial physiological acclimation begins quickly, within 7&#x02013;11 days, and can increase thermal tolerance and alter gene expression patterns. This suggests that corals can track environmental temperatures better than previously believed. Such rapid change in heat sensitivity runs contrary to coral bleaching models based on fixed thermal tolerance that are currently used to predict coral bleaching and climate change response (<xref rid="evv085-B23" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B24" ref-type="bibr">Logan et al. 2013</xref>). However, the limits to acclimation&#x02019;s ability to increase thermal tolerance remain unknown and should be examined in future studies.</p><p>Thermal tolerance in nature has two components: an adaptive component determined by fixed differences at the individual level such as genotype, development, or epigenetics and an acclimatory component determined by physiological responses to the local environment. Previously, we showed that thermal tolerance in a different coral, <italic>A. hyacinthus</italic> included both acclimation and fixed effects (<xref rid="evv085-B31" ref-type="bibr">Palumbi et al. 2014</xref>). We identified over 100 genetic variants that were associated with thermal tolerance in populations of this species living in warm back reef pools (<xref rid="evv085-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bay and Palumbi 2014</xref>) but also that transplanting colonies between pools changed colony response to acute heat stress (<xref rid="evv085-B31" ref-type="bibr">Palumbi et al. 2014</xref>).</p><p>The data we present here show very rapid physiological change but also suggest that the regulatory mechanism of temperature acclimation may have several phases. Our study focuses on rapid responses and finds few baseline changes in gene expression in the first week. In contrast, studies of longer term acclimation for corals in this environment show substantial baseline change in gene expression (<xref rid="evv085-B3" ref-type="bibr">Barshis et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evv085-B31" ref-type="bibr">Palumbi et al. 2014</xref>). Despite these differences, both of these acclimatory mechanisms result in a strikingly similar dampened transcriptional response to heat stress in individuals that have adjusted to higher temperatures (f<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv085-F5">ig. 5<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). In the case of short term acclimation, transcriptional dampening results from a lower reaction of these genes to acute stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv085-F5">fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>). In the case of longer term acclimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evv085-F5">fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>), transcriptional dampening occurs because these genes are already upregulated in acclimated colonies, even before acute heat stress. We termed this latter response &#x0201c;frontloading&#x0201d; (<xref rid="evv085-B3" ref-type="bibr">Barshis et al. 2013</xref>) and hypothesized that it represented a baseline gene expression strategy for long-term heat acclimation. Our current experiments with <italic>A<italic>.</italic> nana</italic> suggest that frontloading occurs after a longer acclimation period than 11 days, whereas transcriptional damping occurs quickly.</p><p>The ultimate response of populations to climate change will depend on the relative roles of adaptation and acclimation. Because adaptation takes much longer, it is unlikely that adaptation alone will keep pace with climate change. Acclimation can shift individual colony responses over a time scale as short as 1 week (see also <xref rid="evv085-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bellantuono, Hoegh-Guldberg, et al. 2012</xref>), perhaps acting to provide rapid seasonal adjustments in a coral&#x02019;s heat tolerance or even respond to short-term bleaching temperatures that accompany el Ni&#x000f1;o events. Our results and those of <xref rid="evv085-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bellantuono, Granados-Cifuentes, et al. (2012)</xref> suggest that this rapid acclimation involves transcriptional dampening without baseline gene expression changes.</p><p>However, acclimation over longer periods includes a set of baseline expression changes that may more significantly restructure a coral&#x02019;s daily metabolism and growth. Perhaps it is a sequential response that begins with changes in gene expression during heat stress, followed by changes in baseline expression, followed eventually by genetic adaptation, that may allow populations to persist in a changing environment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv085/-/DC1">Supplementary methods, table S1</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evv085/-/DC1">figures S1&#x02013;S5</ext-link> are available at <italic>Genome Biology and Evolution</italic> online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/">http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors sincerely thank Carlo Caruso, the National Park of American Samoa, and Megan Morikawa for their help with experimental setup.
