BC is also considered as the fourth main reason of cancer-associated deaths in males worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Though various therapeutic methods have been utilized in medical treatment, BC patients in advanced stage still confront with poor prognosis outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Multifocality, high rates of relapse and lack of sensitive target in early period diagnosis are the major reasons of the poor prognosis of BC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, it is paramount to find sensitive therapeutic target of BC.</p><p id="Par23">Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) refer to those genes with exceeding 200 nucleotides (nt) in length but without the capacity to encode proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. LncRNAs have been reported to be abnormally expressed in various cancers, and exerts an irreplaceable function in the carcinogenesis and progression of malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. LncRNAs are associated with different pathological cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion as well as migration. For example, lncRNA UCA1 facilitates cell growth and migration, yet refrains cell apoptosis in gastric cancer by up-regulating PDL1 through sponging miR-26a/b, miR-193a and miR-214 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. LncRNA SNHG1 regulates colorectal cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and impacts cell activity via binding with miR-497/miR-195-5p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Hence, targeting lncRNA could hopefully be a theoretical treatment method in cancers.</p><p id="Par24">The prevalent ceRNA hypothesis reveals that lncRNA could influence the function of target gene via competitively binding to miRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. KCNQ1OT1 is a novel identified lncRNA. Its role in some diseases including cancers has been explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For example, in colorectal cancer, KCNQ1OT1 serves as ceRNA to facilitate cell migration and EMT process via regulating the expression of miR-217/ZEB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. While its function in BC still unclear. This study aims to explore whether KCNQ1OT1 functions as ceRNA mechanically in BC tumorigenesis and evolvement, so as to provide a possible target for BC prognosis and treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Human tissue samples</title><p id="Par25">From June 2012 to January 2018, 70 bladder cancer specimens and corresponding normal tissues were gathered from Affiliated Hospital of Beihua University.

Firstly, sh-NC, sh-KCNQ1OT1#1 and sh-KCNQ1OT1#2 plasmids were transfected into T24 and HT-1197 to ensure the transfection efficiency. And qRT-PCR detected that sh-KCNQ1OT1#1 exhibiting a better knockdown effect (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Therefore, it was chosen for all subsequent assays in need for KCNQ1OT1 inhibition plasmid. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were carried out to detect cell proliferation ability. We observed that knockdown of KCNQ1OT1 significantly crippled BC cell viability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). The decreased number of colonies illustrated that sh-KCNQ1OT1 inhibited cell proliferation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e).

After calculating TUNEL positive rate, we found significantly increased TUNEL positive cells caused by KCNQ1OT1 depletion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). Also, flow cytometry result validated this conclusion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g). Then wound healing and transwell assays were applied to evaluate the effects brought by sh-KCNQ1OT1 on cell migration and invasion, respectively. We observed that knockdown of KCNQ1OT1 shrank wound closure region and decreased migrated cells dramatically (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>h, i). Moreover, western blot measured relevant protein expressions.

This further proved that KCNQ1OT1 knockdown promoted cell apoptosis, while curbing cell migration. In addition, KCNQ1OT1 deficiency resulted in rising expression of E-cadherin, and declining expression of N-cadherin, which was illustrated by western blot and immunofluorescence staining assays (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1B-C).

Moreover, significant down-regulated expression of miR-145-5p in BC tissue and cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, c). We also noticed that the expression of miR-145-5p was negatively correlated with that of KCNQ1OT1 from Pearson correlation analysis, which proved the sponge role of KCNQ1OT1 on miR-145-5p (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). Next, subcellular fractionation and FISH assays were employed to determine the location of KCNQ1OT1. Both results manifested that it was principally located in cytoplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). Then, we obtained potential binding sites between miR-145-5p and KCNQ1OT1 from Starbase (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). Dual luciferase reports verified the potential combination between KCNQ1OT1 and miR-145-5p. MiR-145-5p mimics could remarkably attenuate the luciferase activity of KCNQ1OT1 WT compared with negative control groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g). RNA pull down assay further confirmed this conclusion, as enriched expression of KCNQ1OT1 was pulled down by biotin-miR-145-5p WT group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h). From above findings, we assumed that miR-145-5p could be a tumor suppressor in BC. It was also the upstream gene of KCNQ1OT1. To determine the joint effect on pathological activities, miR-145-5p inhibitor was co-transfected with sh-KCNQ1OT1 in BC cells. Besides, the knockdown efficiency of miR-145-5p inhibitor was ensured by qRT-PCR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>i). On one hand, after silencing miR-145-5p, cell viability was significantly increased compared with sh-KCNQ1OT1 group from CCK-8 assay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>j). This conclusion was further confirmed by colony formation assay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>k). MiR-145-5p inhibitor reversed the pro-apoptosis role of sh-KCNQ1OT1 in BC cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>l). Furthermore, miR-145-5p inhibitor offset the suppressing effects of sh-KCNQ1OT1 on BC cell migration and invasion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>m, n). Similarly, western blot assay was measured relevant protein expression. KCNQ1OT1 silencing could increase the level of cell-apoptosis-promoting proteins (Bax and cleaved caspase-3/8/9), but reduced that of cell-apoptosis-suppressing protein (Bcl-2) and cell-migration-promoting proteins (MMP2, MMP7). However, miR-145-5p inhibitor reversed this protein-level-promoting (Bax and cleaved caspase-3/8/9) inhibiting (Bcl-2, MMP2 and MMP7) role of sh-KCNQ1OT1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>o). In a word, KCNQ1OT1 realizes its regulatory effects on BC progression via sponging miR-145-5p.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>KCNQ1OT1 serves as miR-145-5p sponge in BC. <bold>a</bold> QRT-PCR analysis detected the expression of miRNAs after knockdown of KCNQ1OT1. <bold>b</bold> QRT-PCR assay assessed miR-145-5p expression in BC tissues and normal tissues. <bold>c</bold> QRT-PCR assay examined the expression of miR-145-5p in cell lines. <bold>d</bold> Pearson correlation was conducted to explore the correlation between miR-145-5p and KCNQ1OT1 in BC tissues. <bold>e</bold> Subcellular fractionation and FISH assays determined the distribution of KCNQ1OT1 in nucleus and cytoplasm.

Hence we screened out twelve qualified messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from Starbase (chose strict stringency&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;3 on clip data, high stringency on degradome data, 2 cancer types in Pan-cancer and one program for program number). Then we detected which mRNA expression level was influenced most dramatically by miR-145-5p mimics. And the satisfactory overexpression efficiency of miR-145-5p mimics was ensured by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, qRT-PCR measured that over-expression of miR-145-5p caused significant depletion of PCBP2 only, which suggested that PCBP2 could be the most potential target gene (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). To verify this, qRT-PCR detected the relative expression of PCBP2 in BC tissue and cell lines later, and PCBP2 exhibited obviously high expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, c). QRT-PCR analysis also showed that knockdown of KCNQ1OT1 can down-regulate the expression of PCBP2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Given this phenomenon, we anticipated that KCNQ1OT1 could regulate the expression of PCBP2 via miR-145-5p. To prove this assumption, we examined whether a chemical interaction existed between miR-145-5p and PCBP2. Hence, the Starbase-predicted binding sites between them were verified by dual luciferase assays result (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, f). We observed miR-145-5p mimics dramatically impaired the luciferase activity of PCBP2 3&#x02032;-UTR WT compared with negative control groups. After further verification of RIP assay, we obtained the conclusion that PCBP2 physically bound with miR-145-5p (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g). Therefore, we proved that KCNQ1OT1 overexpression could upregulate PCBP2 expression via sequestering miR-145-5p in BC.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>MiR-145-5p targets PCBP2 in BC. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> QRT-PCR analysis tested the expression of miR-145-5p and twelve mRNA in miR-145-5p mimics-transfected cells. <bold>b</bold> QRT-PCR assessed PCBP2 expression in BC tissues and matched control groups. <bold>c</bold> QRT-PCR assay detected PCBP2 expression in BC cell lines and SV-HUC-1 cell. <bold>d</bold> QRT-PCR detected PCBP2 expression after knockdown of KCNQ1OT1. <bold>e</bold> There displayed Starbase-predicted binding sites between PCBP2 and miR-145-5p. <bold>f</bold>, <bold>g</bold> Dual luciferase report and RIP assays validated the interactions among KCNQ1OT1, miR-145-5p and PCBP2 was in BC. <bold>h</bold> The transfection efficiency of sh-PCBP2 was guaranteed by qRT-PCR. <bold>i</bold>, <bold>j</bold> CCK-8 and colony formation assays assessed cell proliferation between sh-NC and sh-PCBP2 groups. <bold>k</bold> TUNEL examined cell apoptosis between sh-NC and sh-PCBP2 groups. <bold>l</bold>, <bold>m</bold> Wound healing and transwell assays measured cell migration and invasion between sh-NC and sh-PCBP2 groups. <bold>n</bold> Western blot observed protein level between sh-NC and sh-PCBP2 groups.

The transfection efficiency of pcDNA3.1/PCBP2 was guaranteed by qRT-PCR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). According to the results of CCK-8, up-regulation of PCBP2 reversed the suppression on cell viability of sh-KCNQ1OT1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). In addition, TUNEL assay examined that pcDNA3.1/PCBP2 co-transfected with sh-KCNQ1OT1 could greatly reduce the number of apoptotic cells compared with group treated with sh-KCNQ1OT1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Besides, wound healing and transwell assays measured cell migration and invasion, separately.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par50">Long non-coding (lncRNAs) have been widely reported to be related to various human malignancies. Besides, lncRNAs can exert its effects on pathological process through regulating gene transcription and downstream gene expression level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recently, KCNQ1OT1, as a novel lncRNA, was found to be significantly up-regulated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cell lines and positively correlated with poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, KCNQ1OT1 was aberrantly highly expressed in breast cancer (BRCA) tissues and cell lines, and it could deteriorate tumor progression via regulating miR-145/CCNE2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Based on these researches, we supposed that KCNQ1OT1 might serve as an oncogene in tumors. In present study, we confirmed that KCNQ1OT1 exhibited abnormally high expression in BC tissues and cell lines, besides, BC patients with advanced stage (III/IV) enjoyed higher level of KCNQ1OT1 than those with early stage (I/II), which was closely associated with tumor cell biological function and pathological processes. Further, knockdown of KCNQ1OT1 dampened cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT, while expedited cell apoptosis. Silencing KCNQ1OT1 also repressed xenografts growth in vivo. All these findings indicated that KCNQ1OT1 is an oncogene in BC progression.</p><p id="Par51">To date, accumulating studies have found that lncRNA could act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of microRNA (miRNA) and restore the miRNA downstream target gene function to a large extent. For instance, lncRNA WDFY3-AS2 can regulate the expression of RORA via sponging miR-18a in ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Also, in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), lncRNA DCRF can up-regulate PCDH17 expression through sponging miR-551b-5p, leading to increased cardiomyocyte autophagy in DCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Likewise, some lncRNAs involved in the tumorigenesis of BC have been reported as well. For example, lncRNA OXCT1-AS1 could bind with miR-455-5p and decrease the combination of miR-455-5p with JAK1, thus increasing expression of JAK1 in BC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. MiR-145-5p, a target of KCNQ1OT1, was found to be significantly down-regulated and was a tumor suppressor in some tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this study, we also noticed a remarkable down-regulation of miR-145-5p in BC tissues and cell lines. We further proved that KCNQ1OT1 mainly located in cytoplasm was an effective sponge of miR-145-5p. Moreover, the interactions between KCNQ1OT1 and miR-145-5p via luciferase activity report and RNA pull down assays. Additionally, miR-145-5p suppression counteracted the inhibiting influence of KCNQ1OT1 knockdown in BC cell proliferation, migration and invasion.</p><p id="Par52">Further, we selected PCBP2 as candidate target gene of miR-145-5p as it exhibited dramatically the lowest expression among the twelve predicted combinable genes after up-regulation of miR-145-5p. PCBP2 was reported to play a tumor facilitator role in several cancers. For example, PCBP2 expression was up-regulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and was correlated with advanced PDAC stages as well as poor diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In present study, we observed that the expression of PCBP2 was also up-regulated in BC tissues and cell lines. PCBP2 depletion inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, but stimulated cell apoptosis in BC. In addition, overexpression of PCBP2 reversed the tumor-suppressing function caused by sh-KCNQ1OT in BC. More specifically, KCNQ1OT1 overexpression can aggravate cell proliferation, migration and invasion yet inhibit cell apoptosis via up-regulating PCBP2 expression as miR-145-5p sponge in BC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par53">Our study suggests the KCNQ1OT1/miR-145-5p/PCBP2 axis existing in BC for the very first time.
