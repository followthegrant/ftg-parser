Phenytoin and sodium valproate continue to be the major antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) being used in India.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The adverse effects of long-term AEDs on bone and mineral metabolism was initially reported by Kruse in 1968, who observed radiological evidence of rickets and low serum calcium levels in 15% of a German pediatric outpatient population with epilepsy.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It has also been observed that these changes were seen as early as within 60 days of starting therapy.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>These findings of derangements in calcium and phosphate metabolism in patients with anticonvulsant therapy have been reported in epileptic populations throughout the world with prevalence rates ranging from 3 to 30%.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] AEDs like phenytoin, carbamazepine, and sodium valproate induce hepatic oxidase activity through microsomal enzymes (p 450) in the liver.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This in turn increases the metabolism of vitamin D and thus can lead to hypocalcemia, hypopophosphatemia, low vitamin D, and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The fracture risk in these patients is heightened much more by unsteadiness in gait, fall, and limited mobility. Biochemical changes described earlier are frequently seen in 30-40% of patients, in majority of these subjects the changes are either mild or subclinical in nature. The effect of AEDs on bone can also be modified by a number of factors like exposure to sunlight and poor dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Fractures in these patients also place a considerable economic burden.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>However, there are no studies in this regard in the southern Indian population with regards to epilepsy.

Fifty-three healthy subjects, matched for age and body mass index (BMI) were recruited from the community health database of the institution, as controls. Subjects with concomitant hepatic or renal diseases, malabsorption, and on other medications like corticosteroids, which could potentially affect the vitamin D and calcium metabolism were excluded.</p><p>A detailed clinical history, type of seizure, pattern of medications like type and duration of AEDs, and a physical assessment was conducted in all subjects. The daily intake of calcium was estimated by using semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Daily exposure to sunlight was estimated based on the duration of exposure to sunlight, amount of clothing, and extent of body surface area exposed to sunlight as detailed in an earlier study.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Physical assessment included evaluation for any specific features of osteomalacia, such as fractures or proximal muscle weakness. Informed consent was obtained from the all subjects and the study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB number 6203 dated 17/04/2009).</p><p>An overnight fasting blood sample was obtained for estimation of serum calcium, phosphate, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and intact PTH. A radioimmunoassay (DiaSorin, Stillwater, Minnesota) was used for determination of vitamin D levels. The analytical sensitivity of this assay, when defined as the lowest quantity that differentiated from the zero standard (<italic>N</italic> = 20) has been shown to be 1.5 ng/mL. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 5.5% at a vitamin D level of 15.6 ng/mL and 9.3% at a vitamin D level of 52.5 ng/mL. Vitamin D deficiency has been defined by most experts as a vitamin D level of less than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and a level of 30 ng/mL or greater has been considered to indicate sufficient vitamin D and values between 20 and 30 ng/dL have been considered as indicative of vitamin D insufficiency. Intact PTH was measured by chemiluminescence method using Immulite analyzer 2000 (normal - 8-50 pg/mL). Other biochemical parameters were measured in a fully automated and computerized microanalyzer (Hitachi model 911; Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation for these analyses were 1-5%.</p><p>BMD was assessed by using the Hologic DXA machine (QDR 4500; Hologic Inc, Waltham, Massachusetts) at the lumbar spine (L1-L4) and the femoral neck. The reference population consisted of normal Caucasian subjects from the manufacturer's database. The reference population (manufacturer's database) was Caucasian in origin for defining Z-scores. A Z-score less than two standard deviations (SDs) below the mean of the reference population was described as a low BMD.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The precision was 2% at both measured sites (spine and neck of femur).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>In an earlier study, vitamin D status was estimated in a group of ambulatory patients receiving anticonvulsants therapy and the mean difference of vitamin D level was found to be 6.2 ng/mL when compared between cases and controls.

Subjects who were on antiepileptic medications had a trend towards a low calcium intake, sunlight exposure, serum phosphate, and femoral neck BMD. The number of subjects with vitamin D deficiency was the same between cases and controls.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Dietary calcium intake</title><p>DCI was lower than the recommended daily allowance in both the groups. There was a significantly lower intake of dietary calcium in patients on anticonvulsant therapy. Several other studies from various parts of India have documented a similar trend towards a low calcium intake in healthy subjects[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Harinarayan <italic>et al.</italic>, in a study conducted in a rural Indian population had found that the DCI was lower than the recommended daily allowance.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Moreover, calcium deficiency appears be worsened by dietary factors like high phytate content in the south Indian diet which also contribute to a reduction in calcium absorption.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In the setting of nutritional calcium deficiency, PTH levels are raised in an attempt to convert 25(OH)D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D to increase the calcium absorption. However, in patients with low 25(OH)D at baseline, the resultant secondary hyperparathyroidism only results in more bone resorption.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Low serum phosphate</title><p>The lower serum phosphate level observed in our subjects with epilepsy has also been demonstrated in other studies.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] However, there was no difference in the proportion of patients having hypophosphatemia between cases and controls.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that anywhere from 25 to 50% differently-abled children[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or children on antiepileptic medications[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] had hypophosphatemia.</p><p>Hypophosphatemia may be secondary to vitamin D deficiency and also due to the direct effect of antiepileptic drugs on renal tubules in those on long-term treatment.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, many subjects on chronic anticonvulsant therapy may not develop significant hypophosphatemia. This has been documented in earlier studies. Kruse <italic>et al.</italic>, noted a higher tubular transportation rate of phosphate despite secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on anticonvulsant therapy.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] They described a normal rise in urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) excretion without concomitant increase in the excretion of phosphate in the urine after the infusion of parathyroid extract in children on phenytoin and phenobarbitione treatment, resembling pseudohypoparathyroidism type II.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Vitamin D levels</title><p>Vitamin D deficiency is quite common in India subcontinent.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Several studies from different parts of India in various subgroup of population including health volunteers, pregnant women, school children, hospital staff, and even army personnel show very high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Our study showed low vitamin D in both cases and controls and the difference between these two groups was not significant. Arya <italic>et al.</italic>, studied healthy volunteers from north India. The mean 25(OH)D in these volunteers was 12.3 ng/mL. Only one-third was vitamin D sufficient with a cutoff &#x0003e; 15 ng/mL.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Other studies have subsequently shown that healthy individuals, pregnant women, doctors, and nurses have extremely low vitamin D levels as opposed to depigmented women who have high normal levels.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] There is a greater magnitude of normal vitamin D levels in those from rural compared to urban areas; however, the difference is relatively small.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The proposed reasons for high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Indian population include skin pigmentation, clothing pattern, a lower, duration of sunlight exposure, genetic factors, and vegetarian diet.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Enzyme inducing properties of AEDs like phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbitone would have further contributed to the preexisting problem. Rapid vitamin D catabolism has been defined as the principal mechanism responsible vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia in those patients.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The duration of sunlight exposure had a positive correlation with vitamin D only in cases. The lack of correlation in controls is probably due to many factors including reporting bias and skin pigmentation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Other studies have demonstrated significant correlation between sunlight exposure and vitamin D levels.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Our study has shown higher PTH level among subjects with AEDS which is probably due to a combination of many factors such as vitamin D deficiency and poor DCI. Elevated PTH levels could be detrimental to bone in epileptic patients as it can increase the rate of bone resorption. Sahota <italic>et al.</italic>, have described a blunted response of PTH in nearly two-thirds of vitamin D deficient individuals in whom secondary hyperparathyroidism was not seen. This may explain the lack of a significant correlation between vitamin D and PTH in the control group.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Bone mineral density</title><p>BMD was lower in patients on anticonvulsants and was significantly lower (<italic>P</italic> = 0.041) at the neck of femur.

A larger sample would have brought out the differences more clearly. In addition, dichotomy observed with regards to changes in BMD between spine and femoral neck could not be further evaluated by bone histomorphometry for ethical reasons as it is an invasive procedure warranting bone biopsy from different sites.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the present study, many of the patients (58.1%) on AEDs had low vitamin D levels. Simultaneously, these patients were found to have low DCI, inadequate exposure to sunlight and low BMD at the femur.
