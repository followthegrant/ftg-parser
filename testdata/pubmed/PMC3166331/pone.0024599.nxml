To investigate the role of the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) in erythropoiesis, we studied the protein's expression on mouse erythroid precursors <italic>in vivo</italic> and utilized an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of the erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL) to evaluate the effect of silencing PrP<sup>C</sup> through RNA interference.</p><p>The expression of PrP<sup>C</sup> and selected differentiation markers was analyzed by quantitative multicolor flow cytometry, western blot analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. The silencing of PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in MEL cells was achieved by expression of shRNAmir from an integrated retroviral vector genome. The initial upregulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in differentiating erythroid precursors was detected both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting PrP<sup>C</sup>'s importance to the early stages of differentiation. The upregulation was highest on early erythroblasts (16200&#x000b1;3700 PrP<sup>C</sup> / cell) and was followed by the gradual decrease of PrP<sup>C</sup> level with the precursor's maturation reaching 470&#x000b1;230 PrP<sup>C</sup> / cell on most mature CD71<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Ter119<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> small precursors. Interestingly, the downregulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> protein with maturation of MEL cells was not accompanied by the decrease of PrP mRNA. The stable expression of anti-Prnp shRNAmir in MEL cells led to the efficient (&#x0003e;80&#x00025;) silencing of PrP<sup>C</sup> levels. Cell growth, viability, hemoglobin production and the transcription of selected differentiation markers were not affected by the downregulation of PrP<sup>C</sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, the regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in differentiating MEL cells mimics the pattern detected on mouse erythroid precursors <italic>in vivo</italic>. Decrease of PrP<sup>C</sup> protein expression during MEL cell maturation is not regulated on transcriptional level. The efficient silencing of PrP<sup>C</sup> levels, despite not affecting MEL cell differentiation, enables created MEL lines to be used for studies of PrP<sup>C</sup> cellular function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) is expressed in cells of various origins. It is conserved through the whole vertebrae class, suggesting its importance in cellular physiology<xref rid="pone.0024599-Linden1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, its role in physiological processes remains enigmatic although PrP<sup>C</sup> plays a basic role in the pathogenesis of the fatal neurodegenerative disorders known as Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies. Observation of PrP<sup>C</sup> deficient mice (PrP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) did not reveal significant health problems. On the other hand, experiments in cell cultures suggested that PrP<sup>C</sup> is linked to such processes as the prevention of apoptosis, copper metabolism linked to oxidative stress, iron metabolism, signalization and differentiation<xref rid="pone.0024599-Roucou1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024599-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024599-Nicolas1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A connection between prion pathogenesis and erythropoiesis was suggested by the downregulation of the &#x003b1;-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) mRNA during prion disease<xref rid="pone.0024599-Miele1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. A later study indicated that the disease progression affected the transcription of several other murine erythroid genes, e.g., Kell, GPA, band 3 and ankyrin<xref rid="pone.0024599-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. A link between PrP<sup>C</sup> expression and erythropoiesis was also demonstrated in PrP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice after the experimental induction of hemolytic anemia. Upon treatment with phenylhydrazine, PrP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice produced fewer reticulocytes than did PrP<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice. This result was probably due to the reduced level of erythropoietin production and higher percentage of apoptotic erythroid precursors<xref rid="pone.0024599-Zivny1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Apparently, the expression of PrP<sup>C</sup> is generally important in hematopoiesis. PrP<sup>C</sup> is present on the surface of mouse long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and supports their self-renewal and engraftment during serial transplantation. Quantitatively, 40&#x00025; of mouse bone marrow (BM) cells express PrP<sup>C</sup>, and, from this population of cells, 80&#x00025; are erythroid cells<xref rid="pone.0024599-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> human bone marrow stem cells also express PrP<sup>C</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0024599-Dodelet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024599-Risitano1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and circulating human and mouse red blood cells have similarly low levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> on their cellular membranes<xref rid="pone.0024599-Holada1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024599-Panigaj1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A widely used model for the study of erythroid differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> is presented by murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. MEL cells are blocked at the proliferative proerythroblast stage, and, after the addition of polar substances, e.g., hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), they lose their proliferative capacity and enter cell-cycle arrest. This process is characterized by structural (decreased cell volume and nuclear condensation) and biochemical changes (activation of erythroid genes, hemoglobin accumulation), which resemble those exhibited by natural erythroid differentiation<xref rid="pone.0024599-Marks1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Gougoumas and colleagues demonstrated transcriptional activation at the mRNA level of the PrP gene in growth-arrested MEL cells<xref rid="pone.0024599-Gougoumas1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Our study extends their observations by demonstrating divergences in the regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> at the protein and mRNA levels during inducer-mediated erythroid differentiation and cell-growth arrest caused by confluency. In addition, we exploited MEL cell lines with stably downregulated levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> to study its importance in the differentiation of MEL cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup>expression on mouse bone marrow and spleen erythroid precursors</title><p>Erythroid precursors were gated according their Ter119 and CD71 signals and the forward scatter (FSC) signals to the proE, EryA, EryB and EryC subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024599-g001">Fig. 1 A</xref>).

The downregulation of erythroid genes during prion infection has established a link between the peripheral pathogenesis of prion diseases and erythropoiesis. However, it is not clear if the effect is caused by direct interaction of prion particles with erythroid cells or if it is triggered by some yet unknown humoral response to the infection. The expression of PrP<sup>C</sup> on circulating red blood cells (RBCs) of closely related nonhuman primates varies from several thousand per cell to zero<xref rid="pone.0024599-Holada2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, implying that its function on mature erythrocytes is not conserved. Griffiths et al. demonstrated the regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> expression during the differentiation of cultured human erythroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that it may play a role in the differentiation of erythroid precursors. PrP<sup>C</sup> was found mostly in the perinuclear region of proerythroblasts, and the amount of PrP<sup>C</sup> declined as erythroid cells matured<xref rid="pone.0024599-Griffiths1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Human and mouse RBCs express approximately 200 PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules per cell<xref rid="pone.0024599-Holada1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, suggesting a similar regulation of its expression in the erythroid lineage in both species. In this study, we demonstrated that the surface expression of PrP<sup>C</sup> on erythroid precursors in the mouse bone marrow and spleen follows a similar pattern as the cells mature. The protein's levels first increase with basophilic erythroblasts, expressing more than twice as much PrP<sup>C</sup> as proerythroblasts, and then declines significantly in late basophilic and polychromatic erythroblasts, with most mature small erythroid precursors expressing only around 500 PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules per cell. This pattern of expression is suggestive of PrP<sup>C</sup>'s involvement in the early stages of erythroid differentiation. The differentiation of MEL cells in culture is known to resemble the <italic>in vivo</italic> process, with similar maturation stages: proerythroblast-like, erythroblasts-like and, occasionally, reticulocyte-like<xref rid="pone.0024599-Griffiths1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024599-Hyman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The surface expression of PrP<sup>C</sup> on uninduced MEL cells in the exponential phase of growth was approximately six times higher than that observed on proerythroblasts in the mouse bone marrow or spleen. However, the induction of differentiation led to nearly doubling of the PrP<sup>C</sup> number on MEL cell membranes within 24 h, which resembled a similar increase of PrP<sup>C</sup> expression on basophilic erythroblasts <italic>in vivo</italic>. In agreement with previous observations <italic>in vivo</italic>, we found that this initial upregulation was followed by a gradual downregulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> surface levels along with the progression of MEL cells' differentiation. This decrease did not reach the degree observed in small CD71<sup>-</sup>Ter119<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> erythroid precursors <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is in line with the limited ability of differentiating MEL cells to reach this stage of maturation. The differentiation of MEL cells is composed of two separate events, growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Both processes are characterized by the activation of early (cell-cycle control) and late (morphological changes) genes<xref rid="pone.0024599-Hyman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The first period lasts approximately 12 hours, after which the first committed cells materialize. The majority of cells are terminally differentiated between 24 and 50 h<xref rid="pone.0024599-Fibach1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In agreement with previous studies by Gougomas et al.<xref rid="pone.0024599-Gougoumas1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, we found that the Prnp gene in MEL cells is transcriptionally activated both during inducer-mediated differentiation and in confluent cells undergoing cell-cycle arrest. In addition, we were able to demonstrate the regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> at the protein level by western blot. Interestingly and in accordance with the flow cytometry results, in differentiating cells, the expression of the protein was downregulated after an initial increase, even though the level of PrP mRNA continued to rise. This result suggests that MEL cells' differentiation leads to a translational regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> levels<xref rid="pone.0024599-Schroder1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> not seen in uninduced cells undergoing cell-cycle arrest. Alternatively, more differentiated cells could degrade PrP<sup>C</sup> at an increased rate, as has been proposed to explain the disparity between PrP protein and mRNA levels in different types of neuronal cells<xref rid="pone.0024599-Ford1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The downregulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> protein during the differentiation of highly responsive subclones of MEL cells was recently reported by Otsuka et al.<xref rid="pone.0024599-Otsuka1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>; however, their study did not detect an initial increase of PrP<sup>C</sup> expression, most likely due to the different status of cells at the point of induction. Stimulation of the glucocorticoid receptor by dexamethasone induces the proliferation and expansion of erythroid progenitors and delays the terminal differentiation of erythrocytes<xref rid="pone.0024599-Chute1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In our hands, dexamethasone did not prevent the HMBA-induced initial upregulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> in MEL cells, suggesting that it precedes the effect of dexamethasone, which is known to suppress the HMBA-mediated commitment to terminal cell division at a relatively late step in this process<xref rid="pone.0024599-Kaneda1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, dexamethasone prevented the increase of PrP<sup>C</sup> protein levels in confluent MEL cells after 120 h of culture, demonstrating that the activation of the glucocorticoid receptor can interfere with the transcriptional activation of the Prnp gene mediated by cell-cycle arrest. The mechanism of dexamethasone's action on the prevention PrP<sup>C</sup> protein upregulation in confluent MEL cells is unknown at present. Dexamethasone has been shown to induce cell-cycle arrest in number of various cell lines<xref rid="pone.0024599-Mattern1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, but not in MEL cells, in which it increases cell viability<xref rid="pone.0024599-Osborne1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, both in induced and uninduced culture. In summary, our results demonstrate that the regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> levels in differentiating MEL cells resembles, at least in part, its regulation in maturing mouse erythroid precursors <italic>in vivo</italic>. To learn more about the importance of PrP<sup>C</sup> in the process of MEL cells' differentiation, we created cell lines using RNAi to stably inhibit expression of the protein. RNAi administered by shRNA from a retrovector had previously been employed efficiently to inhibit PrP<sup>C</sup> expression <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0024599-Tilly1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024599-Pfeifer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The main objective for using RNAi to suppress PrP<sup>C</sup> was to study its therapeutic potential in preventing propagation of infectious prions. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first murine cell line of non-neuronal origin with stably silenced PrP<sup>C</sup> expression. Inhibition of the protein's expression at both the mRNA and protein levels was efficiently maintained during the differentiation of MEL cells, although it varied between 75 and 95&#x00025; in individual time points. Despite the silencing, the induction of differentiation led to a detectable increase of PrP<sup>C</sup> signal on blots after 24 h, suggesting that the regulation of the protein's expression in LP1- and LP2-transduced cell lines follows similar pattern as in unmodified MEL cells, although at a suppressed level. Growth curve and viability of LP1-, LP2- and control LN-transduced cell lines after the induction of differentiation was similar, although the LP2-transduced cell line exhibited a higher proliferation capacity. Since the LP1-transduced cell line did not differ from control LN-transduced cell line, we could not assign the LP2-transduced cell line's divergence solely to PrP<sup>C</sup> silencing. All cell lines observed here demonstrated similar dynamics and level of hemoglobinization and regulation of the transferrin receptor on their cell membranes. This finding suggested that silencing of PrP<sup>C</sup> in MEL cells does not lead to gross perturbation of iron homeostasis, although the involvement of PrP<sup>C</sup> in iron-cell uptake was described recently<xref rid="pone.0024599-Singh2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024599-Singh3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Similarly, the level of the protooncogene c-myb, expression of which is characteristic of the proliferative state and has been demonstrated to block MEL cells' differentiation<xref rid="pone.0024599-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024599-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, decreased upon induction similarly in all created cell lines and remained low during the entire course of the experiment. Monitoring of selected erythroid markers (AHSP, Hba and GATA-1) on the transcriptional
level also did not reveal significant differences among LP1-transduced, LP2-transduced and LN-transduced cell lines, confirmingthat PrP<sup>C</sup> silencing does not appear disturb the differentiation of MEL cells. In many cell cultures, the enhanced expression of PrP<sup>C</sup> was proposed to facilitate cytoprotective effects<xref rid="pone.0024599-Roucou2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, overexpression of exogenously delivered PrP<sup>C</sup> in MEL cells did not protect the cells against apoptosis initiated by serum withdrawal<xref rid="pone.0024599-Gougoumas2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We also found that silencing of PrP<sup>C</sup> did not seem to sensitize cells to apoptosis during differentiation, as demonstrated by a Trypan Blue exclusion assay and by monitoring of Bax expression by qRT-PCR. This result is concurrent with Christensen and Harris, who reevaluated former assays reporting a protective activity of PrP<sup>C</sup> and suggested that the presence of PrP<sup>C</sup> has only a modest effect in cytoprotection <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0024599-Christensen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Taken together, our results imply that, under normal conditions, PrP<sup>C</sup> seems dispensable for the erythroid differentiation of MEL cells. The pattern of PrP<sup>C</sup> regulation on erythroid precursors <italic>in vivo</italic> suggests that PrP<sup>C</sup> may play a role in the maturation of erythroblasts in erythroblastic islands. We can speculate that PrP<sup>C</sup>, which was shown to bind both laminin and the laminin receptor<xref rid="pone.0024599-Gauczynski1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024599-Graner1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, can be involved in cell-cell contacts in an erythroblastic niche, or with a surrounding extracellular matrix. Downregulation of PrP<sup>C</sup>, then, could play a role in the dissociation of matured reticulocytes from the erythroblastic niche. Such a role for PrP<sup>C</sup> is unlikely to be detected by the MEL cell model. Another explanation could be that PrP<sup>C</sup> exerts its function only under stress conditions. This hypothesis is consistent with the documented poor recovery of PrP<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice from experimental anemia<xref rid="pone.0024599-Zivny1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Finally, it is possible that the effect of PrP<sup>C</sup> silencing was compensated for by an unknown pathway or that the remaining expression is sufficient to sustain its role.</p><p>In conclusion, we created model cell lines with efficiently silenced expression of PrP<sup>C</sup>, which are the first of their kind and may serve as a valuable tool in subsequent searches for the function of PrP<sup>C</sup> beyond the erythroid differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Flow cytometry of mouse bone marrow and spleen erythroid precursors</title><p>The study was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague (Permit Number: 217/07).
