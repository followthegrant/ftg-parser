The involvement of the related and proximally-located nm23-2 gene in the suppression of tumour metastasis, however, has not yet been tested. In this study, we compared nm23-2 RNA levels in cell lines derived from three independent rat mammary carcinomas. Northern blot analysis revealed no correlation between nm23-2 RNA levels and metastatic potential in parent or clonal cell lines derived from chemically-induced (MAT 13762, DMBA-8) or spontaneous (BC1) rat mammary carcinomas. Cloning and sequencing of an nm23-2 cDNA from metastatic BC1 cells demonstrated that the predicted coding sequence of nm23-2 RNA in these cells was not inactivated by mutation. Further analysis showed that the nm23-2 gene was not down-regulated in H-ras-transfected metastatic clones or other metastatic cell lines derived from a spontaneous rat paraoral squamous cell carcinoma, B10. The data do not suggest a correlation between nm23-2 gene expression and metastasis-suppression in these tumours.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00201-0051-a" xlink:role="875"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00201-0050.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="874" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00201-0051.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="875" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00201-0052.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="876" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00201-0053.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="877" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00201-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="878" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
