Antiretroviral therapy ameliorates HIVAN without eradicating HIV from the kidneys and the mechanism by which it protects kidneys is poorly understood. Since HIV protease inhibitors have &#x0201c;off target&#x0201d; cellular effects, we studied whether darunavir, the most commonly prescribed protease inhibitor, protects kidneys from HIV-induced injury via mechanisms independent of HIV protease and viral replication. Renal epithelial cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding HIV (lacking protease and reverse transcriptase), Vpr, or vector control. Darunavir attenuated HIV and Vpr-induced activation of Stat3, Src, Erk, and cytokines, which are critical for HIVAN pathogenesis. We then studied HIV-transgenic mice, which develop HIVAN in the absence of HIV protease or reverse transcriptase. Mice were treated with darunavir, zidovudine, darunavir&#x02009;+&#x02009;zidovudine, or control. Darunavir and darunavir&#x02009;+&#x02009;zidovudine reduced albuminuria and histologic kidney injury and normalized expression of dysregulated proteins. RNA-seq analyses demonstrated that darunavir suppressed HIV-induced upregulation of immune response genes in human kidney cells. These data demonstrate that darunavir protects against HIV-induced renal injury via mechanisms that are independent of inhibition of HIV protease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Molecular medicine</kwd><kwd>Nephrology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (National Institute of Diabetes &#x00026; Digestive &#x00026; Kidney Diseases)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK101338</award-id><award-id>R01DK108346</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>Michael J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (National Institute of Diabetes &#x00026; Digestive &#x00026; Kidney Diseases)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA013330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>Michael J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a dramatic decrease in AIDS-related mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As persons living with HIV (PLWH) live longer, non-AIDS conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) have become increasingly important causes of patient morbidity and mortality. Kidney disease is the fourth-leading disease contributing to death in PLWH in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is an important cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in PLWH, usually occurs in late in the course of HIV-infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and predominantly strikes persons of African Ancestry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Since approximately 25.7 million of the 37 million HIV-positive persons worldwide live in Africa, 43% of whom do not receive ART<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, HIV-related kidney disease is a particularly important problem in Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">HIVAN was the most rapidly rising cause of ESRD in African Americans aged 25&#x02013;64 in the early 1990s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Though some reports suggested that zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy reduced progression of HIVAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, it was not until the widespread adoption of combination ART regimens that included reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease inhibitors (PI), that the incidence of ESRD due to HIVAN suddenly plateaued<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">ART initiation is associated with improved kidney function in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS with CKD of unknown etiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, suggesting that ART may have efficacy in treating kidney diseases other than HIVAN. Since some ART agents have been associated with increased risk of CKD progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, it is critical to better understand the effects of ART upon the kidney in the context of HIVAN and other forms of CKD. Importantly, a recent study suggested that the PI saquinavir is effective in treating HIV-<italic>negative</italic> patients with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, suggesting that PI may protect the kidneys via mechanisms independent of suppression of HIV replication.</p><p id="Par5">While it is widely accepted that ART has efficacy in the prevention and treatment of HIVAN, the mechanism by which ART protects the kidneys is uncertain. In a patient with HIVAN who underwent kidney biopsy before and after clinical and histologic resolution of disease after ART treatment, there was no decrease in HIV RNA in renal parenchymal cells after treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, suggesting ART does not prevent/treat HIVAN by reducing the burden of HIV infection of renal epithelial cells.</p><p id="Par6">Tg26 is the most commonly used animal model of HIVAN and these mice are transgenic for a g<italic>ag/pol</italic>-deleted HIV provirus under control of the endogenous viral LTR promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Since <italic>gag</italic> encodes major viral structural proteins and <italic>pol</italic> encodes reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), and integrase (IN) (the targets of most ART medications), this model demonstrates that viral replication and expression of RT, PR, or IN are unnecessary for the HIVAN phenotype in mice. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models have demonstrated that expression of HIV-1 Vpr and/or Nef in renal epithelial cells, in the absence of viral replication, is a key mediator of HIVAN pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. While Nef likely has important roles in glomerular injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, Vpr induces injury in glomeruli and tubular cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Since there has been a major shift away from use of PI-based ART regimens in PLWH toward integrase strand inhibitor (INSTI)-based regiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, it is critical to determine whether PI confer particular benefit in patients with HIVAN or other forms of CKD.

Further, DRV normalized expression of WT1 and synaptopodin in podocytes in Tg26 mice. Since the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies used HIV vectors lacking HIV PR and Tg26 mice develop the HIVAN phenotype in the absence of HIV PR or HIV replication, the protective effects of DRV in these studies could not have been mediated through suppression of HIV PR or viral replication. Moreover, our RNAseq data revealed that though DRV had minimal effects upon RNA expression in control-transduced cells, it prevented HIV-induced upregulation of immune response genes and downregulation of genes involved in chromatin modification/organization and RNA transcription.

Nonetheless, it remains possible that DRV has a subtle effect on proteasomal degradation of specific substrates that was not detected by our assays. Studies are underway in our laboratory to identify the cellular protein(s) that bind DRV and the data and pathway analyses from the RNAseq studies will be useful in narrowing the list of candidate proteins. Though DRV is a PI, it also inhibits non-protease enzymes including cytochrome P450 3&#x02009;A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.

Despite continued albuminuria, glomerular and tubular histologic injury and molecular markers of HIV-induced glomerular and tubular injury were nearly completely ameliorated.

We chose to use DRV in these studies for two reasons. First, neither saquinavir or nelfinavir are commonly used due to the improved side effect profiles and dosing options of newer PIs such as DRV, which is now the most commonly prescribed PI. Second, DRV is less likely to cause kidney injury due to intratubular crystallization, which has been most commonly reported with indinavir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, but also can occur with atazanavir (especially ritonavir-boosted regimens), or lopinavir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.
