Thus, studying of pre-existing immunity to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (2009 H1N1) will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this emerging pathogen. In the present study, sera were collected from 486 individuals in a hospital in Shanghai, China, before the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The serum anti-hemagglutinins (HA) antibody, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody and neutralizing antibody against the 2009 H1N1 were assayed. Among this population, 84.2%, 14.61% and 26.5% subjects possessed anti-HA antibody, HI antibody and neutralizing antibody, respectively. Although neutralizing antibody only existed in those sera with detectable anti-HA antibody, there was no obvious correlation between the titers of anti-HA and neutralizing antibody. However, the titers of anti-HA and neutralizing antibody against seasonal H1N1 virus were highly correlated. In the same population, there was no correlation between titers of neutralizing antibody against 2009 H1N1 and seasonal H1N1. DNA immunization performed on mice demonstrated that antibodies to the HA of 2009 pandemic and seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses were strain-specific and had no cross-neutralizing activity. In addition, the predicted conserved epitope in the HA of 2009 H1N1 and recently circulating seasonal H1N1 virus, GLFGAIAGFIE, was not an immunologically valid B-cell epitope. The data in this report are valuable for advancing our understanding of 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by research grants from Natural Science Foundation of China (81071364, 31170150) and Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project (B901).

Indeed, the prevalence of a specific epidemic influenza virus strain decreases significantly when broad immunity is established throughout the host population, and increases when the immune barrier is (or becomes) weak. The novel influenza virus, 2009 H1N1, first emerged in mid-April 2009 and initiated the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century <xref rid="pone.0058810-Scalera1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Despite initial concern that little protective immunity existed in the general population, subsequent epidemiological data showed that morbidity in the elderly was lower than that in younger individuals, suggesting the existence of pre-existing immunity <xref rid="pone.0058810-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0058810-Xing1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Phylogenetic analyses on the HA of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus demonstrated its close relationship with the 1918&#x02013;1919 Spanish H1N1 virus. Molecular analyses showed that the structures of the HAs of both 2009 and 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus strains were very similar <xref rid="pone.0058810-Garten1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Serological cross-section studies performed on a variety of human populations demonstrated protective immunity in elderly individuals <xref rid="pone.0058810-ItohYShinya1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058810-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The current strategy for influenza virus control and prevention is primarily dependent on vaccination along with therapeutic and prophylactic use of neuraminidase inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0058810-Democratis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Vaccination is a passive response to the emergence of novel influenza virus strains <xref rid="pone.0058810-Gerdil1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058810-Subbarao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Thus, improvements in the global anti-influenza strategy are required. Since influenza is so common, understanding the nature of the host immune response to influenza virus is vital. To date, protective immunity to influenza has been regarded as futile, due to the overwhelming number of novel emerging reassorted viruses as well as antigenic shifts and drift in their HA molecules. However, influenza epidemics display a wave pattern, which suggests a contribution of pre-existing immunity <xref rid="pone.0058810-Chowell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058810-Mathews1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Thus, investigation of protective immunity will advance our understanding of influenza biology and benefit our efforts in influenza control and prevention.</p><p>In this study, to evaluate the presence of antibodies against 2009 H1N1 in the general population in Shanghai, China, IgG levels and neutralizing activity against both 2009 pandemic and a seasonal H1N1 virus were assessed in 486 serum samples collected prior to 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak.

This was not significantly higher than that of seasonal influenza. Pre-existing immunity has been assumed to contribute to the overall low morbidity <xref rid="pone.0058810-Xing1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, because the novel pandemic influenza virus contained a unique reassortment of gene segments from both North American and Eurasian swine lineages <xref rid="pone.0058810-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, it was initially supposed that little protective immune memory existed in the general human population. Greenbaum et al. analyzed immune epitopes of recently circulating H1N1 and H3N2 virus strains and found that although eight epitopes were conserved in 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, only a single B cell epitope was conserved in 2009 HA <xref rid="pone.0058810-Greenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This suggested that only low levels of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies were present in the general human population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) reported that among persons &#x0003e;60 years old, 34% had pre-existing, cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against the new virus <xref rid="pone.0058810-Hancock1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Additionally, Itoh et al. reported that no appreciable neutralizing antibodies against CA04 (A/California/04/09) were detected in individuals born after 1920; however, many of those born before 1918 had these antibodies in high titers <xref rid="pone.0058810-ItohYShinya1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Many serological studies performed on geographically diverse populations also demonstrated pre-existing neutralizing antibodies, with the exception of one report from Singapore <xref rid="pone.0058810-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0058810-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The authors suggested that pre-existing immunity in elderly subjects had been elicited by infection with 1918-related H1N1 virus.</p><p>In the present study, high levels of neutralizing antibodies existed in the Chinese population before the 2009 pandemic H1N1; as many as 84.16% of subjects were seropositive for 2009 HA and 26.5% of sera could neutralize 2009 pandemic virus. The ratios of neutralizing antibody positivity increased with age, and many subjects possessed a high neutralizing antibody titer, consistent with the low morbidity reported in this area. A study performed in Guangxi Province, mainland China, suggested that only 0.3% of subjects possessed low titers of neutralizing antibody, which differed from our findings <xref rid="pone.0058810-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Since the neutralizing activity was checked by HI and MN in our study, the differences in population and region/location may be the reason. In fact, human H1N1 viruses circulated in the population from 1918 to 1957 and again from 1977 till now. The classical swine virus HA gene of 2009 pandemic H1N1 is a descendant of the 1918 pandemic virus, and in 1977, H1N1 viruses re-emerged that were genetically and antigenically very closely related to viruses circulating in the 1950s <xref rid="pone.0058810-Dowdle1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0058810-Tumpey1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Thus all of these circulating viruses may had elicited and/or boosted the neutralizing antibody response to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus in subjects of all ages.</p><p>On mainland China, due to the extremely high human, swine, and poultry population density, and environmental contamination, influenza viruses might cause undetected infections. The prevalence of antibodies against hepatitis A and E viruses in individuals aged over 40 were approximately 100% and 40%, respectively; the aforementioned factors were believed to be the major reasons for such high rates <xref rid="pone.0058810-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The positive rate of anti-HA and neutralizing antibody against 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus presented here suggested that many of the subjects in this study had been exposed to antigenically related viruses. Our data also suggest that many subjects had been exposed repeatedly to unidentified viruses, including the virus strains with hemagglutinins related with 2009 pandemic and seasonal H1N1 strains antigenically, thus inducing immunity to a particular influenza strain. The unexpectedly robust immune response of Chinese subjects vaccinated with inactivated 2009 pandemic H1N1 support this view <xref rid="pone.0058810-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>There was an obvious discrepancy of the proportions: the total anti-HA antibodies rate (84.2%), MN antibodies rate (26.5%) and HI antibodies rate (14.61%), but all the MN positive sera were also anti-HA positive, and all the HI positive sera were MN positive. Compared with the subjects immunized 2009 H1N1 vaccines, the correlation between anti-HA titers and MN titers of the general population was relatively lower. It may be explained by different epitopes in HA involved in immune response. In this regard, major anti-HA antibodies may target the conserved stalk region of HA, while the neutralizing antibodies were against the hypervariable globular head of HA. On the other hand, as described above, our data may also indicate that the immunity against 2009 H1N1 in general Shanghainese was derived from complicated circulating influenza viruses, this possibility was supported by studies from Taiwan and France <xref rid="pone.0058810-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058810-Lemaitre1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Additionally, a monoclonal antibody recognizing a neutralizing epitope common among H1, H2, H5, and H6 was demonstrated to protect mice from a lethal challenge with various H5N1 and 2009 H1N1 <xref rid="pone.0058810-Sakabe1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Consistent with these observations, more recently, it was reported that neutralizing antibodies induced by 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection were broadly reactive against divergent H1N1 and H5N1 influenza strains <xref rid="pone.0058810-Wrammert1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>A 2009 H1N1 isolate was more pathogenic in mice and ferrets with no previous exposure to influenza, indicating that pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies might offer partial protection against novel influenza strains <xref rid="pone.0058810-Maines1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Several studies demonstrated that the seasonal influenza vaccines did not elicit cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus in subjects of any age <xref rid="pone.0058810-Pascua1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0058810-Centers2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In this study, we investigated this by assessing the immune response of mice immunized using HA-encoding plasmids. The results showed that only very low level of cross-reactive HA antibody was induced and the immune sera exerted little cross-neutralization. Additionally, the only predicted conserved linear epitope GLFGAIAGFIE in HAs among diverse H1N1 strains was demonstrated as invalid, suggesting the rarity of cross protective epitopes in 2009 H1N1 and seasonal H1N1 virus. Together with the observation that natural infection with some seasonal H1N1 viruses may induce a cross-reactive antibody response to the 2009 H1N1 virus, it is possible that cross-neutralization epitopes exist among 2009 H1N1 and other influenza virus strains <xref rid="pone.0058810-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0058810-Lemaitre1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Whether immune responses to different influenza viruses can amplify each other, and precisely how many strain-specific humoral immune responses exist in Shanghainese population, is remained to be investigated in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0058810-Cao1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
