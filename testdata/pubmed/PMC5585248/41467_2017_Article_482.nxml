Monitoring specific cell types and their progeny in a non-invasive, longitudinal and quantitative manner is still challenging. Here we show a novel cell-tracking system that combines Cre/lox-assisted cell fate mapping with a thymidine kinase (sr39tk) reporter gene for cell detection by positron emission tomography (PET). We generate Rosa26-mT/sr39tk PET reporter mice and induce sr39tk expression in platelets, T lymphocytes or cardiomyocytes. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that our mouse model permits longitudinal PET imaging and quantification of T-cell homing during inflammation and cardiomyocyte viability after myocardial infarction. Moreover, Rosa26-mT/sr39tk mice are useful for whole-body characterization of transgenic Cre mice and to detect previously unknown Cre activity. We anticipate that the Cre-switchable PET reporter mice will be broadly applicable for non-invasive long-term tracking of selected cell populations in vivo.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Non-invasive cell tracking is a powerful method to visualize cells in vivo under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

In addition to its importance for basic research, cell tracking has many potential applications in regenerative and individualized medicine and it facilitates the development of new diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Numerous imaging techniques are used to visualize cells in vivo, including ultrasound, optical imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). These methods require conceptually different labeling and detection strategies that each have inherent advantages and disadvantages. Direct cell labeling makes use of radioactive, fluorescent or paramagnetic compounds, which are, however, eventually washed out and get diluted. Thus, longitudinal and quantitative monitoring of cells becomes challenging. In contrast, strategies based on stable expression of a chromosomally integrated reporter transgene permit long-term labeling of cells and their progeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The Cre/lox recombination system has emerged as a powerful tool to generate time- and tissue-specific mouse mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, this technology can be used to genetically label specific cell populations to map their fate during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> or in adult mice in the context of physiological or pathophysiological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For genetically inducible fate mapping, cell type-specific expression of the tamoxifen-inducible CreER<sup>T2</sup> recombinase is combined with Cre-activatable reporter transgenes that are driven by ubiquitous promoters. With this approach, stable, inheritable reporter gene expression can be achieved in a distinct cell population labeled by Cre recombination at a predetermined time. Cre reporter transgenes encoding histochemical, fluorescent or bioluminescent reporter proteins have been integrated into the murine Rosa26 (R26) locus, which is accessible to the transcriptional machinery in most if not all cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. With the currently available R26 Cre reporter mouse lines, however, non-invasive quantitative detection of labeled cells in vivo at the whole-body level is not possible, because detection of the aforementioned reporter proteins relies on either ex vivo methods requiring tissue fixation, invasive methods with a small field of view such as intravital microscopy, or semi-quantitative non-invasive methods such as bioluminescence imaging.</p><p id="Par5">PET is a powerful non-invasive imaging modality in both preclinical and clinical settings. It has a high sensitivity and generates quantitative data, and recent advances in PET-MRI scanner technology enable simultaneous acquisition of functional and morphological information from living mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Reporter genes for detection of cells by PET cause the accumulation of radiolabeled probes on or in reporter gene-expressing cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. One such PET reporter gene is the <italic>herpes simplex</italic> virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk). It is used in combination with <sup>18</sup>F- or <sup>124</sup>I-labeled nucleoside analogues, which are phosphorylated by HSV1-tk, but not by mammalian thymidine kinases. In their non-phosphorylated form, PET tracers such as 9-(4[<sup>18</sup>F]-Fluoro-3-[hydroxymethyl]butyl)guanine are &#x0201c;cell-permeable&#x0201d;, but after phosphorylation by HSV1-tk they are retained inside the cells. HSV1-tk or an improved variant that enables PET with higher sensitivity, sr39tk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, have been used for PET imaging of rodents, larger animals and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Cre-mediated activation of HSV1-tk expression has been achieved via the delivery of an adenovirus carrying a Cre-activatable HSV1-tk construct to the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> or myocardium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> of mice expressing Cre in the respective target tissues. However, transgenic mice with a chromosomally integrated Cre-responsive PET reporter gene have not been described to date. In such a mouse line, Cre-expressing cell populations will be labeled for PET imaging through Cre-mediated activation of reporter gene expression at the genomic level. Once reporter gene expression is activated, cells and their progeny are stably labeled, even if the cells proliferate or change their phenotype, which may lead to a loss of Cre expression. This approach would permit non-invasive long-term visualization of any given cell population for which a respective cell type-specific Cre mouse line is available.</p><p id="Par6">To improve cell tracking in mammals, we generated R26 knock-in mice carrying a transgene for Cre-inducible sr39tk expression under control of the ubiquitous cytomegalovirus early enhancer/chicken &#x003b2;-actin/&#x003b2;-globin (CAG) promoter. As these mice express membrane-targeted tandem-dimer tomato red fluorescent protein (mT) before Cre recombination and sr39tk after Cre recombination, we named them &#x0201c;R26-mT/sr39tk&#x0201d; mice. In these mice, a cell population of interest is labeled by Cre-dependent activation of sr39tk expression and then the fate of these cells is followed by non-invasive PET imaging with [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that the new R26-mT/sr39tk reporter mice enable cell type-specific longitudinal PET imaging of T-cell homing during tissue inflammation and of cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction (MI). Furthermore, the Cre-responsive PET reporter allele permits non-invasive whole-body characterization of transgenic Cre mouse lines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Generation of R26-mT/sr39tk mice</title><p id="Par7">We integrated the R26-mT/sr39tk PET reporter construct by homologous recombination into the R26 locus of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. Before Cre recombination, mT is expressed from the L2 allele, where &#x0201c;L2&#x0201d; stands for &#x0201c;two loxP sites&#x0201d;. In Cre-expressing cells, Cre recombinase removes the mT-encoding expression cassette and thereby activates sr39tk expression from the resulting L1 allele (&#x0201c;L1&#x0201d; stands for one loxP site) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). Cre-mediated activation of sr39tk expression in ES cells was confirmed at multiple levels: at the DNA level by Southern blot analysis (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>), at the protein level by western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>), and at the functional level by testing the sensitivity of the cells to the sr39tk suicide substrate ganciclovir (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>), as well as by measuring uptake of the PET tracer [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG into the cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>). ES cells carrying the Cre-responsive L2 allele were used to establish the R26-mT/sr39tk mouse line. In line with previous publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, which used the same targeting vector but different reporter genes, we observed strong and ubiquitous mT expression in organs isolated from R26-mT/sr39tk mice (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1f</xref>). The general appearance and viability of R26-mT/sr39tk mice (genotype: R26[sr39tk/+], where &#x0201c;+&#x0201d; denotes the wild-type allele) was normal. However, male R26-mT/sr39tk mice showed severely reduced fertility. Male infertility has been described for some other HSV1-tk transgenic mouse lines and is presumably caused by HSV1-tk expression from a cryptic promotor located in the HSV1-tk coding region that is active in postmeiotic germ cells leading to impaired sperm development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, female R26-mT/sr39tk mice, which showed normal fertility and litter sizes, were used to maintain the R26-mT/sr39tk line and for crossbreeding with transgenic Cre mice.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Strategy for PET-based cell tracking with the R26-mT/sr39tk mouse line. <bold>a</bold> Generation of experimental animals for PET imaging. R26-mT/sr39tk mice carry the Cre-activatable R26-mT/sr39tk transgene that has been integrated via homologous recombination into the Rosa26 (R26) locus. In R26-mT/sr39tk mice, sr39tk expression is blocked by a loxP-flanked (<italic>triangles</italic>) gene cassette encoding membrane-targeted tandem dimer tomato red fluorescent protein (mT). R26-mT/sr39tk mice are mated with mice that express Cre (or CreER<sup>T2</sup>) under control of a cell type-specific promoter (e.g., Pf4, CD4 or Myh6). In progeny mice, Cre recombination activates sr39tk expression in the respective target cell population (blue shaded oval) as shown in detail in <bold>b</bold>. <bold>b</bold> Strategy for Cre-dependent sr39tk expression and labeling of distinct cell types. The R26-mT/sr39tk L2 allele (carrying two loxP sites) encodes sr39tk preceded by a loxP-flanked (<italic>triangles</italic>) sequence encoding the mT protein. From the L2 allele, mT but not sr39tk is expressed. In cells expressing Cre recombinase, the mT cassette is removed and thereby the L2 allele is converted to the L1 allele (carrying one loxP site), from which sr39tk is expressed under control of the ubiquitous CAG promoter. Sr39tk phosphorylates the tracer molecule [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG, which cannot leave the cell once phosphorylated. [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG accumulation in sr39tk-expressing cell populations allows their in vivo detection by PET imaging. See also Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>

Compared with wild-type mice (genotype: Cre[+/+],R26[+/+]), CD4/sr39tk mice had a smaller number of CD3<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes, which was primarily due to a smaller fraction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b&#x02013;d</xref>).

A cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (DTHR) was induced in CD4/sr39tk (sr39tk+) mice and, as a control for nonspecific tracer uptake, in Cre-negative mice (sr39tk&#x02212;). In our animal model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, mice were first sensitized at the abdomen by application of 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB) at day 0. Then, we elicited a cutaneous DTHR on the left ear by repetitive application of TNCB on day 7, 10 and 12, and used [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG-PET to follow homing of sr39tk-expressing T lymphocytes to the left ear. PET imaging was performed on day 6 (1 day before the first TNCB challenge), on day 13 (1 day after the last TNCB challenge) and on day 20 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The degree of inflammation was determined by measuring ear thickness before and after TNCB ear challenges (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>). On day 13, 12&#x02009;h after the last TNCB ear challenge, PET imaging of the animals revealed strong accumulation of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG in the challenged left ear, but not in the non-challenged right ear of sr39tk+ mice or in ears of sr39tk&#x02212; control animals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Compared with baseline on day 6, [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG uptake into the TNCB-challenged left ears of sr39tk+ mice was &#x02248;6-fold higher in each animal on day 13 and then returned to a lower level on day 20 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>

This system relies on stable expression of the sr39tk PET reporter in the cells of interest as well as their progeny. In addition to enabling in vivo cell tracking at the whole-body level, our approach has several advantages over cell-tracking methods that are based on direct cell labeling or expression of a reporter transgene driven by a cell-type-specific promoter. As the sr39tk transgene is integrated into the genome, it permits stable cell labeling that is passed on to all progeny cells. Initially, expression of sr39tk is silenced, but it can be activated in the cell type of interest by crossbreeding with an appropriate cell-type-specific Cre mouse line. Once activated, sr39tk expression is driven by the ubiquitous CAG promoter, rendering it independent of subsequent changes of cell differentiation and potential silencing of tissue-specific promoters. Furthermore, no ex vivo labeling procedures are required, i.e., the cell population of interest is labeled in situ in its physiological environment.</p><p id="Par18">As a proof of concept, we labeled and visualized various cell types by PET imaging and we validated our new mouse model for longitudinal non-invasive cell tracking in two clinically relevant disease models.

In general, expression of sr39tk did not cause gross abnormalities in the number and/or function of the target cells. We noted that the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was reduced in CD4/sr39tk mice as compared with control mice, but the TNCB-specific response of sr39tk-expressing T cells in the context of our DTHR model was apparently not compromised, as the extent of ear swelling in CD4/sr39tk mice was similar to control mice not expressing sr39tk. The reason for the lower T-cell number in CD4/sr39tk mice is not clear. It is unlikely that it was caused by the potential immunogenicity of the sr39tk protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, because CD4/sr39tk mice express the protein permanently and should, therefore, not mount an immune response against it.</p><p id="Par19">Platelets, T cells and cardiomyocytes could be visualized in vivo in anesthetized mice and specific [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG uptake in these cells was confirmed by ex vivo analyses. In few cases, in vivo detection of the respective target cells was compromised by nonspecific accumulation of radioactivity and/or unexpected Cre activity in some tissues. For instance, it was difficult to detect T cells in distinct lymph nodes and the thymus of CD4/sr39tk mice in vivo. Visualization of lymph nodes was impeded by background radioactivity in the bone and gastrointestinal tract, whereas the thymus was masked by [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG accumulation in the heart and lungs. The latter was due to previously unknown activity of the CD4-Cre transgene in non-lymphocyte cells of heart and lung. The problem of ectopic Cre activity can be solved by using Cre lines with alternative promoters to drive Cre expression. The current limitation in quantifying T cells in lymph nodes could be overcome by increasing the purity of the [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG preparation, which was 82&#x02013;92% in the present study, thereby reducing the amount of free [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoride, which accumulates in the bone. Background radioactivity in the gastrointestinal tract could be reduced by increasing [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG elimination via the intestine or by using alternative sr39tk substrates with faster clearance such as [<sup>18</sup>F]FEAU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

With [<sup>124</sup>I]-labeled radiotracers, PET imaging can be performed much later after tracer injection than with short-lived [<sup>18</sup>F]-labeled tracers, thereby allowing more &#x02018;non-trapped&#x02019; tracer to be eliminated before image acquisition. Another approach to reduce background signals could be the use of alternative PET reporter genes such as the human or rat sodium iodide symporter. However, the respective tracer, iodine, may show the problem of insufficient intracellular retention due to iodine efflux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">Detailed knowledge of the specificity of Cre recombination is not only important for cell tracking experiments as described in the present study, but also when Cre mice are used to generate tissue-specific gene knockouts. Published characterization data for Cre strains are often limited to a few specific tissues that were studied in the context of a focused research question. However, it is increasingly recognized that any given transgenic Cre line may display recombination activity beyond the intended tissue or cell type. Therefore, careful characterization of Cre mouse lines is warranted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The R26-mT/sr39tk reporter mouse provides the possibility for recombination profiling of transgenic Cre mice on a whole-body scale using PET imaging. This novel approach complements existing strategies for comprehensive Cre strain characterization that are based on post-mortem analyses of conventional LacZ Cre reporter mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.creportal.org">http://www.creportal.org</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Indeed, using our sr39tk PET reporter mice for whole-body imaging combined with the LacZ Cre reporter for subsequent post-mortem analyses of tissue sections, we have identified several previously unreported activities of commonly used Cre strains. Ectopic activity was detected in CD4-Cre mice in smooth muscle cells of myocardial blood vessels as well as in alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells of the lung, and in Myh6-Cre mice in the lung vasculature.</p><p id="Par21">Among the most exciting applications of our novel sr39tk PET reporter mouse are longitudinal cell tracking studies in the context of health, disease and therapy. For example, tracking of T lymphocytes on the whole-body level can improve our understanding of immune responses to infections and malignancies or during immunotherapy. Diverse procedures have been developed to label T cells in vitro for subsequent PET imaging in mice and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. However, these experiments are often limited by label dilution and artificial signal loss caused by the proliferation of T cells in the course of an immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In CD4/sr39tk mice we were able, without the need for in vitro labeling, to follow the homing of endogenous CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes to sites of TNCB-specific tissue inflammation over several weeks.</p><p id="Par22">In another clinically relevant disease model, we used Myh6i/sr39tk mice to monitor cardiomyocyte viability after MI. In both preclinical and clinical studies, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG is often used for this purpose. However, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG reports cellular glucose uptake and metabolism, which are subject to complex regulation and alterations under pathophysiological conditions such as ischemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Moreover, uptake of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG is not cell-type specific. In addition to cardiomyocytes, other cells in the myocardium may accumulate [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG, in particular immune cells in the context of post-infarct inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. For these reasons, detection of sr39tk-labeled cardiomyocytes with [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG appears to be a more robust approach than [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG imaging, to specifically assess cardiomyocyte viability in animal models of cardiac disorders. Thus, we sought to use [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG-PET for specific detection of cardiomyocytes and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG under conditions that favor its uptake into immune cells over cardiomyocytes for PET imaging of post-infarct inflammation. Sr39tk or related PET reporters have previously been expressed in rodent cardiomyocytes using adenoviral approaches, but expression was limited to the adenovirus-infected region and began to vanish some days after virus administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In contrast, in Myh6i/sr39tk mice we observed uniform and stable sr39tk expression in the entire myocardium, which allowed longitudinal tracking of cardiomyocyte viability in sub-regions of the heart after MI. The spatial profile and relative amount of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG uptake after MI induction remained constant over the whole 3-week period of our study. The combination of PET imaging with [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG enabled us to characterize infarcts in detail by visualization of viable cardiomyocytes and post-infarct inflammation, respectively. The fact that permanent LAD ligation results in almost complete loss of perfusion of the infarcted zone might complicate the interpretation of tracer uptake in this region after permanent LAD ligation. However, after I/R injury, perfusion is maintained and thus it appears that the stable reduction of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG uptake in the infarcted region was indeed due to cardiomyocyte death rather than loss of perfusion. In contrast, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake after I/R injury was initially increased in the infarcted region and was more variable over time, presumably due to inflammatory processes within the infarcted region and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake into immune cells.</p><p id="Par23">Taken together, this study demonstrates the suitability of our novel sr39tk PET reporter mouse for non-invasive visualization, quantification and tracking of specific cell populations in mice. The binary nature of the system permits labeling of a broad spectrum of cell types by crossbreeding the sr39tk reporter line with different Cre strains, several hundreds of which are available for targeting basically any cell type of interest (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.creportal.org">http://www.creportal.org</ext-link>). It is also possible to combine the sr39tk PET reporter allele with other Cre-switchable reporter transgenes. This enables, for instance, combined in vivo imaging of cells by PET and other modalities (e.g., fluorescence, bioluminescence) or validation of PET data by post-mortem histochemical cell detection by X-Gal staining of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity. Moreover, combination of the sr39tk PET reporter with Cre-sensitive conditional knockout alleles allows in vivo-tracking of cell populations that lack a protein of interest. Previous methods for cell tracking with PET were based on direct in vitro-labeling of cells or transgenic expression of a PET reporter protein under the control of a tissue-specific promoter. Our Cre/lox-based PET reporter approach has one major advantage over these methods, in that it permits in vivo labeling of essentially any cell type of interest followed by stable/inheritable expression of the PET reporter protein irrespective of cell phenotype and potential silencing of a tissue-specific promoter. The latter property might be particularly useful to keep track of initially labeled cells after dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation, for instance, during vascular remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> or cell therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. If tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinases such as CreER<sup>T2</sup> are used for cell labeling, it should be considered that only cells will be labeled that expressed the recombinase during the tamoxifen pulse and that these cells might later be &#x0201c;diluted&#x0201d; by non-labeled cells originating from a pool of CreER<sup>T2</sup>-negative progenitor cells. For instance, if in our MI model newly formed cardiomyocytes were derived from sr39tk&#x02212; progenitor cells, then these cardiomyocytes would not take up [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG, and cell viability would be underestimated by [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG-PET. In general, labeling of rapidly proliferating cell populations with tamoxifen-inducible CreER<sup>T2</sup> may be mosaic and, therefore, non-recombined cells may dilute the reporter signal when they proliferate. This problem can be addressed by using a non-inducible Cre line, for instance, the Myh6-Cre line for efficient labeling of cardiomyocytes.</p><p id="Par24">We foresee many applications of our sr39tk PET reporter mice in preclinical research. In combination with MRI or other PET tracers (as shown in the present study), this mouse line will improve our understanding of mammalian (patho-)biology associated with migration, accumulation, death, or survival of distinct cell populations. These processes are of fundamental importance in clinical conditions such as inflammation, diabetes, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, MI, stroke and tumorigenesis. Our method will also be useful to elucidate endogenous mechanisms of tissue degeneration and regeneration as well as effects of therapeutic interventions. Cells derived from sr39tk PET reporter ES cells or mice can aid the development of effective cell-based therapies, which requires monitoring of the location, distribution and long-term viability of the transplanted cells in a non-invasive manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

We anticipate that the Cre-switchable sr39tk PET reporter mice will be broadly applicable to address complex biological questions in vivo and, compared to invasive cell-tracking methods, enable preclinical research with fewer animals and complementary informative value.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Experimental animals</title><p id="Par25">All animal experiments were performed at the University of T&#x000fc;bingen and approved by the local authority (Regierungspr&#x000e4;sidium T&#x000fc;bingen, PC 1/08 and IB 1/13).
