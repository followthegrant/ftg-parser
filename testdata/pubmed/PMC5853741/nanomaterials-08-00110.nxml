Introduction</title><p>Anthracycline antitumor antibiotics are amongst the most powerful agents for the treatment of solid malignancies and can boast a wide range of antitumor activity. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (adriamycin) is the most commonly used and is effective in the treatment of carcinomas of the breast, lung, thyroid, ovary and soft tissue sarcomas [<xref rid="B1-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, anthracycline therapy is associated with significant general organ toxicity and especially myelosuppression, mucositis and cardiac toxicity [<xref rid="B2-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Despite this widespread use of anthracyclines in cancer therapy, their limitations have continued to yield significant amounts of research. The main fields of anthracycline research are the continuing synthesis of novel anthracycline analogues to reverse drug resistance and reduce cardiotoxicity, while improving the delivery of anthracycline drugs is also an active field [<xref rid="B3-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. An important milestone in the field is found in the liposomal formulations Doxil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Caelyx<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) [<xref rid="B4-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Myocet<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> [<xref rid="B5-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed, doxorubicin-loaded liposomes exhibit efficiencies comparable to those of the conventional anthracycline cytostatic agents, but with less cardiotoxicity. Nevertheless, the administration of long-circulating liposomes in clinical practice has been associated with palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (&#x0201c;hand-foot&#x0201d; syndrome), which may evolve into ulceration and epidermal necrosis if the chemotherapy cycle is not delayed [<xref rid="B6-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Producing prodrug derivatives of doxorubicin is another way to approach improving activity against multidrug resistance and/or increasing cardiac tolerability [<xref rid="B7-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. An interesting doxorubicin prodrug, composed of a long lipophilic acyclic isoprenoid chain derived from squalene, has recently been created and tested. The conformation of squalene is greatly influenced by solvent polarity, so that in polar solvents, such as water, squalene takes a tightly-coiled conformation. This squalenoyl derivative of doxorubicin (SQ-Dox) is able to self-organize in water into unique &#x0201c;loop-train&#x0201d; elongated nanostructures with high stability [<xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The in vivo fate of squalenoyl nanoassemblies (NAs) has recently been described by Couvreur and co-workers, who have highlighted the prominent role played by endogenous lipoproteins (LDL) in the delivery of squalenoyl NAs in the bloodstream; LDL adsorb onto the NAs, which then disassemble, releasing squalenoyl bioconjugates that insert into lipoproteins. Thus, the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution are dependent on the LDL route [<xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are dispersed systems that display sizes ranging from 1&#x02013;1000 nm and represent an alternative to polymeric particulate carriers. They are composed of physiological or biocompatible lipids or lipid molecules with a history of safe use in therapy, and they are generally suitable for intravenous administration [<xref rid="B11-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Some authors have found that SLNs, which were loaded with doxorubicin, were able to overcome P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR), both in vitro in resistant leukemia cells and in vivo in the murine leukemia mouse model [<xref rid="B12-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The results suggested that SLNs, which have attracted huge research interest from the field of site-specific drug targeting, including brain delivery [<xref rid="B14-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], over the last few decades may be able to provide the potential to deliver anticancer drugs for the treatment of Pgp-mediated MDR. Indeed, SLNs have been proposed for use as innovative chemotherapeutic agent vehicles for experimental glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment, owing to their ability to enhance drug uptake by cells and evade the Pgp efflux system. It is well known that SLNs are subjected to endocytosis by endothelial cells and that they can also be exploited for passive and, if opportunely surface-modified, active targeting to the brain [<xref rid="B15-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Indeed, in order to increase cancer cell-selective cytotoxicity, one strategy is to surface-engineer drug delivery systems for molecular targeting. This strategy, which exploits the differences between cancer cells and healthy cells, has recently been adopted for SLN anticancer drug delivery. A folate receptor-targeted lipid nanoparticle system has been developed for the delivery of a paclitaxel prodrug [<xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Targeted nanoparticles showed elevated antitumor activity in mice bearing the M109 tumor with the marker folate receptor. Functionalization with a chimera peptide (Apo E), having a lipophilic moiety and an aminoacidic sequence for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor binding (ApoE), was exploited in order to target SLNs to the VLDL receptor. Enhancement of brain accumulation of lipophilic methotrexate prodrug by ApoE-conjugated SLNs was evident especially at longer post-administration times, when compared with non-functionalized SLNs [<xref rid="B17-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, as described in the literature, loading drugs into SLNs can often lead to their physico-chemical and hydrolytic stability being improved, as previously seen in fatty acid SLN-entrapped curcumin [<xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Thus, we herein investigate the feasibility of encapsulating the active lipophilic derivative SQ-Dox into SLNs in an effort to evaluate the potential of SLNs in releasing the active drug into tumor cells and with a view toward conferring improved properties to this anticancer prodrug. The lipid moiety in the conjugate can significantly enhance drug loading into the hydrophobic components of delivery carriers and thus generates formulations with improved drug loading and superior stability [<xref rid="B19-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The SLNs proposed in this study are prepared using the technique of fatty acid coacervation and are stabilized by biodegradable polymers with hydrophilic characteristics, which, once adsorbed onto the SLN surface, can prolong in vivo half-life by preventing opsonization.</p><p>For the above-mentioned purpose, SLNs were prepared and extensively characterized with regards to their physico-chemical properties, their loading capacity and their cytotoxic potency.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nanomaterials-08-00110"><title>2.

After stirring for 40 min at 30 &#x000b0;C, the resulting solution was poured into dry ether (200 mL), and the solid residue was filtered and washed with ether (50 mL &#x000d7; 3). The solid was re-crystallized from acetone/ether (1:1 (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>), 10 mL), filtered off, washed with ether and dried over P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> to give 14-bromo-daunorubicin (0.19 g, 84%), as a red solid with a melting point of 176&#x02013;177 &#x000b0;C.

Potassium carbonate (260 mg, 1.875 mmol) was then added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 48 h (dark). The solvent was evaporated and the crude product purified using silica gel flash column chromatography (95:5, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;MeOH), to give a red powder (249.5 mg, 43%).

Results</title><sec id="sec3dot1-nanomaterials-08-00110"><title>3.1. NA and SLN Preparation and Characterization</title><p>The nanoformulations containing SQ-Dox were prepared as described above. SLNs were prepared using the coacervation method, based on the precipitation of fatty acids. Precipitation occurred when the pH of a fatty acid-alkaline salt micellar solution was lowered by acidification in the presence of an appropriate polymeric stabilizer, which was able to confer hydrophilicity to the SLN surface [<xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Behenic acid sodium salt was chosen as the component of the lipid matrix as it has not shown any evidence of detectable cytotoxicity [<xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. SQ-Dox NAs were prepared by the nanoprecipitation process obtained by solvent displacement. All the formulations were prepared and checked in triplicate. The mean diameters (&#x000b1; standard error, S.E.), PDI and zeta potential of SLNs and SQ-Dox NAs were checked first using quasi-elastic light scattering (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nanomaterials-08-00110-t001">Table 1</xref>). SQ-Dox nanostructures displayed a low mean diameter, which was smaller than that of empty SLNs. The incorporation of the drug into SLNs increased the mean diameter of lipid nanoparticles to the 300&#x02013;400-nm range. Even if the zeta potential values fall down into the neutrality range of charged systems, small differences probably due to surface modifications can be observed. The zeta potential of the empty SLNs prepared by coacervation is around 0 mV [<xref rid="B18-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], because polyvinyl alcohol (PVA 9000), which was used as a stabilizer, locates itself externally, partially screening the surface charge [<xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the SQ-Dox-loaded SLNs, the zeta potential value also depended on the drug arrangement in the lipid matrix [<xref rid="B23-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], meaning that the slightly positive value shown by SQ-Dox SLNs can be due to the partial arrangement of the drug on the outside of the SLN surface. The slight difference between zeta potential of SLN1 and SLN2 can be due to the different amount of PVA (higher in SLN2) partially shielding the SLN surface. Anyway, these small differences probably do not contribute to significant variation of SLN stability.</p><p>The stability of the suspensions was checked by measuring mean size, both after long storage times (up to 45 days), at 4 &#x000b0;C in water and in cell medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal calf serum) for incubation times up to 72 h. Particle diameters were measured in water at a range of times, up to 45 days, and were practically unmodified. Growth media do not seem to influence SLN dimensions, as all formulations maintained their size (&#x000b1;5%), while the size of SQ-Dox NAs was significantly affected after 72 h at 37 &#x000b0;C in cell medium (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nanomaterials-08-00110-t001">Table 1</xref>). The stability of the active agent in each phase of the SLN preparation and storage was assessed by HPLC analysis. No significant amounts of SQ-Dox degradation products were observed (data not shown).</p><p>The amount of SQ-Dox in SLNs, as prepared by dispersion in 2% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> (SQ-Dox SLN1) and 3% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic> (SQ-Dox SLN2) PVA 9000 aqueous solution, is expressed as EE%. This value was calculated after SLN centrifugation and washing with ethanol:water 30:70 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>. Encapsulation efficiency was significantly influenced by PVA 9000 content; when the stabilizer percentage was increased from 2%&#x02013;3% <italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic>, a decrease in drug entrapment from 85&#x02013;50 &#x000b1; 3% (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic>) was noted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nanomaterials-08-00110-t001">Table 1</xref>). This was probably caused by PVA 9000 forming micelles in the aqueous phase, which were able to solubilize SQ-Dox. Nevertheless, SLNs showed good SQ-Dox loading capacity ranging from 4.0% for SQ-Dox SLN2 to 6.8% for SQ-Dox SLN1. Due to higher drug loading, the SLN1 formulation was chosen for further characterizations and tests on cancer cell lines.</p><p>The behavior of SQ-Dox was evaluated at the same temperature and pH conditions as the SLN preparation, since this derivative is able to self-assemble in water to form NAs. The obtained particles showed micrometric dimensions under QELS measurement, and large aggregates were observed under the microscope, meaning that the concomitant self-assembly of the conjugate can be ruled out.</p><p>SLN microphotographs are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00110-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Only particles with a mean diameter higher than 500 nm were clearly visualized, according to optical microscopy resolution power. Anyway, the presence of drug crystals was excluded by observation under polarized light. Moreover, when SQ-Dox was submitted to the same procedure used for SLN preparation in the absence of the lipid matrix, no self-assembled structures were evidenced. The observation of SLN suspensions under the optical microscope, although not a conclusive test for the physico-chemical characterization of SLNs, confirmed their formation. The possible presence of micellar structures was not detectable with optical microscopy, owing to the small size of micelles. The use of fluorescent light allowed SQ-Dox association with SLNs to be identified; dispersions of fluorescent SLNs were observed in both suspensions.</p><p>We move now to DSC measurements. A thermogram of SQ-Dox NAs reveals a broadened transition peak at a temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) of around 153 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nanomaterials-08-00110-t002">Table 2</xref>). A strongly lowered transition peak was observed, with a shift at lower temperature (about 141 &#x000b0;C), when the conjugate was incorporated into SLNs. This behavior is probably due to conjugate incorporation into the lipid matrix and to interactions with the nanoparticle structure. Moreover, thermograms of SLNs reveal a sharp melting peak at 75 &#x000b0;C, which is a little lower than that of raw BA.</p><p>According to Siekmann and Westesen [<xref rid="B24-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], melting point decreases in SLN colloidal systems can be caused by the colloidal dimensions of the particles and, in particular, their high surface-to-volume ratio. The melting point falls when bulk matrix material is turned into SLNs; the presence of impurities, surfactants and stabilizers could also have an influence on this phenomenon [<xref rid="B25-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The BA-SLNs&#x02019; peak was also maintained in the presence of the conjugate, which indicates that the nanoparticle structure was unmodified (data not shown).</p><p>The morphology of SQ-Dox SLN1 was investigated using AFM. A topography AFM image is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00110-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The structures evident in the image confirm the size measured by QELS, although the presence of a certain degree of aggregation can be observed. We also noted the surface roughness of the SLNs. Further investigation with cryo-transmission electron microscopy could be useful to clarify the morphology.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-nanomaterials-08-00110"><title>3.2.

While Dox is more efficient than SQ-Dox, SQ-Dox SLN1 induces an inhibitory effect that is similar to that of Dox in the A2780 cell line (Panel A). A2780 res cell proliferation was naturally affected only by the higher concentrations of Dox and SQ-Dox, which induced an inhibition of around 50%, while SQ-Dox SLN1 also remained effective at a concentration of 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M (Panel B).

The results showed that treatment with SQ-Dox SLN1 inhibited the A2780 cell line&#x02019;s ability to form colonies, similarly to Dox. However, SQ-Dox was slightly less efficient at the lowest concentrations (Panel A). SQ-Dox SLN1 was even more effective in the A2780 res cell line, proving that Dox is slowly released from the SLNs, which protects the drug from degradation and prevents efflux pump extrusion (Panel B).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot2-nanomaterials-08-00110"><title>3.2.2.

Treatment with SQ-Dox NAs and SQ-Dox SLN1, at all concentrations tested, significantly increased caspase-3 activity in A2780 cells, as compared to Dox-treated cells.

SQ-Dox NAs and SQ-Dox SLN1; Levels of Annexin-V</title><p>A further assessment of SQ-Dox SLN1&#x02019;s ability to induce cell death was obtained by analyzing annexin-V staining, for the detection of both apoptotic and necrotic cells, in A2780 and A2780 res cells cultured in the presence and absence of titrated amounts of Dox and SQ-Dox NAs, as well as loaded and empty SLNs for 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-08-00110-f006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The results obtained show that SQ-Dox NAs and SQ-Dox SLN1 induced higher annexin-V staining in the A2780 cell line than free Dox (Panel A).

Discussion</title><p>SLNs are a category of versatile drug delivery systems that have been studied in the biomedical field for several years. One of the main reasons for the fast development of SLNs is their ability to effectively deliver both lipophilic and even smaller nanoparticles in such a way as to combine, as frequently reported in literature, therapeutic and diagnostic behavior. From an industrial point of view, other advantages can be found in the fact that their preparation often does not require organic solvents, that they can be easily sterilized and that the production of these lipid nanocarriers can be easily scaled up [<xref rid="B26-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In particular, the preparation of SLNs using the fatty acid coacervation technique (FACT), which allows the incorporation of drugs in a micellar solution of FA alkaline salts, does not require complex equipment and can be easily moved for industrial application [<xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This method is based on the slow interaction between a micellar solution of a sodium salt of a fatty acid and an acid solution (coacervation solution), in the presence of a proper amphiphilic polymeric stabilizing agent; the sudden lowering of pH causes SLN precipitation. Among the various fatty acids available, behenic acid was chosen as the lipid matrix, because, contrary to stearic and palmitic acid, it does not cause any detectable cytotoxicity in a number cell lines [<xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This method has been widely used to entrap both lipophilic anticancer agents (directly) and hydrophilic drugs, such as Dox, after the formation of hydrophobic ion pairs [<xref rid="B29-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To further improve stability, some Dox lipophilic prodrugs have recently been prepared and efficiently incorporated in SLNs [<xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The squalenoyl derivative used in this work is a rather singular lipophilic Dox prodrug, which has led to the formation of small-sized nanoassemblies, via the use of the solvent displacement technique and the squalenoylation approach, a strategy that has led to several active nanoassemblies being prepared and a variety of different agents being co-precipitated (theranostic approach) [<xref rid="B30-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These are soft structures that can be sensitive to a wide range of parameters, meaning that, in order to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo stability improvements in a squalenoyl derivative, it was necessary to efficiently entrap it in phospholipid vesicles (liposomes) [<xref rid="B32-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This approach, which combines the intrinsic properties and stability of SLNs with the potency of SQ-Dox, will, of course, be interesting for many, even if significant differences in drug loading must be taken into account for the following in vivo tests. </p><p>The hydrophobic core of SLNs can easily accommodate the Dox prodrug. The preparation procedure, which operates at a temperature that is kept slightly higher than the Krafft point of the chosen BA for a few seconds, does not degrade the prodrug structure and allows significant drug loading to occur. The incorporation of SQ-Dox into the SLN core has been proven by DSC, while size and structure have been confirmed by DLS and AFM analysis. Stability has been confirmed in water for all formulations (SLNs and SQ-Dox NAs). However, NAs showed significant aggregation under conditions resembling cell culture tests.</p><p>Activity on resistant ovarian cancer cells was higher for SQ-Dox than it was for Dox, which is similar to results published by Maksimenko et al., who reported in vitro and in vivo activity [<xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, an experiment on the same cell line, but which possessed induced resistance to Dox, highlights the role played by SLNs in more efficiently delivering SQ-Dox to resistant cells (clone). Hallmarks of apoptosis induction were performed in order to evaluate the apoptotic effect, caspase-3 activation and annexin-V levels of the treatments [<xref rid="B33-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Cells that had undergone early apoptosis were precisely tagged in the annexin-V test, which confirmed the earlier results of SQ-Dox&#x02019;s increased efficiency compared to the free drug, both in normal and resistant A2780 lines [<xref rid="B8-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>SQ-Dox appeared to be more active than other hydrophobic Dox prodrugs [<xref rid="B21-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but its improved activity and physical stability against resistant cell lines were more evident when it was incorporated into the SLN core. Moreover, association with lipidic carriers allows SQ-Dox to enter cells even with a low level of LDL receptor expression, as in the case of A2780 Dox-resistant cells [<xref rid="B34-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and to display significant anticancer efficacy. Indeed, squalenoyl derivative NAs have recently shown that they are preferentially uptaken by cancer cells with a high LDL-accumulating character, which results in higher activity [<xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nanomaterials-08-00110" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The observation that the inhibition detected in the clonogenic assay was substantially higher than that detected in the cytotoxicity assay suggests that cells, which were still viable after 72 h of treatment, were severely damaged and unable to proliferate in the clonogenic assay, which partially confirms the slow release of the Dox ester from SLNs. Our cell culture viability tests and apoptosis assays show that SQ-Dox NAs displayed antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects that are comparable to those of native Dox. This was proven with the high activity of apoptotic mediators, such as caspase-3 and, even more clearly, with annexin-V.</p><p>When all the results presented herein are taken as a whole, it appears clear that SQ-Dox SLNs can partially inhibit the proliferation of a resistant cell line by overcoming MDR, thanks to the fact that the entrapped drug is protected from the Pgp efflux mechanism of a cell. Nevertheless, further investigation into other resistant cancer cell lines, using a variety of LDL receptor expressions, is needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Ettore Bernardi for AFM measurements, to Konstantin Chegaev for generously providing daunorubicin intermediate, and to Dale JM Lawson for language correction.
