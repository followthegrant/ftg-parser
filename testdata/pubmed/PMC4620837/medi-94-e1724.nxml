Periodontal therapy improves endothelial function. It is not known if it is able also to improve the hemodynamics of the carotid artery. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of 2 different periodontal treatments on carotid hemodynamics: scaling and root planing (SRP) alone or together with low-level laser therapy (LLLT). Forty patients were recruited and randomly treated with SRP (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20) or SRP&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;LLLT (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20). Periodontal indices (plaque, gingival, and probing depth indices) were measured before and 5 months after treatment. Blood viscosity, common carotid wall shear stress, circumferential wall tension, and Peterson elastic modulus were evaluated before, soon after and 5 months after treatment. It was found that the periodontal indices improved in both groups, but significantly more so for SRP&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;LLLT than for SRP (decrease in gingival index 69.3% versus 45.4%, respectively, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04). In the SRP&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;LLLT group, after a transient reduction by 5% immediately after therapy, shear stress increased by 11% after 5 months. In SRP only group, however, shear stress variations were less marked. No significant changes were found for the other hemodynamic parameters in either of the groups. Periodontal disease treatment by SRP&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;LLLT can therefore be said to improve common carotid wall shear stress. This suggests a possible mechanism by which the treatment of periodontal disease has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The prevalence of cardiovascular events in patients with periodontal disease is higher than in the general population, probably because of some shared underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Periodontal inflammation is able to spread into systemic circulation, causing endothelial dysfunction and, finally, the development of atherosclerosis.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, periodontal disease has been found to be associated with low arterial wall shear stress,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> which is the frictional force exerted by the flowing blood on the endothelium; low values of this hemodynamic parameter alter arterial pathophysiology and cause endothelial dysfunction.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Another important hemodynamic factor influenced by periodontal disease is circumferential wall tension; very recently this has been found to be increased in large arteries, and this condition is also associated with the development of cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Intervention studies have demonstrated that periodontal treatment causes improvement of endothelial function, thus highlighting the link between periodontal health and cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>In recent years, therapeutic options in periodontal care have been enriched by photodynamic therapy. The low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is used increasingly as an adjunctive treatment to nonsurgical periodontal treatment because it seems to improve periodontal healing, and reduce gingival inflammation and the levels of local inflammatory biomarkers.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> To date, however, it is not known if an improvement in periodontal disease can influence arterial hemodynamics.

Before the study, the authors registered the protocol to the Committee that, evaluating local regulations, did not request any further registration.</p><p>The current research was a randomized, single-blinded, single-center intervention study. Participants were consecutively recruited between February and November 2013 among outpatients referred from their general practitioners to the Dental Unit of &#x0201c;Magna Graecia&#x0201d; University in Catanzaro (Italy) for periodontal disease. Inclusion criteria were age &#x0003e;18 and &#x0003c;70 years, and periodontitis lesions needing therapy based on a dentist's opinion. Exclusion criteria were potentially childbearing women, a history of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, clinically significant oncologic, renal, hepatic, or pulmonary disease.</p><p>Forty participants were recruited, and gave written informed consent. These participants provided a blood sample, and completed a clinical examination in the Metabolic Disease Unit of the same university. Medical history, pharmacological treatments, and smoking habits were recorded. All patients were then scheduled for both ultrasound evaluation for common carotid hemodynamic computation, and dental inspection to measure the periodontal indices (baseline visit). Afterward, patients were randomly assigned to receive either SRP only, or together with LLLT; periodontal therapy sessions were on one or more days, depending on disease extension and severity. Patients repeated the ultrasound examination 2 weeks (V2) and 20 weeks after therapy (V3). A measurement of periodontal indices was performed again at V3. Staff members who performed the vascular measurements were blinded with respect to the periodontal therapy applied.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical and Clinical Parameters</title><p>Blood was withdrawn from an antecubital vein after 12 hours fasting. Fasting blood lipids and glucose were measured using commercially available kits. Patients having fasting glucose &#x02265;126&#x0200a;mg/dL were invited to repeat the blood withdrawal. Height and weight were detected using standard methods, and body mass index was computed as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m<sup>2</sup>). Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was measured with a standardized sphygmomanometer on the right arm after the participant had rested for at least 5 minutes. The average of the second and third of 3 readings was computed. Mean blood pressure (MBP) was computed according to the formula: DBP&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;(SBP&#x0200a;&#x02212;&#x0200a;DBP)/3.

Therefore, 40 hemodynamic measurements were considered for each group. Internal diameter (ID) was defined as the distance between the leading edge of the echo produced by the intima&#x02013;lumen interface of the near wall, and the leading edge of the echo produced by the lumen&#x02013;intima interface of the far wall. Internal diameter was measured offline at the T and R wave of the electrocardiogram as, respectively, maximum and minimum diameter during the cardiac cycle; mean ID (ID<sub>M</sub>) was calculated as ID<sub>R</sub>&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;((ID<sub>T</sub>&#x0200a;&#x02212;&#x0200a;ID<sub>R</sub>)/3).

A periodontal probe (PCP/15 AIR, Henry Schein, Milan), with millimeter markings 1 to 15, measured the distance from the gingival margin to the base of the sulcus, or periodontal pocket, along the main axis of the tooth. The examiner calibrated his probing pressure between 10 and 20&#x0200a;g before each patient's examination. The depth of dental pockets was detected at 6 sites in each tooth (distofacial, facial, mesiofacial, distolingual, lingual, and mesiolingual).<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Pocket depth was scored as: 0 to 2&#x0200a;mm&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0; 2.1 to 4&#x0200a;mm&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1; 4.1 to 6&#x0200a;mm&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2; and &#x0003e;6&#x0200a;mm&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.

It was still not clear if wall shear stress is a modifiable risk factor for atherosclerosis, although the current data partially address this point by demonstrating that wall shear stress can be modified by periodontal therapy in an antiatherogenic way.</p><p>In fact, the medium-term direction of shear stress change by therapy is favorable, because in regions where low shear stress occurs, the atheroprotective genes are suppressed and the pro-atherogenic genes are upregulated, promoting the atherosclerotic process.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The entity of shear stress variation following periodontal healing is relevant, compared with the variations of the same parameter in diabetics, or those caused by aging. The percentage increase of mean shear stress observed in the current study, for example, is more than half of the difference that is observed between diabetics and healthy patients, and corresponds to a hemodynamic profile of approximately 9 years younger.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>Any arterial wall shear stress increase should imply important and positive consequences in terms of a possible reversion of the known association between periodontal disease and cardiovascular diseases. Probably, also, the previously described improvement in endothelial function after treatment of periodontal disease might, at least partially, rely on the hemodynamic improvement demonstrated in the current study.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Indeed, in a previous study, a strong relationship between baseline brachial artery wall shear stress and flow-mediated dilation has been reported.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>The worsening of common carotid hemodynamic features observed V2 is another original finding that needs to be discussed. It is about half of the long-term improvement, in absolute values; furthermore, it is transient. This result is in line with carotid shear stress reduction previously found in patients shortly after an extracorporeal circulation.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Similar to those previous findings, the current results might be because of a brief increase of the systemic release of inflammation molecules during treatment of periodontal disease.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>Apart from shear stress variations, the current study did not find any significant effect of the therapies on circumferential wall tension but, previously, it has been shown that periodontal inflammation is associated with increased parietal tension of the common carotid.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Probably, changes in the arterial features inherent to the vessel wall structure and mass are not pronounced enough to allow any perceivable positive effect to be recorded as far as 5 months after a periodontal intervention. Nonrecoverable damage to arterial walls because of periodontal diseases cannot be excluded, however.</p><p>There is currently no clear picture in respect to alterations in common carotid arterial stiffness because of periodontal disease, with one previous study reporting no such alterations but another demonstrating an elevated central arterial stiffness.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Looking at the current results, an effect on carotid stiffness because of treatment for periodontal disease can be ruled out, at least in the medium term.</p><p>The findings demonstrate that the increase in wall shear stress is much more pronounced in the SRP&#x0200a;<monospace>+</monospace>&#x0200a;LLLT group compared with the SRP only group. Because the SRP&#x0200a;<monospace>+</monospace>&#x0200a;LLLT group also shows a greater improvement in periodontal indices, it is not possible to determine, however, whether the increase in shear stress is induced by the most effective therapy or by use of the laser itself. Furthermore, specifically designed studies comparing SRP versus SRP&#x0200a;<monospace>+</monospace>&#x0200a;LLLT are needed, selecting patients with the same treatment responses.</p><p>The pathophysiological explanation of these findings is beyond the scope of the current study, although it might rely on the systemic low-grade inflammation characterizing periodontal disease. In fact, periodontal inflammation might reduce wall shear stress by an enlargement of the internal diameter of large arteries, as in rheumatoid arthritis.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Conversely, low shear stress might in turn also locally enhance vascular inflammation.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that oral pathogens as <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> can infect endothelial cells.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>LIMITATIONS</title><p>The current study has some limitations. First, the small number of enrolled patients, because of the complexity of vascular examinations. Second, the fact that inflammatory markers were not determined, which means that it is only possible to speculate about the mechanisms underlying the current results. Third, the arterial site chosen does not allow endothelial function studies to be performed locally. Finally, as in other studies using the present wall shear stress measurement method,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> a parabolic blood flow profile has been assumed for the common carotid; other measurement methods using computational flow dynamic reconstruction based upon magnetic resonance data,<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> overcome this assumption. In a clinical context, however, requiring repeated measurement of hemodynamic parameters through echo-Doppler use is probably advantageous compared with the expensive, time consuming, and complex magnetic resonance imaging techniques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The current study demonstrates a medium-term improvement in some carotid hemodynamic factors in patients undergoing a successful treatment for periodontal disease. This effect might be a mechanism by which the management of periodontal disease is beneficial for vascular function. Furthermore, larger studies are needed, also to confirm the mechanisms underlying these results and their pathophysiological implications.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: &#x003b7;n = blood viscosity, DBP = diastolic blood pressure, GI = gingival index, ID = arterial internal diameter, IDM = mean arterial internal diameter, IDR = diastolic arterial internal diameter, IDT = systolic arterial internal diameter, LLLT = low-level laser therapy, MBP = mean blood pressure, PD = pocket deep, PI = plaque index, SBP = systolic blood pressure, SRP = scaling and root planing, V1 = baseline visit, V2 = visit 2 weeks after therapy, V3 = visit 20 weeks after therapy, V<sub>M</sub> = mean velocity, V<sub>SP</sub> = systolic peak velocity.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hujoel</surname><given-names>PP</given-names></name><name><surname>Drangsholt</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Spiekerman</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
