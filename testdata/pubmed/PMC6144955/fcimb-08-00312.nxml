Different EHV1 strains circulating in the field have been characterized to be of abortigenic or neurovirulent phenotype. Both variants replicate in a plaque-wise manner in the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract (URT), where the abortigenic strains induce more prominent viral plaques, compared to the neurovirulent strains. Considering the differences in replication at the URT, we hypothesized that abortigenic strains may show an increased ability to modulate the type I IFN secretion/signaling pathway, compared to strains that display the neurovirulent phenotype. Here, we analyze IFN levels induced by abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 using primary respiratory epithelial cells (EREC) and respiratory mucosa <italic>ex vivo</italic> explants. Similar levels of IFN&#x003b1; (~70 U/ml) were detected in explants inoculated with both types of EHV1 strains from 48 to 72 hpi. Second, EREC and mucosa explants were treated with recombinant equine IFN&#x003b1; (rEqIFN&#x003b1;) or Ruxolitinib (Rux), an IFN signaling inhibitor, prior to and during inoculation with abortigenic or neurovirulent EHV1. Replication of both EHV1 variants was suppressed by rEqIFN&#x003b1;. Further, addition of Rux increased replication in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating an IFN-susceptibility for both variants. However, in two out of three horses, at a physiological concentration of 100 U/ml of rEqIFN&#x003b1;, an increase in abortigenic EHV1 replication was observed compared to 10 U/ml of rEqIFN&#x003b1;, which was not observed for the neurovirulent strains. Moreover, in the presence of Rux, the plaque size of the abortigenic variants remained unaltered, whereas the typically smaller viral plaques induced by the neurovirulent variants became larger. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of IFN&#x003b1; in the control of EHV1 replication in the URT for both abortigenic and neurovirulent variants. In addition, our findings support the speculation that abortigenic variants of EHV1 may have developed anti-IFN mechanisms that appear to be absent or less pronounced in neurovirulent EHV1 strains.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>equine herpesvirus 1</kwd><kwd>upper respiratory tract</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>type I interferon</kwd><kwd>phenotype</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003132</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">141627</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003130</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">11Y5415N</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="84"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="12548"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Every 24 h, 100,000 liters of air with potential pathogens pass through the respiratory system of an adult horse. Depending on the size of the pathogen particle, it can penetrate into the upper or lower respiratory tract (Derksen, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). A highly prevalent pathogen in horse populations worldwide that causes infection via the respiratory route is equine herpes virus 1 (EHV1). EHV1 is a member of the <italic>Varicellovirus</italic> genus in the <italic>Alphaherpesvirinae</italic> subfamily. The virus spreads via respiratory secretions during direct or indirect contact. EHV1 replicates in the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract (URT), causing mild respiratory problems. Via single infected local immune cells, EHV1 can penetrate through the basement membrane (BM), enter the blood stream and disseminate to the pregnant uterus or the central nervous system. Infected leukocytes may transmit virus to endothelial cells of the endometrial or central nervous system vasculature, resulting in thromboembolic disease and ischemia, causing neonatal foal death, late term abortion, or neurological disorders, such as hind limb ataxia (Edington et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Smith et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Smith, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; van der Meulen et al., <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Smith and Borchers, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Goehring et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Gryspeerdt et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Laval et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The occurrence of clinical symptoms has extensive economical consequences caused by treatment, biosafety, and quarantine procedures and interruption of training and competition times (Lunn et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Many horses become latently infected early in life and remain carriers of the virus (Kydd et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Slater et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>).</p><p>Different EHV1 strains circulating in the field have been characterized as abortigenic or neurovirulent phenotypes, based on a single nucleotide polymorphism in the catalytic subunit of the viral DNA polymerase (Nugent et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Lunn et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) demonstrated that the majority of equid herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) outbreaks are associated with the neurovirulent variants, whereas most abortions involved abortigenic strains. <italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies indicated that both EHV1 phenotypes replicate in a plaque-wise manner in the epithelium of the URT (Gryspeerdt et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Vandekerckhove et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Abortigenic variants replicate more efficiently in the URT, evidenced by a higher amount of larger viral plaques, whereas the neurovirulent strains infect local immune cells much earlier [24 h post inoculation (hpi)] in infection compared to abortigenic strains (36 hpi). This correlates with a cell-associated viremia earlier in infection, which might favor onset of neurological disease (Gryspeerdt et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Vandekerckhove et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Laval et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>As the initial exposure and primary viral replication occur in the epithelium of the URT, an effective innate immune response to EHV1 at this anatomical site is of key importance (Alberts et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). An overlying mucoprotein network, epithelial cell layers and their intercellular bridges form the first innate physical barrier, which complicates the attachment and invasion of pathogens into the epithelial cells (Vareille et al., <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Yang et al., <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Volsko, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Van Cleemput et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Moreover, these cells have the ability to secrete peptides, such as lactoferrins, defensins and nitric oxide, which have direct antimicrobial activities (Brandtzaeg, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Oppenheim et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Another key player in the host defense against viral infections of the URT is the interferon (IFN) system (Samuel, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). IFNs are secreted cytokines, which establish an antiviral state in cells (De Maeyer and De Maeyer-Guignard, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Three types of IFN (&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, &#x003bb;, and &#x003b3;) can be distinguished and bind to distinctive but related cell surface receptor complexes (de Weerd and Nguyen, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). During the first critical hours of a viral infection of respiratory epithelial cells, IFN&#x003b1;, -&#x003b2; (type I IFN), and IFN-&#x003bb; (type III IFN) are secreted and show similar antiviral activities via a highly similar signal transduction cascade. Type II IFN or IFN&#x003b3; binds to the IFNGR complex and is a key mediator of virus-specific cellular immunity (Sadler and Williams, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Conserved motifs within classes of potential pathogens are recognized through specific pathogen recognition receptors (PRR), such as toll-like receptors (TLR), expressed by professional immune cells and the majority of non-hematopoietic cells, including epithelial cells (McClure and Massari, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Airway epithelial cells express TLR1 to TLR6 and TLR9, which are located either in endosomes or at the external side of the cellular plasma membrane (Muir et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Platz et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Mayer et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Vareille et al., <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The activation of PRR triggers an intracellular pathway leading to the production and release of type I IFN from infected cells. IFN&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; (type I IFN) act similarly by binding in an autocrine or paracrine way to the heterodimer receptor IFNAR-1 and&#x02212;2. Once bound to their receptor, they signal via the Janus kinase (JAK) signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling cascade, to induce the transcription of hundreds of &#x0201c;IFN-stimulated genes&#x0201d; (ISG). The most important ISG-encoded proteins are the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), 2&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and RNase L, and Mx protein GTPases, which target several steps in the herpesvirus replication (Alberts et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Sadler and Williams, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Rentsch and Zimmer, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Schoggins and Rice, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; de Weerd and Nguyen, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>The early innate immune responses, guided by IFN, control the pathogen, and orchestrate the subsequent adaptive immune response against the invading pathogens. Many respiratory viruses, including alphaherpesviruses, have evolved multiple strategies to escape from the antiviral properties of IFN and persist in immuno-competent hosts by interfering with the IFN production, IFN signaling and/or the function of the IFN-induced expression of antiviral gene products (Cassady et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Poppers et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Yokota et al., <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Eidson et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Everly et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Lin R. et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Lin R. J. et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Brukman and Enquist, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Melchjorsen et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Hoffmann et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In recent years, studies indicated that a number of EHV1 proteins modulate the early immunity to EHV1 (Ambagala et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Van de Walle et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Wagner et al., <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Wimer et al., <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Sarkar et al. (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) demonstrated that the neurovirulent T953 strain shuts down IFN&#x003b2; production in equine endothelial cells upon the expression of late viral proteins. Primary respiratory epithelial cells inoculated with the neurotropic Ab4 strain showed an up-regulation of mRNA expression of IFN&#x003b1;, which indicates the activation of the IFN response in the URT (Soboll Hussey et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Intriguingly, recent studies of the URT demonstrated that chemokine expression varied between abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 strains <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> (Holz et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Zhao et al., <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). A careful analysis of the early IFN response against EHV1 at the URT, and a comparison between abortigenic and neurovirulent variants may contribute to our understanding of the invasion kinetics of the two types of EHV1 in the URT. Indeed, an appropriate IFN response is essential to overcome viremia and severe reproductive or neurological clinical signs caused by respiratory infections (Holz et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>Based on the phenotype-differences upon EHV1-replication and chemokine expression in the epithelium of the URT <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic>, we hypothesized that abortigenic EHV1 may trigger reduced amounts of IFN and/or display a decreased sensitivity to the antiviral effects of IFN on viral plaque formation at the level of the respiratory epithelium. In this work, we evaluated, by using an in-house developed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> model of the URT, the ability of abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 to activate the secretion of endogenous type I IFN. In addition, we analyzed whether both EHV1 phenotypes could overcome the antiviral state, induced by exogenous IFN&#x003b1;. Finally, we studied the effects of IFN&#x003b1; inhibition on replication kinetics of both EHV1 variants. Understanding the relation of both EHV1 phenotypes with IFN may have important consequences for the design of strategies to induce protective immunity and to develop new intranasal vaccination strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Virus</title><p>Different Belgian EHV1 strains were included in this study and were genotyped in the ORF30 region by the Animal Health Trust in the United Kingdom (Nugent et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).

Nasal and tracheal mucosa explants and EREC were (mock) inoculated with 1 ml of EHV1 97P70, 94P247, 03P37, or 95P105 strains containing 10<sup>6.5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> virus. At 10, 24, 48, and 72 hpi, the supernatants of mucosa explants were collected and explants were fixed. EREC and EREC-supernatants were collected at 10, 24, and 48 hpi. In the explants from the nasal septum, the number, and latitude of the viral plaques increased in time for both EHV1 phenotypes. At 72 hpi, we observed a trend of more and larger viral plaques induced by the abortigenic variants, compared to the neurovirulent strains, albeit the differences were not statistically significant. This corresponds with the observations described by Vandekerckhove et al. (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and Gryspeerdt et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In EHV1-inoculated tracheal mucosa explants, the abortigenic strains showed more plaques compared to the neurovirulent strains at 72 hpi. However, the difference in plaque latitude between the two phenotypes was less pronounced. In EHV1-inoculated EREC, no differences between the two types of strains could be observed. These results imply a tissue specific replication potential of EHV1. Next, viral replication was evaluated by virus titration of the supernatant (see Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">1C</xref>). Both abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 variants produced similar levels of new virus particles and no significant differences were observed between both types of variants. However, we detected slightly, but not significant higher virus titers in supernatant derived from tracheal mucosa explants, compared to nasal mucosa explants (<italic>p</italic> = 0.062). Taken together, mucosa explants and EREC are suitable models to investigate the role of IFN in respiratory EHV1 infections.</p><p>Therefore, the type I IFN production was concurrently analyzed in the URT after EHV1 infection. Equine IFN&#x003b1; concentration and bioactivity were assessed in the supernatants by ELISA and by a CPE reduction assay based on VSV and MDBK cells. Mucosa explants pre-treated during 18 h with rEqIFN&#x003b1; (100 U/ml) were used as positive control and were collected at 48 hpi. Determining the IFN&#x003b1; concentration in the supernatant of mucosa explants by ELISA, showed that all EHV1 strains triggered IFN&#x003b1; production starting from 48 hpi, compared to non-inoculated explants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, blue symbols). The IFN&#x003b1; concentration significantly increased from 48 to 72 hpi for all EHV1 strains (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in nasal and tracheal mucosa explants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, upper and middle panel). In addition, in EREC, IFN&#x003b1; was constitutively present at all time points, however no significant increase in time was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lower panel).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Type I IFN concentration (blue) and bioactivity (orange) in equine respiratory mucosa explants and equine respiratory epithelial cell (EREC) cultures.

Bioactive IFN&#x003b1; could be detected in the supernatant of EHV1 inoculated explants, while the IFN&#x003b1; bioactivity did not reach the limit of detection of 20 U/ml in mock-inoculated explants. Positive controls showed high IFN&#x003b1; bioactivity in nasal (556 &#x000b1; 166 U/ml) and tracheal (399 &#x000b1; 380 U/ml) mucosa explants (data not shown). Surprisingly, only nasal mucosa explants inoculated with the 97P70 abortigenic strain (33 &#x000b1; 14 U/ml) and 95P105 neurovirulent strain (20 &#x000b1; 2 U/ml), showed a low-level increase of IFN&#x003b1; bioactivity starting from 48 hpi (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, upper panel). In tracheal mucosa explants, similar levels (45 &#x000b1; 44 U/ml) of IFN&#x003b1; were detected for all strains at 48 hpi. From 48 to 72 hpi the IFN&#x003b1; expression increased to 100 &#x000b1; 109 U/ml for abortigenic 97P70 and 94P247 and 99 &#x000b1; 120 U/ml for the neurovirulent 03P37 and 95P105 strains. These results of tracheal mucosa explants correspond with the IFN&#x003b1; concentration determined by ELISA. In contrast, the IFN&#x003b1; concentrations in nasal mucosa explants detected by ELISA did not correspond with the measured IFN bioactivity. This suggests that not all IFN&#x003b1; secreted by nasal mucosa, is bioactive. Furthermore, bioactive IFN&#x003b1; secreted by EHV1-inoculated tracheal mucosa explants was significantly higher, compared to EHV1-inoculated nasal mucosa explants (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). These results imply that the production of IFN&#x003b1; in the nasal cavity is strictly regulated in order to orchestrate the beneficial and negative effects of IFN&#x003b1; in the host. Based on the results obtained by ELISA and by CPE-reduction assay we conclude that both abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 strains trigger IFN&#x003b1; production to the same level.</p><p>Finally, the expression of IFN&#x003b1; in mucosa explants was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) staining. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, constitutive expression of IFN&#x003b1; was observed in the basal part of respiratory epithelium in mock-inoculated nasal and tracheal mucosa explants at 48 hpi. In tracheal mucosa explants, secreted IFN&#x003b1; could also be observed at the apical side of the epithelium. Upon inoculation with abortigenic or neurovirulent EHV1 strains, the expression of IFN&#x003b1; co-localized with the EHV1 infected epithelial cells and was expressed in the apical and basal part of the respiratory epithelium, in contrast to control samples. No significant differences in IFN&#x003b1; expression or co-localization with infected epithelial cells were observed between the two types of EHV1 strains (data not shown). IF staining of EREC demonstrated a low-level constitutive expression of IFN&#x003b1; in non-inoculated EREC at 48 hpi.

Cell viability determined by TUNEL staining did not show any significant differences between rEqIFN&#x003b1; treated and non-treated mucosa explants or EREC (&#x0003e;95% TUNEL negative cells), suggesting that any inhibition of EHV1 was not the result of IFN-mediated cytotoxicity (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>).</p><p>In abortigenic EHV1-inoculated nasal mucosa explants, the number of plaques decreased from 8 &#x000b1; 1 of 97P70 plaques and 6 &#x000b1; 4 of 94P247 plaques at 0 U/ml to 4 &#x000b1; 3 and 2 &#x000b1; 1 at 100 U/ml, respectively.

A similar reduction was observed in tracheal mucosa explants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lower panel) and EREC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Nasal mucosa explants inoculated with the neurovirulent EHV1 strain 03P37 showed a decrease from 10 &#x000b1; 2 to 1 &#x000b1; 2 of plaques when rEqIFN&#x003b1; concentration increased from 0 to 1000 U/ml, respectively. A similar reduction was seen for the 95P105 strain from 4 &#x000b1; 1 to 1 &#x000b1; 1 of plaques with increasing rEqIFN&#x003b1; concentration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, upper panel). Analogous results were observed in tracheal mucosa explants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lower panel) and EREC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, a decrease in plaque latitude was observed in both respiratory mucosa explants and EREC with increasing rEqIFN&#x003b1; concentration. In nasal mucosa explants, plaque latitudes of 152 &#x000b1; 86 &#x003bc;m for 97P70 and 170 &#x000b1; 47 &#x003bc;m for 94P247 were measured at 0 U/ml rEqIFN&#x003b1;. This latitude decreased to 103 &#x000b1; 33 &#x003bc;m for 97P70 and 91 &#x000b1; 83 &#x003bc;m for 94P247 strains at 10 U/ml. However, at 100 U/ml an increase in plaque latitude was observed in two out of three horses for both 97P70 (132 &#x000b1; 52 &#x003bc;m) and 94P247 (89 &#x000b1; 43 &#x003bc;m) abortigenic strains, compared to 10 U/ml. At 1000 U/ml, plaque latitudes of 97P70 and 94P247 significantly dropped to 0 &#x000b1; 0 &#x003bc;m and to 14 &#x000b1; 24 &#x003bc;m, respectively (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, upper panel). Similar results were observed for tracheal mucosa explants and EREC inoculated with the abortigenic strains. Here, again, an increase in abortigenic EHV1 plaque latitude at 100 U/ml compared to 10 U/ml was seen for two out of three horses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, middle and lower panel). Similarly, plaque latitudes decreased for both neurovirulent strains from 119 &#x000b1; 51 &#x003bc;m to 0 &#x000b1; 0 &#x003bc;m for the 03P37 strain and 147 &#x000b1; 69 &#x003bc;m to 27 &#x000b1; 47 &#x003bc;m for 95P105 strain with increasing rEqIFN&#x003b1; concentration. In contrast to the abortigenic strains, the neurovirulent strains did not show a similar trend in plaque latitudes at a concentration of 100 U/ml when compared to 10 U/ml. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> shows representative confocal images of nasal mucosa explants, treated with 0, 10, 100, and 1000 U/ml of rEqIFN&#x003b1; prior to abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 infection. Next, we quantified EHV1 replication in the presence or absence of rEqIFN&#x003b1;, by determining extracellular virus titers by titration of the supernatants of inoculated respiratory mucosa explants and EREC at 48 hpi on RK-13 cells. We first demonstrated that rEqIFN&#x003b1; that may be present in the supernatants did not have a direct effect on EHV1 replication in RK-13 cells that were used for virus titrations (see Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">2</xref>). IFN-pretreated and EHV1-inoculated respiratory mucosa explants showed a concentration-dependent decrease in extracellular virus titers for both abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 variants. In addition, at 100 U/ml, for two out of three horses, the abortigenic 97P70 EHV1 strain showed a 2-log increase of virus titer, compared to 10 U/ml. And one out of three horses showed a 1-log virus titer increase for the 94P247 EHV1 strain at this concentration of IFN in tracheal mucosa explants. In general, this was not observed in either of the two EHV1 neurovirulent strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Although this increase was not statistical significant due to the large biological variation between the individual horses, it does seem to correspond with the increased plaque latitudes observed at 100 U/ml. At a high concentration of 1000 U/ml rEqIFN&#x003b1;, a significant lower virus titer was observed in nasal and tracheal mucosa explants compared to lower concentrations (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) for all EHV1 strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, upper and middle panel).

Explants remained in the presence of Rux or DMSO throughout the cultivation. Explants were collected and fixed at 48 hpi. Rux (or DMSO alone) did not affect cell viability in nasal mucosa explants (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2</xref>). Also, to determine whether Rux potentially could directly enhance EHV1 replication, independently from the IFN signaling pathway, a virus titration assay was performed on RK-13 cells in the presence or absence of the inhibitor. We found that Rux did not directly enhance EHV1 replication in RK-13 cells (see Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">3</xref>).

Both abortigenic EHV1 strains did not show a Rux-mediated increase in plaque latitude, compared to non-treated explants. Indeed, plaque latitudes of 97P70 and 94P247 did not show statistically significant differences at the concentration of 0.04 &#x003bc;M (167 &#x000b1; 51 and 154 &#x000b1; 35 &#x003bc;m) compared to non-treated explants (184 &#x000b1; 23 and 162 &#x000b1; 51 &#x003bc;m). Also, no concentration-dependent raise of plaque latitudes was present when Rux concentration increased to 0.4 &#x003bc;M (206 &#x000b1; 97 and 181 &#x000b1; 13 &#x003bc;m) and 4 &#x003bc;M (180 &#x000b1; 36 and 191 &#x000b1; 69 &#x003bc;m). However, Rux-treated explants inoculated with the neurovirulent EHV1 strains showed a dose-dependent increase in plaque latitudes, compared to non-treated explants. This indicates an enhanced lateral spread of the neurovirulent strains when the IFN signaling pathway is suppressed. Indeed, although the 03P37 and 95P105-inoculated mucosa explants showed no significant differences between 0.04 &#x003bc;M Rux-treated tissues (138 &#x000b1; 46 and 118 &#x000b1; 42 &#x003bc;m) and non-treated tissues (123 &#x000b1; 36 and 143 &#x000b1; 84 &#x003bc;m), plaque latitudes of 03P37 and 95P105 increased when Rux concentration increased from 0.04 to 0.4 &#x003bc;M (169 &#x000b1; 26 and 214 &#x000b1; 42 &#x003bc;m).

During the early stage of infection, the outcome of herpesvirus infections is dependent on the balance between virus spread and the initiation of innate immune responses, such as the IFN response (Melchjorsen et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Several studies already demonstrated that alphaherpesviruses have developed specific mechanisms to overcome the IFN response (H&#x000e4;rle et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Melchjorsen et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Johnson and Knipe, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), an important alphaherpesvirus in humans, has evolved many mechanisms to interfere with the IFN antiviral response. A few examples are the interference of ICP34.5 with the phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1;, and of US11 with OAS. EHV1 is a close relative of human varicella-zoster virus and HSV and is associated with symptoms varying from respiratory problems to neonatal foal disease, abortion and paralysis in <italic>Equidae</italic> (Frampton et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Remarkably, a recent increase in the incidence of equid herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) outbreaks has suggested a change in the virulence of the virus (Pusterla et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Lunn et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Wagner et al., <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The prevalence of EHV1-induced reproductive or neurological outbreaks is associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the catalytic subunit of the viral DNA polymerase (Nugent et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Goodman et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Interestingly, plaque sizes of abortigenic strains are significantly larger at 48 and 72 hpi compared to plaque sizes of neurovirulent strains, the same time points at which type I IFN secretion can be detected (Gryspeerdt et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Vandekerckhove et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The variations in primary replication observed between abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 variants may be explained by the differences in induction or susceptibility toward the antiviral effects of IFN.</p><p>First, we hypothesized that abortigenic EHV1 strains might be more efficient in down-regulating the synthesis of type I IFN in the epithelium of the URT, in contrast to the neurovirulent strains. In the current study, two abortigenic (97P70 and 94P247) and two neurovirulent (03P37 and 95P105) EHV1 strains were used. When evaluating the viral replication of the different EHV1 strains in mucosal explants and EREC, we observed viral plaques in the epithelium starting from 24 hpi, which increased in number and latitude over time. The observations in the nasal mucosa explants were consistent with previous <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies (Gryspeerdt et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Vandekerckhove et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The lateral spread and number of plaques in the epithelium was more pronounced when using the abortigenic variants, while neurovirulent strains induced less and smaller plaques, especially at 48 and 72 hpi. Interestingly, at both time points, we could detect an increased expression of IFN&#x003b1; for all EHV1 variants. An important finding is that abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 replication stimulated the secretion of IFN by the mucosal cells, suggesting no obvious interference of either viral variant with the induction of IFN in the URT. Moreover, the 97P70 and 94P247 abortigenic strains could induce the largest viral plaques in the presence of high IFN&#x003b1; concentrations. Both neurovirulent strains reached a replication plateau when IFN&#x003b1; was up-regulated. Similarly, in tracheal mucosa explants, we observed viral plaques starting from 24 hpi. Surprisingly, we observed more and larger viral plaques in the tracheal tissues, compared to the nasal mucosa, despite the presence of more IFN&#x003b1;. The higher number of larger viral plaques in tracheal mucosa explants can possibly be explained by the morphology of the tracheal mucosa. Integrity of the epithelial intercellular junctions (ICJ) progressively decreases from proximal to distal airways, which may benefit the virus to reach its receptor (Lopez-Souza et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Indeed, Van Cleemput et al. (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) recently showed that EHV1 more efficiently binds to tracheal mucosal explants, when compared to nasal septum mucosal explants due to receptor availability. Moreover, only upon a simultaneous destruction of the nasal septum's epithelial integrity and its mucoprotein network, EHV1 could bind efficiently to the explants. In addition, the actin-depolymerizing drug cytochalasin D enhances HSV1 release and spread upon disruption of cell polarity (Schelhaas, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). It can be postulated that, due to the different polarity of tracheal and nasal epithelial cells, the lateral spread of EHV1 differs in both tissues, which might explain the reduced strain variant-related differences in the tracheal mucosa. These results indicate that EHV1 replication is strain and tissue specific. In EREC, derived from tracheal mucosa, we could detect IFN&#x003b1; by IF staining, while ELISA or a CPE-reduction assay could not detect IFN&#x003b1;. As described for the mucosal explants, we observed high EHV1 replication in EREC, which might be due to the low IFN&#x003b1; concentration. In comparison with the tracheal mucosa explants, phenotype differences were less pronounced. Overall, the nasal mucosa is the primary site of EHV1 replication, and thus the most important tissue to analyze. This does not necessarily imply an enhanced EHV1-replication in the nasal tissues, but possibly indicates a better adaptation of the virus to specialized anti-viral proteins, such as type I IFN. In the present study, we demonstrated that both EHV1 phenotypes equally induce IFN&#x003b1; in the URT starting from 48 to 72 hpi. This is earlier in infection then observed in previous <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, where the IFN concentration in nasal secretions peaked at day 4 and day 7 pi (Bridges and Edington, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Edington et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Gryspeerdt et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). This can be clarified by the <italic>ex vivo</italic> explant model used in this study, in which the infection dose is much higher compared to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation. We could observe differences in IFN concentration and bioactivity between mucosae isolated from nasal septum and proximal trachea. In nasal mucosa explants, we observed high concentrations of IFN&#x003b1; by ELISA, while almost no bioactivity could be detected by the CPE reduction assay. IFN not only has beneficial protective effects on the host, but high concentrations or long-term exposure can induce side effects, such as nausea, fever, leukopenia and autoimmune disease (Gutterman, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). Therefore, to temper and regulate the immune response not all secreted IFN&#x003b1; may be bioactive in the nasal cavity. This observation has already been verified in many body fluids, such as serum, urine, saliva and peritoneal fluids, in which soluble type I IFN receptors modulate cytokine activity (Hardy et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Indeed, a soluble IFNAR can act as an antagonist of the IFN signaling in normal cells (Hardy et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; de Weerd et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). However, when incubating rEqIFN&#x003b1; with supernatant of nasal and tracheal mucosa explants, no indications were found for the presence of a soluble IFNAR (data not shown). The underlying mechanism for the low IFN&#x003b1; bioactivity in the nasal mucosa explants therefore remains unclear. Our results suggest that the induction of type I IFN is cell-type and virus strain specific. Indeed, in equine endothelial cells, derived from the pulmonary artery, the neurovirulent T953 EHV1 strain could induce type I IFN at early stages of infection (Sarkar et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Later in infection, this neurovirulent EHV1 strain could interfere with IFN transcription and translation. Other researchers have shown that both neurovirulent and abortigenic EHV1-inoculated PBMC could produce equal amounts of IFN (Wagner et al., <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). A study of Holz et al. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) reported differing IFN&#x003b1; levels in nasal secretions and cerebrospinal fluid of horses infected experimentally with the neurovirulent and abortigenic phenotype.</p><p>Since the epithelial cells inoculated with abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 showed no differences in the bioactive IFN&#x003b1; concentration, we hypothesized that there could be differences in sensitivity between both EHV1 variants upon the antiviral effects of IFN&#x003b1;. To assess the sensitivity of both EHV1 variants to the IFN-induced antiviral state, exogenous rEqIFN&#x003b1; (0, 10, 100, and 1000 U/ml) was added to our <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> model, 18 h prior to and during EHV1 inoculation. Here, we show that the replication of both abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 could be suppressed by the IFN-induced antiviral responses in the mucosa explants and EREC. Both immediate early and late viral proteins were similarly suppressed in the presence of rEqIFN&#x003b1; (data not shown). As the expression of late viral proteins is indicative of a full viral replication, only these proteins were further used in this study. Strong interferon responses in the URT might aid rapid clearance of the virus, which might explain the mild/subclinical respiratory disease <italic>in vivo</italic> (van Maanen, <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Gryspeerdt et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Both strain variants showed a reduction in the number of plaques in a rEqIFN&#x003b1; concentration-dependent manner, indicating that IFN&#x003b1; interferes with EHV1 replication in the epithelial cells of the URT. Which steps in viral replication are blocked is not known. Sainz and Halford (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) observed a similar inhibition of viral replication in Vero cells pretreated with type I IFN during an infection with HSV1. Viral replication was reduced by 20-fold to more than 1,000-fold when cells were pretreated with 100 U/ml of IFN&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b2;, respectively. The activation of the IFN-signaling pathway leads to the expression of hundreds of ISG (interferon-stimulated genes), which collectively target several steps of the virus life cycle (Schoggins and Rice, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Several alphaherpesviruses have evolved strategies to evade the IFN response, in order to create time to spread between adjacent cells such as epithelial cells, neurons and fibroblasts across cell junctions (Dingwell and Johnson, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Hukkanen et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Johnson et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Notably, we found indications for a concentration-dependent difference in plaque latitudes and virus titers between abortigenic and neurovirulent strains. When respiratory epithelium was pretreated with 100 U/ml prior to the abortigenic EHV1 infection, we observed an increased plaque latitude and virus titer, compared to the 10 U/ml. Due to the large biological variation between horses in this study, the increase in plaque latitudes and virus titer was not statistically significant at the concentration of 100 U/ml. Because the enhanced lateral spread of EHV1 was not observed with the neurovirulent variants during treatment with IFN&#x003b1;, this may indicate a variant-specific mechanism to interfere with the antiviral activity of IFN. This would imply that specific ISG-proteins do not suppress, but rather promote the lateral spread of the abortigenic variants at the physiological concentration between 10 and 100 U/ml of rEqIFN&#x003b1;. It is interesting that the indications for a potential pro-viral effect of IFN for the abortigenic strains were observed at a concentration of 100 U/ml, as this concentration corresponds with the IFN bioactivity detected in our <italic>ex vivo</italic> model and in the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments of Bridges and Edington (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>) and Gryspeerdt et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The exact mechanisms of action of the majority of the ISG-encoded proteins are poorly understood, making it difficult to explain a putative pro-viral effect. However, some ISG-effector proteins have been shown before to promote herpesvirus replication, independently of their anti-viral functions. Indeed, Speer et al. (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) observed a pro-viral effect of ISG15 in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and HSV1 infections, by destabilizing the IFNAR-complex the IFN signaling pathway is inhibited. Furthermore, glycoprotein B of HCMV is able to induce viperin, an ISG-protein, which binds to a mitochondrial thiolase to reduce the intracellular ATP concentration. This results in actin disruption and reduced ICJ integrity, which HCMV exploits for cell-to-cell spread (Seo et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Schneider et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Depending on the prevailing anti-viral or pro-viral effects, viral replication and spread is either suppressed or enhanced. This may help to explain the differences between abortigenic and neurovirulent strains observed in nasal mucosa explants. One speculative explanation could be that the abortigenic strains decrease the ICJ integrity in an IFN-concentration-dependent manner (100 U/ml) in the nasal mucosa via ISG-encoded proteins, while neurovirulent strains may be less efficient in this mechanism. Since the ICJ integrity of tracheal mucosa explants is physiologically reduced compared to that of the nasal mucosa, such an explanation may also fit in our observation of a more efficient lateral spread of both abortigenic and neurovirulent variants in trachea mucosa explants. When tissues are treated with high concentrations of IFN (1000 U/ml), the anti-viral effects rule over any pro-viral effects that IFN may have and inhibit the direct transfer of EHV1 from cell-to-cell. Current research is aimed at further examining the role of ISG in the lateral spread of EHV1.</p><p>The indications for differences in IFN-sensitivity between abortigenic and neurovirulent strains were confirmed by the use of an interferon signaling inhibitor, Ruxolitinib (Rux). Rux is a specific inhibitor of the JAK/STAT pathway, inhibiting Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) (Ganetsky, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Assi et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), thereby impairing the phosphorylation of STAT and further downstream signaling (Stewart et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gage et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Increasing the concentration of Rux led to the down-regulation of the IFN-induced antiviral effects without causing cellular cytotoxicity. The most obvious effect of Rux that was noted during the current study was an increase in the typically smaller plaque size of the neurovirulent strains in nasal mucosa explants as demonstrated <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by Vandekerckhove et al. (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and Gryspeerdt et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), respectively. Plaque sizes of the abortigenic strains, which are typically larger than those of neurovirulent strains, were not increased in the presence of Rux. This is in line with the effects of rEqIFN&#x003b1; on plaque size of abortigenic and neurovirulent strains. Indeed, together, these data strongly suggest that plaque formation by the abortigenic strains in nasal mucosa explants is less sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN compared to neurovirulent strains, suggesting that abortigenic strains have developed additional mechanisms to inhibit/exploit the IFN signaling pathway. In future research it will be of interest to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the different IFN evasion mechanisms of the abortigenic and the neurovirulent EHV1 variants.</p><p>Previous research demonstrated many differences between the abortigenic and neurovirulent strain variants, both at the primary site of replication and during cell-associated viremia. It will be interesting to determine the complete sequence of the strains to help identify possible causes of the observed phenotypic differences. During EHV1 infection of the URT, immune cells migrate into the airways to shut down viral replication. During a neurovirulent EHV1-infection of the URT, large amounts of immune cells mobilize into the respiratory mucosa and become infected with EHV1. These cells then may carry the virus to lymphoid tissues and the blood circulation, to reach the central nervous system. This is an explosive and precarious mechanism particularly displayed by neurovirulent variants, and in most of the infections, results in the elimination of the virus because of the massive mobilization of immune cells. However, the abortigenic strains recruit fewer leukocytes into the URT, which enables the virus to replicate in the respiratory epithelium to promote viral shedding. Occupant immune cells become infected with abortigenic EHV1 in a less explosive and more controlled manner, followed by a silent transport in these &#x0201c;Trojan horses&#x0201d; to the pregnant uterus (Vandekerckhove et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Laval et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Zhao et al., <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In general, our findings support the speculation that the abortigenic variants may have a selective advantage over the neurovirulent variants for long-term maintenance within the equine population, by mastering the antiviral effect of IFN at the URT (Nugent et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Goodman et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Vandekerckhove et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Laval et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Zhao et al., <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the present study is the first to provide a better understanding of the innate IFN response upon abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 infection at the respiratory mucosa surface. Using the <italic>ex vivo</italic> mucosa explant model, we were able to detect strong IFN&#x003b1; responses upon abortigenic and neurovirulent EHV1 infection. The enhanced replication of abortigenic EHV1, compared to replication of neurovirulent EHV1, at the physiological IFN&#x003b1; concentration, suggests that EHV1 abortigenic strains interfere more efficiently with innate immune responses of the host in the respiratory mucosae. In conclusion, an effective IFN response protects the horse to a moderate (abortigenic strains) or high (neurovirulent strains) extent against an EHV1 infection of the respiratory tract.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of The Belgian and European legislation, EU directive 2010/63/EU.
