Primary sensory areas are often viewed as necessary links between peripheral sensory information and decision centers, but multiple observations challenge this simplified model. For example, human subjects with primary visual cortex lesions display residual visual abilities, a phenomenon termed &#x0201c;blindsight&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sanders et&#x000a0;al., 1974</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). In animals, classical associative conditioning (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lashley, 1950</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">LeDoux et&#x000a0;al., 1984</xref>) or some operant behaviors (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hong et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>) based on sensory stimuli can be performed in the absence of primary sensory cortex. However, several studies also report sensory-based behaviors that are abolished or severely impaired by primary sensory cortex silencing (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Letzkus et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Connor et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Poort et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sachidhanandam et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). In addition, cortical stimulation experiments show that primary cortex for all sensory modalities can perturb perceptual decisions or initiate sensory-driven behaviors (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Choi et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Houweling and Brecht, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Huber et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Musall et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Connor et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Peng et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Salzman et&#x000a0;al., 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013</xref>), suggesting a role in perception. This apparent contradiction is particularly evident in hearing, for which involvement of auditory cortex (AC) is controversial even for discrimination of two distinct sounds. Indeed, lesions or reversible silencing of auditory cortex lead to deficits or have little effect, depending on task conditions, silencing methods, and animal models (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Diamond and Neff, 1957</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gimenez et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Harrington et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Jaramillo and Zador, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kuchibhotla et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Ohl et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Pai et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Rybalko et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Talwar et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). Thus, auditory cortex does not seem to be always necessary for sound discrimination.</p><p id="p0035">Moreover, the requirement of auditory cortex, in particular task&#x000a0;settings, points toward two alternative mechanistic implications. One alternative is that AC requirement reflects a permissive role for the task (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Otchy et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>), for example, by providing some global gating signals to other areas, which is not informative about the decision to be taken but without which&#x000a0;the behavioral decision process is impaired. The second alternative is that AC actually provides for each stimulus distinct pieces of information that contribute to drive the discriminative choices. Optogenetic manipulations of AC activity can modulate auditory discrimination performance (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aizenberg et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>), which could be both explained by a&#x000a0;permissive or a driving role of AC in the task. Targeted manipulation of AC outputs in the striatum can bias sound frequency discrimination toward the sound frequency corresponding to the preferred frequency of the manipulated neurons (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013</xref>). This indicates that AC output can be sufficient to drive discrimination, but as the effect of complete AC inactivation was not tested in this task, it remains possible that this manipulation does not reflect the natural drive occurring in the unperturbed behavior. In support of this, targeted manipulation of generic AC neurons failed to drive consistent biases in this task (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013</xref>). Thus, necessity and sufficiency of precise auditory cortex activity patterns in a sound discrimination behavior remain to be established.</p><p id="p0040">Here, we combine optogenetic silencing and patterned activation techniques in head-fixed mice to show that AC is not required in a simple frequency discrimination task but is necessary for a difficult discrimination involving sounds with frequency overlap. We also show, based on a discrimination of distinct optogenetically driven AC activity patterns, that specific AC information is sufficient for driving a discrimination, and decisions in this case also take longer than choices made in the simple task. Last, we show that focal stimulation of AC is able to modify the animal&#x02019;s choice in the difficult task, but not in the simple one. We also show that the AC region most sensitive to focal stimulation encodes auditory features used by the mouse to discriminate the two trained sounds. These results indicate that auditory cortex provides necessary and sufficient information to drive decisions in difficult sound discriminations, although other pathways bypass it in simple discriminations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Requirement of Auditory Cortex Depends on Sound Discrimination Complexity</title><p id="p0045">Lesion studies in gerbils, rats, cats, and monkeys (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Diamond and Neff, 1957</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Harrington et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Ohl et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Rybalko et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>) suggest that the involvement of auditory cortex in sound discrimination could be related to the sound features that have to be discriminated and thus potentially to the difficulty of the discrimination. To test this idea, we trained different groups of mice to perform a head-fixed Go/NoGo task: one group was trained to discriminate pure frequency features (a 4-kHz against a 16-kHz pure tone; PTvsPT task), and a second group had to integrate frequency variations over time in order to discriminate a linearly rising, frequency-modulated sound (4- to 12-kHz) against a pure tone (4-kHz; FMvsPT task; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). Although the PTvsPT task was rapidly learned, the FMvsPT task was more challenging, as it required much longer training (82&#x000a0;&#x000b1; 12 trials, n&#x000a0;= 34 mice for the PTvsPT against 416&#x000a0;&#x000b1; 54 trials, n&#x000a0;= 28 mice, for FMvsPT task to reach 80% performance; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; p&#x000a0;= 2.5&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1C). We thus wondered whether this difference in task difficulty could relate to differential involvement of AC. To address this question, we decided to silence AC by activating parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV) expressing channelrhodopsin2 (hChR2-tdTomato). Electrophysiological calibration in awake, passive mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) showed that this manipulation strongly disrupted cortical activity (e.g., <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B), decreasing population firing rates to target sounds by &#x0223c;70%, with about 50% of putative PV-negative neurons displaying a complete suppression of their response (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). To evaluate the effect of PV activation on task performance, we trained a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate the two target sounds based on the population activity of putative PV-negative neurons (n&#x000a0;= 125 neurons; recorded in 14 separate populations across 4 mice). We then measured the performance of the classifier with AC responses to the same sounds during PV activation. For the pure tones, the SVM performance dropped from almost perfect classification to less than 70%, and for the pure tone versus FM sound, SVM performance dropped to chance levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D), suggesting that the optogenetic manipulation perturbs sound encoding, although, given the small size of our neuronal sample, we cannot verify to what extent the information remains at a broader scale.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Discriminating a Frequency-Modulated Sound from a Pure Tone Is More Difficult Than Discriminating Two Distant Pure Tones</p><p>(A) Sketch of the head-fixed Go/NoGo discrimination task.</p><p>(B) Learning curves for all mice performing each task.</p><p>(C) Number of trials needed to reach 80% discrimination performance for PTvsPT and FMvsPT discrimination task (PTvsPT, n&#x000a0;= 34 mice; FMvsPT, n&#x000a0;= 28 mice; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; p&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 0.001).

However, the same manipulation during the PTvsPT task yielded less than a 10% performance drop (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>E), which is significantly lower than the &#x0223c;30% performance drop to chance level observed for the FMvsPT task (Wilcoxon rank sum test; p&#x000a0;= 0.002; n&#x000a0;= 6 and 7 mice). This mild impact was not due to the wide difference in frequency in our PTvsPT task, as mice were not more impaired by optogenetic AC silencing when discriminating 4-kHz versus 8-kHz or 4-kHz versus 6-kHz (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>), but we do not exclude AC involvement for even finer discriminations. Because the same inactivation strategy applied to the inferior colliculus, an earlier stage of the auditory system, fully abolished PTvsPT performance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>F), we suspected that the continued performance of the PTvsPT task after AC perturbation was not due&#x000a0;to incompleteness of the silencing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) but rather to the absence of AC involvement. We thus performed bilateral lesions that covered the entire AC and observed only a &#x0223c;10% drop in behavioral performance, even for a smaller frequency difference, on the day following lesion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>G and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>).

In this procedure, we observed that recorded single units tended to respond only to a subset of the tested locations (e.g., <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). Pooling together the activity of all recorded neurons, we observed that optogenetically and sound-triggered responses had similar latencies and time courses above a 50-ms timescale (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B; note that optogenetic responses followed the 20-Hz modulation of the light stimulus below the 50-ms timescale). Moreover, response amplitudes were similar in particular for the lowest light intensity tested (12 mW; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B), reflected by a high correlation of response amplitudes to the preferred sound and the optogenetic pattern (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D).

Alternatively, abnormal aspects of the optogenetic stimulation, such as weaker activation in deeper layers, may explain the long latencies. Interestingly, in the cortex-dependent auditory task (FMvsPT), discrimination times were also &#x0223c;400&#x000a0;ms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F), but contrary to direct cortical stimulation, discrimination was preceded by an early non-discriminative response whose onset timing was similar to the discriminative lick response in the PTvsPT task (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>F, arrowhead), which is likely a response to the 4-kHz frequency range, present at the onset of both S+ and S&#x02212; stimuli.</p><p id="p0075">These observations suggest that sound discrimination activates two pathways: (1) an AC-independent pathway producing an early response that can distinguish very distinct sounds but fails to discriminate more complex differences developing over time and (2) an AC-dependent, slower pathway that can provide specific information to improve the responses initiated by the AC-independent pathway, in case these fail to discriminate the proposed sounds, in particular when critical information arrives only after an ambiguous sound onset. In fact, AC is not required for discrimination of an FM sweep that starts at a frequency very distinct from the discriminated pure tone (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>), and in this case, non-discriminative licking at sound onset is weak, allowing short latency discrimination (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>). This suggests that what makes the discrimination difficult in our FMvsPT task is the necessity to ignore the non-informative sound onsets to make the correct decision.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Focal Auditory Cortex Stimulations Bias Decisions in the Complex Discrimination</title><p id="p0080">If indeed auditory cortex provides specific information to drive the correct decision exclusively in the difficult task, then specific activation of neural ensembles in AC should influence behavioral decisions in the FMvsPT task, but not in the PTvsPT task. To test this hypothesis, we trained two groups of Emx1-Cre &#x000d7; Ai27 to perform these tasks. For both groups, the non-rewarded stimulus (S&#x02212;) was the 4-kHz pure tone. The rewarded stimulus was the 16-kHz pure tone for one group and the 4- to 12-kHz FM sweep for the other group. After task acquisition, the right AC of each mouse was functionally mapped using intrinsic imaging to determine its tonotopic organization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A). Then, a grid of optogenetic stimulus locations (400-&#x003bc;m disks) was aligned to this map. Each location was stimulated during behavioral performance as occasional non-rewarded catch trials (10% occurrence) together with the non-rewarded 4-kHz pure tone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B). The purpose of this design was for the 4-kHz tone to drive the rapid non-specific response and test whether additional specific cortical drive mimics, at least partially, the perception of the rewarded stimulus instead of the presented S&#x02212;, thereby changing the late discriminative response. To mimic sound-induced activation as closely as possible with our method, we used the lower of our two calibrated light intensities (12 mW.mm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D). Unlike previous studies (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Connor et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013</xref>), these catch trials were not rewarded to measure a spontaneous interpretation of optogenetic perturbations by the brain and rule out reward-associated responses potentially generated by fast learning processes. Each of the 17 locations in the grid was tested across five catch trials, and the average lick count elicited was compared to the mean expected lick count distribution in five regular S&#x02212; trials to assess statistical significance (e.g., <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C; p&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 0.05). We accounted for multiple testing across the 17 locations using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. This conservative analysis showed that specific locations (e.g., <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>D) significantly increased lick counts above random fluctuations and brought the behavioral response close to the normal rewarded stimulus (S+) response for the FMvsPT task (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>E and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Moreover, the fraction of locations perturbing behavior was significantly above the false-positive rate across all animals tested (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>F). This was not the case for the easier PTvsPT task (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>F), in which no stimulus location could raise the lick count close to S+ level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>E and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Together, this experiment showed that targeted, physiologically realistic AC stimulation is sufficient to change the decisions of mice in the difficult auditory task, but not in the simple task, corroborating the idea that AC is not involved in the former but contributes decisive information in the latter. This idea was also reinforced by the observation that locations significantly perturbing behavior clustered around a specific area of AC when mapped across all animals in the FMvsPT task, but not in PTvsPT task (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>G and 5H).

This is in line with its contribution to the decisions in the FMvsPT task. We thus wondered whether the mid-frequency area of A1 is also involved in coding the 4- to 12-kHz FM sweep. First, we observed that strong intrinsic imaging responses to the FM sweep occur in A1, particularly in the mid-frequency area (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A). To better quantify the information contained in this area, we performed two-photon calcium imaging in layer 2/3 of AC in awake, passively listening mice who had been injected with pAAV1.Syn.GCaMP6s virus. All imaged fields were aligned to intrinsic imaging maps using blood vessel patterns (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B), allowing a comparison of micro- and mesoscale maps. Color coding cell locations with respect to their best frequency, we qualitatively observed a good match between tonotopic maps derived from the intrinsic and calcium imaging (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>), even if a certain level of disorganization could be seen in the high-resolution map as reported previously (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bandyopadhyay et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rothschild et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). For example, the mid-frequency area identified with intrinsic imaging mostly contained cells with best frequencies at 8- or 16-kHz when imaged at high resolution (e.g., <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>). Based on these data, we calculated the similarity (correlation coefficient) between population responses to FM sweeps and to different pure tones and found, both at coarse and high spatial resolution, that the response to the FM sweeps is most similar to the responses to pure tones around 8-kHz (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>D). We reasoned that neurons coding for this frequency range in A1 could be particularly important for discriminating the FM sweep from the 4-kHz tone. To quantify this idea with our two-photon calcium imaging measurements, we calculated the fraction of neurons responding to different pure tones within the population that responds to the FM sweep,&#x000a0;but not to the 4-kHz pure tone (discriminative FM sweep neurons). This showed that neurons that discriminatively respond to the FM sweep indeed have a preference for frequencies around 8-kHz (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>E), a result in line with the localization of the most disruptive optogenetic perturbations in the mid-frequency region of A1, at least if AC representations are similar in passive and active mice.</p><p id="p0090">To evaluate whether context-dependent changes (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Francis et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kuchibhotla et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>) could impact our conclusions, we also performed calcium imaging in mice engaged in the FMvsPT task. We found, as previously reported, positive and negative modulations (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kuchibhotla et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>) for a fraction&#x000a0;of neural responses during engagement, which averaged to a net&#x000a0;decrease of population responsiveness (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>). However, AC population activity classifiers trained in the passive state maintained good performance in discriminating the sounds when tested in the active state (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>), confirming the overall similarity of active and passive sound representations in AC.</p><p id="p0095">Thus, together, our optogenetic and imaging experiments suggest that AC contributes to the discrimination of the 4- to 12-kHz sweep versus 4-kHz pure tone by engaging spatially segregated neurons that preferentially code for intermediate frequencies around 8-kHz. A prediction of this model is that mice engaged in the FMvsPT discrimination should strongly associate the 4- to 12-kHz sweep with pure tones in the 8-kHz frequency range. To test this prediction, we presented pure tones in occasional non-rewarded catch trials during the task and measured the licking responses of the mouse (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>A). We observed that&#x000a0;mice responded to 5.6-kHz and 8-kHz non-rewarded pure tones with a number of licks similar to the lick count observed after the rewarded 4- to 12-kHz sweep (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>B), revealing the expected association of these frequencies with the FM sound. We thus wondered whether this categorization behavior crucially depends on neurons sensitive to frequencies in the 8-kHz region. We trained a linear classifier (SVM) to discriminate the 4- to 12-kHz sweep and the 4-kHz pure tone based on the&#x000a0;responses of neurons imaged in passive mice and significantly activated by only one of the two sounds (discriminative neurons). When testing this classifier with the single-trial population responses elicited by pure tones, we could qualitatively reproduce the categorization curves observed during behavior (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>B). This indicates a match between the structure of the coding space in AC and of the perceptual space as probed in the FMvsPT behavioral task. However, when the classifier was trained without the neurons that significantly respond to the 8-kHz pure tone, then no match was observed between behavioral and cortical categorization curves, although the remaining neurons still discriminate the FM sweep from the 4-kHz pure tone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>B). This result corroborates the idea that activation of neurons responding in the 8-kHz frequency range critically contributes to the identification of the FM sweep&#x000a0;against the 4-kHz tone, in line with the observation that focal optogenetic stimulation in the region most sensitive to the mid-frequency ranges promotes licking responses associated with the FM sweep (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>H).<fig id="fig7"><label>Figure&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>Mice Use Intermediate Frequencies as a Cue to Discriminate between FM Sweeps and Low-Frequency Pure Tones</p><p>(A) Sketch of the auditory categorization assay.</p><p>(B) Mean response probabilities in response to unrewarded pure tones occasionally replacing trained stimuli in the FMvsPT discrimination task (mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1; SEM; n&#x000a0;= 6 mice).

Here, the more complex task involves two sounds that overlap in frequency at their onset but then diverge due to upward frequency modulation for one of them. The two sounds are thus theoretically distinguishable thanks to both spectral (mid- and high frequencies of the FM sound) and temporal (continuous frequency variations) cues. It is striking that, despite the large spectral differences between the two sounds of the FMsPT task, this discrimination was much harder for mice to learn than the pure tone discrimination task. The challenge likely comes from the frequency overlap at the beginning of the two sounds, as suggested by the lack of AC involvement when the FM sweep starts from a frequency very different from the pure tone (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). This spectral overlap implies that both sounds activate a large group of identical neurons throughout the auditory pathway, as we observe in&#x000a0;the auditory cortex (the FM sweep also activates the 4-kHz region; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Activation of the set of neurons coding for the overlapping frequency is a strong and early predictor of rewards in S+ trials. Therefore, a simple reinforcement learning rule might associate activity of these neurons to the licking response, which makes it difficult for the animal to refrain from licking in S&#x02212; trials, in which the same neurons are active. The challenge for the brain might be to use information from the subsequent, non-overlapping parts of the sound representations to counteract such generalization. Analysis of the licking profiles in the FMvsPT task indicates that mice do not fully resolve this problem. Indeed, their initial response both to S&#x02212; and S+ is to lick shortly after sound onset. It is only after this initial&#x000a0;impulse that modulation of licking leads to the discriminative response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>F). The role of auditory cortex might be to solve this initial confound, although alternative pathways are able to learn the correct associations when discriminated stimuli&#x000a0;are encoded with little overlap, as expected for the distant pure tones of the PTvsPT task. Corroborating this explanation, when the direction of the FM sweep is reversed (12- to&#x02013;4-kHz), thereby removing the initial frequency overlap, discrimination with the 4-kHz pure tone is much less sensitive to AC lesions (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>), and discrimination time is similar to the PTvsPT task (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>). Interestingly, a similar phenomenon is observed in a Pavlovian discriminative fear condition protocol, in which conditioning to a specific direction of frequency ramps cannot be achieved without AC, although AC is dispensable for fear conditioning to a specific pure tone (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Dalmay et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref> [in this issue of <italic>Neuron</italic>]). Thus, the requirement of auditory cortical areas for distinguishing temporal variations in frequency overlapping stimuli might be a generic principle independent of the sound association protocol used to uncover it (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Diamond and Neff, 1957</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Harrington et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Ohl et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>), with possible hemispheric specializations, as pointed out by a previous study (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wetzel et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="p0105">Our study does not identify the alternative pathways that provide auditory information to motor centers in the absence of AC&#x000a0;in the simple PTvsPT task. Connectivity studies suggest multiple connections between the auditory system and motor-related centers (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Pai et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Primary auditory thalamus is known to project to striatum (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">LeDoux et&#x000a0;al., 1991</xref>), a brain region necessary for appetitive sound discrimination tasks (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Guo et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Thalamo-striatal projections could possibly implement the main sensory-motor association in the easy task (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gimenez et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Guo et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Sensory-motor associations are also possible at the mid-brain level, where inferior colliculus contacts superior colliculus, which in turn projects to several motor centers (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stein and Stanford, 2008</xref>). The strong impact of optogenetic silencing of the inferior colliculus on the PTvsPT discrimination suggests that the sensory-motor association does not occur at brainstem level before information reaches colliculus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A), although further investigation would be necessary to verify that our colliculus-silencing experiment does not uncover a permissive effect of colliculus in the task (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Otchy et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, thalamic silencing was shown to strongly impact frequency discrimination (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gimenez et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that the sensory-motor association in our PTvsPT task does not occur before auditory information reaches thalamus. Finally, another possibility is that decisions in the PTvsPT task are driven by alternative cortical routes excluding auditory cortex but receiving auditory information from primary or secondary thalamus. Such direct pathways, for example, to more associative areas, have been proposed to support blindsight abilities in patients lacking primary visual cortex (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cowey, 2010</xref>). In line with this possibility, recent results indicate that fear conditioning to simple sounds does not require auditory cortex but requires the neighboring temporal association area (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Dalmay et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Also, recordings in prefrontal cortex during an auditory discrimination task show the presence of fast responses to sounds (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fritz et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), compatible with a direct pathway. Similarly, in our task, bypass pathways to temporal or prefrontal associative areas could eventually be sufficient to make simple auditory decisions, even in absence of auditory cortex.</p><p id="p0110">Independent of the identity of the alternative pathway involved&#x000a0;in the PTvsPT, our results suggest that it provides a faster route to generate motor responses than the route that involves auditory cortex. This idea derives from the long discrimination times (&#x0223c;400&#x000a0;ms) observed when mice discriminate two optogenetically driven cortical activity patterns as compared to the short discrimination times (&#x0223c;150&#x000a0;ms) observed for the PTvsPT task (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F). This long discrimination time is unlikely to result from difficulties in differentiating the two optogenetic stimuli, as detection of one stimulus required also &#x0223c;400&#x000a0;ms independent of stimulus strength and size (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>), consistent with previous measurements in another optogenetic stimulus detection task (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Huber et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Some electrical microstimulation experiments report shorter reaction times in behavior (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Houweling and Brecht, 2008</xref>). This could be due to the weaker drive elicited by optogenetics in deeper layers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>F and 3G). Alternatively, microstimulation can directly activate principal neurons in subcortical areas by antidromic propagation, which does not occur in optogenetics due to specificity of expression and less efficient activation of antidromic spikes (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Tye&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Antidromic activations could recruit pathways faster than those activated by cortex alone. Calibration of our optogenetic stimuli also showed that the two chosen stimulus locations can be efficiently discriminated based on triggered cortical activity within 50 to 100&#x000a0;ms (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>). However, although population firing rate and spatial extent parameters of&#x000a0;optogenetic stimuli were similar to sound responses in AC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>), we cannot fully rule out that some non-controlled parameters of the artificial stimulations lead to extended reaction times. It is also possible that absence of subcortical drive in the optogenetic task leads to threshold effects that slow down the behavioral response. Yet, in support of a slow sensory cortical pathway, discrimination times observed in cortex-dependent sensory discrimination tasks in head-fixed mice using visual or tactile cues are typically above 300&#x02013;400&#x000a0;ms (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Connor et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Poort et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sachidhanandam et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). In the cortex-dependent auditory task presented in our study (FMvsPT), discrimination times are also long (&#x0223c;350&#x000a0;ms; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F). We measured that AC activity starts to be discriminative for the FM sweep and 4-kHz pure tone only about 100&#x02013;150&#x000a0;ms after sound onset&#x000a0;although two pure tones are discriminated by AC activity already 50&#x000a0;ms after onset (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). This leaves a supplementary delay between information arrival and decision of at least 100&#x000a0;ms in the cortex-dependent FMvsPT task as compared to the cortex-independent PTvsPT task. This delay could be due to complex multisynaptic pathways downstream to AC (e.g., including associative cortical areas) or to downstream temporal integration processes. Timing differences could also play a role in the absence of AC engagement in simple tasks. Indeed, although AC rapidly receives auditory information (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D), its slow impact on behavior could allow alternative pathways that provide faster responses to short-circuit information coming from AC, which would be ignored by decision areas. It is also possible that alternative pathways inhibit AC output when they provide a solution to the task.</p><p id="p0115">This might explain the absence of strong perturbations of the&#x000a0;easy PTvsPT task when we applied non-rewarded focal stimulations of AC, calibrated to typical sound response levels, despite specific targeting to the tonotopic fields relevant for the discrimination. We do not exclude that rewarding licking responses to the occasional focal stimulations could rapidly lead, after some learning, to a reinforced participation of stimulated cortical areas in behavioral decisions.</p><p id="p0120">In the case of the harder FMvsPT task, focal stimulations had a significant effect on behavior, despite the absence of rewards in our protocol. This indicates that, despite the coarseness of the stimulation approach that globally targets heterogeneous cell ensembles enriched with particular spectral information due to tonotopic organization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>), some optogenetically driven ensembles activate large enough parts of the stimulus representations to change behavioral decisions. Thus, our results demonstrate that manipulation of auditory cortex representations impact perception, at least, if the behavioral task for perceptual readout is appropriately chosen. This opens interesting possibilities for central auditory rehabilitation techniques. In the FMvsPT task, we took advantage of the fact that spectral cues can be used to distinguish the two auditory stimuli, such that neural ensembles relevant for discrimination in AC tend to be clustered in space and can be activated with broad light patterns, while minimizing activation of cell types carrying confounding information. However, spatial organization is not absolutely strict in mouse auditory cortex (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bandyopadhyay et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rothschild et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), especially for more complex features, including temporal modulations (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Deneux et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kuchibhotla and Bathellier, 2018</xref>). Thus, fine-scale stimulation methods (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Packer et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) implemented at a sufficiently large&#x000a0;scale would be necessary to precisely interfere at AC level with the discrimination of sounds that only differ based on complex, non-spectral features and thereby eventually construct more precise artificial auditory perceptions.</p><p id="p0125">The fact that the AC pathway is dispensable for simple discriminations suggests that auditory judgments, and potentially perception, result from the interplay between a coarse description of sensory inputs and a time-integrated, more elaborate description that involves auditory cortex. As we showed by attempting to drive auditory judgments directly at the cortical level&#x000a0;(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>), the coexistence of these pathways is a critical issue to manipulate auditory perception. It might thus be advantageous to combine stimulations of cortical and subcortical (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Guo&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) levels in order to improve the quality of artificially generated perception in the central auditory system.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>STAR&#x02605;Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Key Resources Table</title><p id="p0130"><table-wrap position="float" id="undtbl1"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>REAGENT or RESOURCE</th><th>SOURCE</th><th>IDENTIFIER</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><bold>Antibodies</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td>Anti-NeuN alexa fluor 488 conjugated</td><td>Merk</td><td>MAB377X // RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="nif-antibody:AB_2149209" id="intref0010">AB_2149209</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><bold>Bacterial and Virus Strains</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td>pAAV1.Syn.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40</td><td>Vector Core &#x02013; University of Pennsylvania</td><td>Cat#: AV-1- PV2824 // RRID:Addgene_100843</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><bold>Experimental Models: Organisms/Strains</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td>PV-Cre Mouse B6;129P2-Pvalbtm1(cre)Arbr/J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>JAX: 008069 // RRID:IMSR_JAX:008069</td></tr><tr><td>Ai 27 Mouse: B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm27.1(CAG-COP4<sup>&#x02217;</sup>H134R/tdTomato)Hze/J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>JAX: 012567 // RRID:IMSR_JAX:012567</td></tr><tr><td>Emx1-Cre Mouse B6.129S2-Emx1tm1(cre)Krj/J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>JAX: 005628 // RRID:IMSR_JAX:005628</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><bold>Software and Algorithms</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td>AutoCell</td><td><xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Roland et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/thomasdeneux/autocell" id="intref0015">https://github.com/thomasdeneux/autocell</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Klusta spike sorting</td><td>CortexLab (UCL)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kwikteam/klusta" id="intref0020">https://github.com/kwikteam/klusta</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Lead Contact and Materials Availability</title><p id="p0135">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Brice Bathellier (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="mailto:brice.bathellier@cnrs.fr" id="intref0025">brice.bathellier@cnrs.fr</ext-link>).

In all experiments, young adult females and males between 8 to 16&#x000a0;weeks old were used. Animals were housed 1&#x02013;4 animals per cage, in normal light/dark cycle (12 h/12 h).

Sadoc, UNIC, France) coupled to a National Instruments card (PCIe-6351). Sounds were amplified (SA1 Stereo power amp, Tucker-Davis Technologies) and delivered through high frequency loudspeakers (MF1-S, Tucker-Davis Technologies) in a pseudo-random sequence. Water delivery (5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) was controlled with a solenoid valve (LVM10R1-6B-1-Q, SMC). A voltage of 5V was applied through an electric circuit joining the lick tube and aluminum foil on which the mouse was sitting, so that lick events could be monitored by measuring voltage through a series resistor in this circuit (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>F). Before starting the training procedure, mice were water restricted for two consecutive days. The first day of training consisted of a habituation period for head fixation and to reliably receive water by licking the lick port without any sound. After this period, S+ training was conducted for 2 or 3&#x000a0;days where S+ trials were presented with 80%&#x02013;90% probability, while the remaining trials were blank trials (no stimulus). A trial consisted of a random inter-trial interval (ITI) between 6 and 8&#x000a0;s to avoid prediction of stimulus appearance, a random &#x02018;no lick&#x02019; period between 3 and 5&#x000a0;s and a fixed response window of 1.5&#x000a0;s. Licking during the response window on an S+ trial above lick threshold (3-5 consecutive licks) was scored as a &#x02018;hit&#x02019; and triggered immediate water delivery. No licks was scored as a &#x02018;miss&#x02019; and the next trial immediately followed. Each behavioral session contained &#x0223c;150 rewarded trials allowing mice to obtain their daily water supply of &#x0223c;800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l. At the beginning of each session, &#x0223c;20 trials with &#x02018;free rewards&#x02019; were given independent of licking to motivate the mice. When animals reached more than 80% &#x02018;hits&#x02019; for the S+ stimulus, the second sound (S-) was introduced, and the lick count threshold was set to 5 licks (in a few PTvsPT experiments, only 3 licks). During presentation of the S- sound, licking below threshold was considered as a &#x02018;correct rejection&#x02019; (CR) and the next trial immediately followed, licking above threshold on S- trials was considered as a &#x02018;false alarm&#x02019; (FA), no water reward was given, and the animal was punished with a random time out period between 5 and 7 s. Each session then contained 300 trials with 50% probability for each trial type. Sounds of 0.2&#x000a0;s at 60 dB were used for the PT versus PT tasks and sounds of 0.5&#x000a0;s at 70 dB SPL for the FMvsPT tasks. During the entire behavioral training period, food was available <italic>ad libitum</italic> and animal weight was monitored daily. Water restriction (0.8mL/day) was interleaved with a 12h <italic>ad libitum</italic> supply overnight every Friday. Mice performed behavior five days per week (Monday to Friday).

The licking signal for each stimulus was binned in 10&#x000a0;ms bins, and for every time bin, we used the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test to obtain the p value for the null hypothesis that the licking signal was coming from the same distribution for S+ and S-.

Surgery was performed in 4 to 6&#x000a0;week old mice placed on a thermal blanket under anesthesia using a mix of ketamine (Ketasol) and medetomidine (Domitor) (antagonized with atipamezole - Antisedan, Orion pharma &#x02013; at the end of the surgery). The eyes were covered using Ocry gel (TVM Lab) and Xylocaine 20mg/ml (Aspen Pharma) was injected locally at the site where the incision was made. The right masseter was partially removed and a large craniotomy (&#x0223c;5&#x000a0;mm diameter) was performed above the auditory cortex (AC) using bone sutures of the skull as a landmark. For 2P calcium imaging, we did 3 to 5 injections (&#x0223c;300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m separation) of 200nL (35 nl/min) using pulled glass pipettes of rAAV1.syn.GCamP6s.WPRE virus (10<sup>13</sup> virus particles per ml) diluted 10 times (Vector Core, Philadelphia, PA, USA). After this, the craniotomy was immediately sealed with a 5&#x000a0;mm circular coverslip using cyanolite glue and dental cement (Ortho-Jet, Lang). For AC inactivation experiments with optogenetics, the same procedure was repeated on both brain hemispheres in a single surgery. For inferior colliculus inactivation experiments, the 5mm cranial window was placed on the midline such that it covered the dorsal part of both hemispheres of the inferior colliculus. In all cases, mice were subsequently housed for at least one week without any manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4.4"><title>Optogenetics inactivation of AC during behavior</title><p id="p0160">For optogenetic inactivation experiments, mice were first trained to respond to the S+ stimulus alone (see Behavior), then when the S-&#x000a0;stimulus was introduced for discrimination training, a pair of blue LEDs (1.1W, PowerStar OSLON Square 1+, ILS, wavelength 455nm) was placed 2&#x000a0;cm above their head, facing each other at 1&#x000a0;cm distance, and were flashed 1 over 5 trials for visual habituation of the animal to light flashes (initially inhibiting licking). When discrimination performance was above 80% and similar both with and without light flashes, one to three test sessions were performed in which the LEDs were either placed on the bilateral AC cranial windows, or on the inferior colliculus window (1 LED only). Stimulus presentation was pseudo-randomized over blocks of 100 trials and light flashes appeared in 1 out of 5 trials for each stimulus with the same reward or punishment conditions as regular trials. Blue light delivery followed a square wave (20Hz) time course and started 100ms before onset lasting for 700ms (sound duration was no longer than 500ms). Light intensity at the brain surface was measured to be 36&#x000a0;mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. Discrimination performance was computed as the number of hits and correct rejections over the total number of trials, separating trials in which the LED was turned ON or OFF.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4.5"><title>Patterned optogenetics during behavior</title><p id="p0165">For patterned optogenetic activation in the mouse AC, we used a LED-based video projector (DLP LightCrafter, Texas Instruments) tuned at 460&#x000a0;nm. To project a two-dimensional image onto the auditory cortex surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), the image of the micromirror chip was collimated through a 150&#x000a0;mm cylindrical lens (Thorlabs, diameter: 2 inches) and focused through a 50&#x000a0;mm objective (NIKKOR, Nikon). Light collected by the objective passes through a dichroic beam splitter (long pass, &#x0003e; 640nm, FF640-FDi01, Semrock) and is collected by a CCD camera (GC651MP, Smartek Vision) equipped with a 50&#x000a0;mm objective (Fujinon, HF50HA-1B, Fujifilm). For discrimination of artificial AC patterns, two disks of 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m were placed at two different locations in AC. The first disk was defined as the S+ stimulus and systematically located at the center of the low frequency domain in A1. The second disk, defined as the S-&#x000a0;stimulus was placed at the center of the high frequency domain in the UF obtained with intrinsic imaging (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>, see <xref rid="sec4.4.9" ref-type="sec">Intrinsic imaging and alignment of tonotopic maps across animals</xref> below). Alignment of optogenetic stimulus locations across days was done using blood vessel patterns at the surface of the brain with a custom made GUI in MATLAB. In short, a reference blood vessel image was taken at the beginning of the experiment. In subsequent days, a new blood vessel image was taken and aligned to the reference image by optimizing the image cross- correlation to obtain the appropriate rotation and translation matrix. Behavioral training with optogenetic stimuli was done with the same protocol as for sounds.</p><p id="p0170">For focal AC activation during sound discriminations, a grid of 15 to 17 locations was constructed using disks of &#x0223c;400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m distributed in 5 rows.

Each grid was constructed to maximize the coverage of the different frequency domains and tonotopic subfields seen in intrinsic imaging (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>). To probe responses to optogenetic perturbation during discrimination behavior we performed test sessions of 300 pseudo-randomized trials in which 45 to 54 trials were non-rewarded catch trials with stimulation of a grid location together with the S- sound. Sound (4 kHz, 500&#x000a0;ms at 70 dB SPL) and light (12&#x000a0;mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, 1&#x000a0;s duration, square wave intensity profile at 20&#x000a0;Hz) started at the same time. Responses to focal optogenetic perturbations were computed over 3 catch trial repetitions. The significance of these responses was assessed by computing the distribution of lick count responses over 10,000 random triplets of responses to S- alone. The p value of the response to a particular optogenetic stimulation location was taken as the percentile of this distribution corresponding to the trial-averaged lick count for the optogenetic stimulation. Based on the p values computed for all grid locations, we performed a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing to identify the locations with a significant response at a false positive rate of 0.05. For display, lick count responses (L) to optogenetic perturbations were normalized for each mouse as (L-s-)/(s+ - s-), where s+ and s- are the mean lick counts observed for S+ and S- stimuli. Maps of response to optogenetic perturbation were aligned across different mice, by matching the grid locations placed on the 4 kHz landmarks, calculating the best rotation and translation matrix as for alignment of the intrinsic imaging maps (see <xref rid="sec4.4.9" ref-type="sec">Intrinsic imaging and alignment of tonotopic maps across animals</xref>). To account for the actual spread of the optogenetic stimulus in the AC network, the response at each location was represented by a two-dimensional spatial profile identical to the estimated profile shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A for 12&#x000a0;mW/mm<sup>2</sup> focal stimuli.

For estimation of optogenetic responses at different depths,3 recordings in 3 mice (144 single units) were performed using a single shank 64 contacts across 1.4&#x000a0;mm silicon probes (A1x64-Poly2-6mm-23 s-160, Neuronexus). Before each recording, the tips of the probe were covered with DiI (Sigma). The silicon was gently removed and the area cleaned using warm Ringer&#x02019;s buffer. The probe was inserted at a &#x0223c;30&#x000b0; angle with respect to brain surface with a micromanipulator (MP-225, Butter Instrument) at 1-2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m per second, with pauses of 1-2&#x000a0;minutes every 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. Each recording session time, including probe insertion and removal, lasted no more than 3 hours. After the experiment, the animal was deeply anesthetized (isoflurane) and euthanized by cervical dislocation. Brains were fixed overnight by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1&#x000a0;M phosphate buffer (PB). Coronal brain slides of 80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m were prepared and imaged (Nikon eclipse 90i, Intensilight, Nikon) to identify the electrode track tagged with DiI and determine recording depth. For calibration of optogenetic inactivation experiments, sounds played during the recordings included a blank, 4, 4.5, 4.7, 5, 6, 8, 16 kHz pure tones of 200&#x000a0;ms duration at 60 dB SPL, a 4 kHz 500&#x000a0;ms pure tone at 70 dB SPL, 4 to 12 kHz 500&#x000a0;ms frequency modulated sound at 70 dB SPL and white noise ramps of 1000&#x000a0;ms from 60 to 85 dB SPL and 85 to 60 dB SPL. The same blue directional LED (24&#x000b0; light cone) as used for inactivation during behavior was placed above the cranial window, however at a slightly higher distance (about 0.75&#x000a0;cm) of the window to leave space for the electrode. Light was delivered for 700&#x000a0;ms, starting 100&#x000a0;ms before sound onset. Silicon probe voltage traces were recorded at 20 kHz and stored using RHD2000&#x000a0;USB interface board (Intan Technologies). Raw voltage traces were filtered using a Butterworth high-pass filter with a 100&#x000a0;Hz cutoff (Python). Electro-magnetic artifacts from the LED driving current were removed by subtracting a template calculated across all LED ON trials. For calibration of focal optogenetic activations, we used a grid of contiguous 8x5 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m circles. Each location was played randomly and repeated 10 times. Also, a 4 kHz pure tone of 500&#x000a0;ms at 70 dB SPL, 4-12 kHz FM sound of 500&#x000a0;ms at 70 dB SPL and white noise ramps of 1000&#x000a0;ms from 60 to 85 dB SPL and 85 to 60 dB SPL were played to compare later with optogenetic responses.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4.7"><title>Analysis of electrophysiology</title><p id="p0180">Spikes were detected and sorted using the KlustaKwik spike sorting algorithm (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Harris et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>) (Klusta, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kwikteam/klusta" id="intref0030">https://github.com/kwikteam/klusta</ext-link>) with a strong and weak threshold of 6 and 3 respectively. Each shank was sorted separately where putative single units were visualized and sorted manually using KlustaViewa. Data analysis was done using custom Python scripts. Spikes were binned in 25&#x000a0;ms bins. Firing rates during stimulation periods were calculated by averaging across trials. For AC inactivation, significant responses to at least one sound were identified using the Kruskal-Wallis H-test for independent samples and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to correct for multiple testing across units (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 0.05). Percentage of inhibition was calculated as&#x000a0;follows: 100 &#x02013; (L <sup>&#x02217;</sup> 100/ S), where S corresponds to best sound response and L to the response to the same sound during optogenetic activation of PV interneurons. To estimate the robustness of sound representations in our recordings, we trained a linear Support Vector Machine classifier to discriminate two sounds based on single unit responses binned in 50&#x000a0;ms bins. Only units that were inhibited by light (putative PV-negative neurons) were used to train the classifier. To evaluate classification performance without optogenetics, the classifier was trained over 5 trials for each pair of sounds and tested with other 5 trials. To test the effect of light on sound responses, the classifier was trained with 10 unperturbed sound delivery trials and tested with 10 sounds and light delivery trials. For focal optogenetic activations, we calculated for each single unit the trial-averaged firing rate change with respect to baseline over the 1&#x000a0;s optogenetic stimulation for all locations, yielding two-dimensional spatial response maps. Using the centers of each location, a 2D map was created for each unit and fitted with a two-dimensional Gaussian model that is composed of an offset term (constant over space) and a Gaussian spatial modulation term. Significance of the modulation was assessed using a bootstrap analysis (significance threshold, 0.05). Cells that did not show significant spatial modulation were described by the offset term only.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4.8"><title>Auditory cortex lesions and immunohistochemistry</title><p id="p0185">Mice after learning a PTvsPT discrimination task were anesthetized (&#x0223c;1.5% isoflurane delivered with SomnoSuite, Kent Scientific) and placed on a thermal blanket. Craniotomies were performed as described above and focused thermo-coagulation lesions were done bilaterally. The area was then covered using Kwik-Cast silicon (World precision instruments) and closed with dental cement (Ortho-Jet, Lang). After a period of recovery on a heating pad with accessible food pellets, mice were taken back to their home cage and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (Metacam&#x000ae;, Boehringer Ingelheim) was injected intramuscularly. To test if mice could still perform the discrimination task, they were placed on the behavioral setup the next day after surgery. If a mouse presented signs of pain, liquid meloxicam was given in drinking water or via subcutaneous injection. Discrimination was tested in a normal session and performance calculated as previously described. After the experiment, mice were transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1&#x000a0;M phosphate buffer (PB) and then brains post-fixed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), brains were cut in 80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m coronal slides and immuno-histochemical reactions were performed on free-floating brain slices as follows. Slides were blocked for 2&#x000a0;h using PBS&#x000a0;+ 10% goat serum and 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature. After washing in PBS (10min &#x000d7; 3), the sections were incubated 2h at room temperature with a dilution 1:100 of mouse anti-NeuN conjugated with Alexa Fluor&#x000ae; 488 (MAB377X, Merck). Slides were washed and mounted for imaging using a Nikon eclipse 90i microscope (Intensilight, Nikon).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4.9"><title>Intrinsic imaging and alignment of tonotopic maps across animals</title><p id="p0190">Intrinsic imaging was performed to localize AC in mice under light isoflurane anesthesia (&#x0223c;1% delivered with SomnoSuite, Kent Scientific) on a thermal blanket. Images were acquired using a 50&#x000a0;mm objective (1.2 NA, NIKKOR, Nikon) with a CCD camera (GC651MP, Smartek Vision) equipped with a 50&#x000a0;mm objective (Fujinon, HF50HA-1B, Fujifilm) through a cranial window implanted 1-2&#x000a0;weeks before the experiment (4-pixel binning, field of view between 3.7&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 2.8&#x000a0;mm or 164&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 124 binned pixels, 5.58-&#x003bc;m pixel size, 20 fps). Signals were obtained under 780&#x000a0;nm LED illumination (M780D2, Thorlabs). Images of the vasculature over the same field of view were taken under 480&#x000a0;nm LED illumination (NSPG310B, Conrad). Two second sequences of short pure tones at 80 dB SPL were repeated every 30&#x000a0;s with a maximum of 10 trials per sound. Acquisition was triggered and synchronized using a custom made GUI in MATLAB. For each sound, we computed baseline and response images, 3&#x000a0;s before and 3&#x000a0;s after sound onset, respectively. The change in light reflectance &#x00394;R/R<sub>O</sub> was calculated over repetitions for each sound frequency (4, 8, 16, 32 kHz, white noise). Response images were smoothed applying a 2D Gaussian filter (&#x003c3;&#x000a0;= 3 pixels). The different subdomains of AC corresponding to the tonotopic areas appeared as regions with reduced light reflectance. To align intrinsic imaging responses from different animals, the 4 kHz response was used as a functional landmark. The spatial locations of maximal amplitude responses in the 4 kHz response map for the A1, A2 and AAF (three points) was extracted for each mouse and a Euclidean transformation matrix was calculated by minimizing the sum of squared deviations (RMSD) for the distance between the three landmarks across mice. This procedure yielded a matrix of rotation and translation for each mouse that was applied to compute intrinsic imaging responses averaged across a population of mice.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4.10"><title>Two-photon calcium imaging</title><p id="p0195">Two-photon imaging during behavior was performed using a two-photon microscope equipped with an 8 kHz resonant scanner (Femtonics, Budapest, Hungary) coupled to a pulsed Ti:Sapphire laser system (MaiTai DS, Spectra Physics, Santa Clara, CA). The laser was tuned at 900&#x000a0;nm during recordings and light was collected through a 20x (XLUMPLFLN-W) or 10x (XLPLN10XSVMP) Olympus objective. Images were acquired at 31.5&#x000a0;Hz. For each behavioral trial, imaging duration was 7&#x000a0;s with a pause of 5&#x000a0;s in between trials. Sound delivery was randomized during the trial to prevent mice from starting licking with the onset of the sound (45 dB SPL) emitted by the microscope scanners at the beginning of each trial. All sounds were delivered at 192 kHz with a National Instruments card (NI-PCI-6221) driven by homemade software (Elphy, G. Sadoc, UNIC, France), through an amplifier (SA1 Stereo power amp, Tucker-Davis Technologies) and high frequency loudspeakers (SA1 and MF1-S, Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL). During the active context mice performed the discrimination task, a regular session consisted in &#x0223c;250 trials, followed immediately after by a passive context session with &#x0223c;150 trials (lick tube was withdrawn). Data analysis was performed using MATLAB and Python scripts. Motion artifacts were first corrected frame by frame, using a rigid body registration algorithm. Regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to the neurons were selected using Autocell a semi-automated hierarchical clustering algorithm based on pixel covariance over time (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Roland et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Neuropil contamination was subtracted (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kerlin et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>) by applying the following equation: F<sub>corrected</sub> (t)&#x000a0;= F<sub>measured</sub> (t) &#x02013; 0.7 F<sub>neuropil</sub> (t), where F<sub>neuropil</sub> (t) is estimated from the immediate surroundings (Gaussian smoothing kernel, excluding the ROIs (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Deneux et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), &#x003c3;&#x000a0;= 170&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m). Then the change in fluorescence (&#x00394;F/F0) was calculated as (F<sub>corrected</sub> (t) - F<sub>0</sub>) / F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> is estimated as the 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile of the low-pass filtered fluorescence over &#x0223c;40&#x000a0;s time windows period. To estimate the time-course of the firing rate, the calcium signal was temporally deconvolved using the following formula: r(t)&#x000a0;= f&#x02019;(t)&#x000a0;+ f(t) / &#x003c4; in which f&#x02019; is the first time derivative of f and &#x003c4; the decay constant set to 2&#x000a0;s for GCaMP6s. In total 7605 neurons were recorded across 11 active and 11 passive sessions in 3 mice. We kept for analysis only 1008 neurons significantly responding to the S+ or S- stimuli with respect to baseline activity (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p&#x000a0;= 0.01 and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). The deconvolved signals were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (&#x003c3;&#x000a0;= 33ms). To estimate the discriminability of two sounds based on cortical population responses, linear Support Vector Machine classifiers were trained independently on each time point to discriminate population activity vectors obtained from half of the presentations of each sound and context (training set), and were tested on activity vectors obtained on the remaining presentations of the same sounds and context or on all presentations of sounds in the non-trained context (test sets). To estimate behavioral categorization of sounds based on population activity in AC, we trained linear SVM classifier to discriminate AC responses to single presentations of the trained target sounds, and tested the classifiers with AC responses in single presentations of the non-trained sounds. Classification results were averaged across presentations to generate the categorization probability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><title>Quantification and Statistical Analysis</title><p id="p0200">All quantification and statistical analysis were performed with custom MATLAB or Python scripts.
