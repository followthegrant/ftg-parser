It has been confirmed that miR-122 is down-regulated during HBV infection; however, how HBV affects miR-122 is still debated. One research provided evidence that HBx could reduce the miR-122 transcription level, but the other insisted that HBV had no significant effect on miR-122 transcription level but reduce miR-122 level via binding and sequestering endogenous miR-122. It is determinate that Gld2 could increase the specific miRNA stabilization by monoadenylation which was a post-transcription regulation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism of HBV-induced reduction of miR-122 and examine whether Gld2 is involved in it. According to the results of a microRNA microarray, we found miR-122 was the most down-regulated microRNA in HepG2.2.15 compared to HepG2. As revealed by qRT-PCR and western blotting analyses, both miR-122 and Gld2 levels were reduced in hepatic cell lines with expression of HBV or HBx but not other proteins of HBV, and over-expression of Gld2 could abolish the effect of HBV and HBx on the miR-122 level. What's more, both HBV and HBx have no significant effect on pre-miR-122 levels. And the dual-luciferase assay implicated that HBx could reduce the Gld2 promoter activity but had no significant effect on miR-122 promoter activity. In conclusion, HBx is a critical protein derived from HBV, which regulates miR-122 via down-regulating Gld2.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from both the Chinese National Key Clinical Specialty Project (NO. 2013) and the Chinese National Science and Technology Major Project (NO. 2008ZX10202, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nmp.gov.cn/">http://www.nmp.gov.cn/</ext-link>).

It has been reported that miR-122 is very important for maintaining liver function, such as the regulation of cholesterol and fatty-acid metabolism <xref rid="pone.0092998-Esau1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092998-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Several miR-122 target genes, which contribute to tumour-genesis, have been identified, such as ADAM10, IGF1R, CCNG1, Bcl-&#x003c9;, and ADAM17 <xref rid="pone.0092998-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092998-Bai1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and low miR-122 levels are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) <xref rid="pone.0092998-Kutay1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, for example, miR-122 level was frequently reduced in HCC tissue compared to non-tumour tissue, low miR-122 was also correlated with poor prognosis <xref rid="pone.0092998-Coulouarn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092998-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and over-expression of miR-122 inhibited tumour cell growth <xref rid="pone.0092998-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Taken together, these findings indicated that miR-122 is functioning as a tumour suppressor gene. Recent studies showed miR-122 not only regulates cellular gene expression, but also plays an important role in virus replication. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication was enhanced by miR-122 by interacting with 5&#x02032;-NCR <xref rid="pone.0092998-Chang2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092998-JanssenHL1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, In contrast, miR-122 was found to inhibit hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication <xref rid="pone.0092998-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Furthermore, in chronic HBV infection patients, miR-122 was negatively correlated with intra-hepatic viral load and hepatic necro-inflammation <xref rid="pone.0092998-Waidmann1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Until now, there are two different explanations for the mechanism of HBV-related miR-122 down-regulation. One hypothesis is that the highly redundant HBV transcripts are involved in HBV-mediated miR-122 suppression by binding and sequestering endogenous miR-122, and in this process, the transcription level of miR-122 is not affected directly <xref rid="pone.0092998-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; while the other is that hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) binds PPAR&#x003b3; (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) and results the inhibition of the miR-122 transcription level <xref rid="pone.0092998-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> which is in conflict with the former. Hence, more experimental evidence is needed to explore the mechanism of HBV-related inhibition of miR-122.</p><p>Germline development 2 (Gld2, also called PAPD4) is a cytoplasmic poly(A) RNA polymerase that adds successive AMP monomers to the 3&#x02032;-end of specific RNAs, thereby forming a poly(A) tail, and controls mRNA translation <xref rid="pone.0092998-Kwak1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Gld2 enzymes acquire substrate specificity by interacting with RNA-binding proteins and are recruited to only a subset of mRNAs <xref rid="pone.0092998-Glahder1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Previous studies have mostly focused on the effect of Gld2 on mRNA. Recently, Joel D. et al. demonstrated that Gld2 could increase specific miRNA stabilisation via monoadenylation in human fibroblasts, and specifically, miR-122 could be stabilized by Gld2 <xref rid="pone.0092998-Burns1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092998-DAmbrogio1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A previous study performed in Japan <xref rid="pone.0092998-Katoh1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> also demonstrated significantly lower levels of miR-122 in the livers of Gld2-null mice. These two studies indicated that Gld2 could regulate microRNA expression at the post-transcription level.</p><p>Here, we studied the effect of HBV on the expression of miR-122 in vitro. Interestingly, we found that HBV reduced miR-122 levels by down-regulating the Gld2 gene, which might represent a new mechanism for regulating the expression of miRNAs by HBV. In addition, we confirmed that the HBx protein plays a critical role in down-regulating Gld2 protein and subsequently results in a reduction in miR-122 levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p>The Gld2-expressing plasmid was cloned by PCR from human cDNA (the reverse transcription product from human hepatic cell line QSG7701) using the following primers: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CGAAGCTTATGTTCCCAAACTCAATTTT -3&#x02032;</named-content> (sense) and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- TAGGGCCCTTATCTTTTCAGGACAGCAG -3&#x02032;</named-content> (antisense). pcDNA3.1 (pcDNA) was used as the expression vector.

First, we confirmed that the miR-122 levels in HepG2.2.15 (a derivative of stable HBV-expressing HepG2 cells) were significantly lower compared to HepG2 cells, which was consistent with the results previously reported by Wu et al. <xref rid="pone.0092998-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In addition, Meng et al. found that transfection with the HBV replication plasmid pHBV1.3 significantly decreased miR-122 levels in Huh-7 cells. Furthermore, HBV transgenic mice had lower miR-122 levels in the liver compared to BALB/c mice <xref rid="pone.0092998-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Using pHBV1.3, we confirmed the negative effect of HBV on miR-122 in three different cell lines. More importantly, we screened the four HBV proteins and identified the exact protein that reduced miR-122 levels in hepatic cells; HBx was the most effective protein. In this study, we tried to design a siRNA expression vector (psiHBx) to silence HBx in HepG2.2.15 cells. But in fact, the other proteins of HBV, even the HBV DNA in the supernatant of Cell Culture Medium, possessed of different inhibitory action (data not shown). The psiHBx might not specifically inhibit HBx, for the HBx gene overlaps with pregenomic RNA and HBsAg specific RNAs <xref rid="pone.0092998-Bouchard1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, we presented the further evidence that expression of other proteins of HBV have no significant effect on miR-122 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092998-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Taken together, the results from our study and those of others support that HBV and HBx down-regulate miR-122 levels in hepatic cells. However, the route that HBV takes to reduce miR-122 levels remains controversial.</p><p>MicroRNA levels are related to transcription, processing, and turnover <xref rid="pone.0092998-JMNewman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Two recent studies have provided two different explanations for the mechanism of miR-122 down-regulation. Meng et al. found that transfection of pHBV1.3 in Huh7 cells could increase miR-122 promoter activity and miR-122 primary transcription (pri-miR-122) rather than decreasing them, which indicated that HBV did not down-regulate miR-122 levels via the transcription pathway <xref rid="pone.0092998-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Although the results of Tong et al. indicated that HBx protein could reduce miR-122 promoter activity by binding to PPAR&#x003b3; in both HepG2 and Huh7 cells <xref rid="pone.0092998-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, we found that the activities of the miR-122 promoter varied in different cell lines expressing HBx proteins (increased in HepG2 and QSG7701 cells but non-significantly decreased in Huh7 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092998-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Despite these findings, pre-miR-122 in all of the three cells lines did not decrease when HBV or HBx was expressed. The selected promoter sequences of miR-122 were essentially the same as those of the previous two related studies. However, the different results might be due to the different experimental conditions and/or different cell lines. In previous studies, HBx was found to inhibit the normal function of p53 <xref rid="pone.0092998-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and p53 could inhibit the expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4&#x003b1; (HNF4&#x003b1;) <xref rid="pone.0092998-Maeda1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, a key regulator of miR-122 expression in the liver <xref rid="pone.0092998-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. It may implicate that HBx could potentially affect miR-122 promoter activity indirectly and these effects could change under different conditions and/or different cell lines. In the cell lines we used, HepG2 cells were found to express small amounts of wild type p53, whereas Huh7 cells were shown to express mutation p53 <xref rid="pone.0092998-Mller1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. What's more, HNF4&#x003b1; was up-regulated in HBV-infected cells <xref rid="pone.0092998-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Though further evidence is needed, it may explain the increased miR-122 promoter activities in QSG7701 and HepG2 cells but not in Huh7 cells. Moreover, we also had the hypothesis that there might be some feedback signal to stimulate the miR-122 promoter when the miR-122 was reduced by HBx, for the positive or negative feedback control signal is often exist to maintain the normal levels of a special object in cells. In addition, HBx was found to down-regulate the Drosha which participate in processing pri-miRNA to release pre-miRNA <xref rid="pone.0092998-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It may explain the increased miR-122 promoter activities resulted in the similar pre-miR-122 levels. Thus, the relationship between HBx and miR-122 may be more complicated than we have known. Since the transcription pathway cannot always explain the low miR-122 levels in HBx-expressing cells, there must be other pathway(s) related to the down-regulation of miR-122 induced by HBx.</p><p>Gld2 has been shown to have important effects on the stability of many miRNAs, including miR-122, via catalysed 3&#x02032; monoadenylation <xref rid="pone.0092998-Burns1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092998-Katoh1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A decrease in Gld2 levels could cause a reduction in mature miR-122 levels but not pre-miR-122 levels <xref rid="pone.0092998-DAmbrogio1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Here, we found that HepG2.2.15 cells had lower Gld2 mRNA and protein levels compared to HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092998-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), which suggested that the change in Gld2 was positively correlated with miR-122. Moreover, transfection of HBx in vitro also resulted in a reduction in Gld2 expression both at the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092998-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of HBx in HBV-infected cells could increase miR-122 and Gld2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092998-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). In addition, the expression of Gld2 could abolish the reduction of miR-122 induced by HBV and HBx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092998-g004">Figure 4B, 4C</xref>). These findings indicated that down-regulation of miR-122 by HBV or HBx might be due to a reduction in Gld2. However, when we transfected the pGld2 to over-expressing Gld2 in hepatic cells, the endogenous Gld2 was still the main parts of the total Gld2 (more than 60%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092998-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). Thus, the effect of HBV or HBx to endogenous Gld2 was hard to be covered up by the exogenous over-expression of Gld2 and it may be partly explain the Gld2 over expression could not completely rescue the down-regulation effect of HBV infection and HBx expression to miR-122. Of course, other path ways to reduce the miR-122 by HBV cannot be denied. Furthermore, we found that the activity of the Gld2 promoter was reduced in all three cell lines when the cells were transfected with HBx-expressing plasmids. A review has pointed out that HBx does not directly bind DNA, and regulates transcription by direct interaction with nuclear transcription components or activation of cytosolic signal transduction pathways <xref rid="pone.0092998-Bouchard1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Hence, further studies are needed to investigate the precise transcription factor that induced the relationship between HBx and Gld2. Furthermore, HBx/Gld2/miR-122 may be one important pathway for hepatocarcinogenesis, representing a correlation between miR-122 and liver cancer <xref rid="pone.0092998-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0092998-Kutay1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, according to a study completed by D'Ambrogio et al., there are approximately 50 miRNAs that may be monoadenylated by Gld2 <xref rid="pone.0092998-DAmbrogio1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Thus, HBx may affect other miRNAs via the down-regulation of Gld2 expression. In our study, four of five miRNAs (let-7i, let-7d, miR-145, miR-22, and miR-122), which are stabilised by Gld2 <xref rid="pone.0092998-DAmbrogio1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, were analysed in our miRNA microarray results. In addition, all of the miRNAs were down-regulated in HepG2.2.15 compared to HepG2 cells (data not shown). However, real-time PCR or northern blotting analyses should be performed to confirm these findings. In addition, information indicating that Gld2 may be an important factor for the effect of HBV on miRNAs is needed. There may be several regulatory mechanisms that coexist to regulate miR-122 levels in HBV-infected cells.</p><p>Taken together, we found that Gld2 is down-regulated by HBx, which results in the reduction of miR-122 levels in HBV-infected cells. This process is post-transcriptionally regulated. Thus, this study provides a new mechanism to explain the effect of HBV on miRNA expression.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Songdong Meng (the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)) for providing the pHBV1.3 vector.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0092998-Chang1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
