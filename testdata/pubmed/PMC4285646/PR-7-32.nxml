In Malaysia, FD is locally known as Mas cotek.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Traditionally this plant was used in the treatment of several diseases including gout, high blood pressure; blood circulation, pneumonia, diarrhea, skin infection and diabetes.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Studies have shown that FD leaf possess antinociceptive, wound healing and antioxidant properties.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] These beneficial effects have been attributed to the presence of compounds such as polyphenols, flavonoids, amino acids, vitamins, carbohydrates, and purine alkaloids.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>L-arginine is classified as a semi-essential or conditionally essential amino acid [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. It serves as a substrate for the enzyme nitric oxide synthetase (eNOS), which converts L-arginine to L-citrulline and produces nitric oxide (NO).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] L-arginine is also very important in a number of essential processes such as cell division, ammonia removal, wound healing, immune function, and hormones release.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The metabolites of L-arginine are involved in many physiological and pathological processes. Previous studies have demonstrated that L-arginine might have an antihypertensive effect.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The creatural experiment showed that L-arginine function to protect cerebral ischemic tissues.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Thirteen weeks of oral administration of L-arginine in rats on a high-cholesterol diet showed that generation of vascular NO was increased, and endothelial release of superoxide anions was decreased with regression of intimal atherosclerotic lesions.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Intracoronary infusion of L-arginine in patients with hypercholesterolemia and in patients with microvascular angina pectoris as well as in those with atherosclerosis was normalized the defective acetylcholine-induced vasodilation of coronary microvessels.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In another study, chronic oral supplementation of L-arginine improved coronary small-vessel endothelial function in association with a significant improvement in symptoms and a decrease in plasma endothelin concentrations.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Citrulline, a byproduct of the NOS-catalyzed reaction, can be recycled to produce arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline&#x02013;NO or arginine&#x02013;citrulline.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Arginine can also be synthesized in cells from citrulline by the sequential action of two urea cycle enzymes, argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structure of L-citrulline (a) and L-arginine (b)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PR-7-32-g001"/></fig><p>L-citrulline is a nonprotein amino acid and was first identified from watermelon (<italic>Citrullus vulgaris</italic> Schrad).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] L-citrulline plays a key role in mere metabolic intermediate, especially in the urea cycle.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Moreover, it was emerged as a product of the NO cycle and precursor for the biosynthesis of arginine.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] L-citrulline is known as an essential amino acid for young mammals and adults with trauma, burn injury, massive small bowel resection and renal failure.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] It is synthesized via argininosuccinate synthase and ASL in all animal cells.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] One of the important biological functions of L-citrulline is through production of NO, which liberated during conversion of citrulline to arginine by the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase (reference). Furthermore, this enzyme is also responsible for conversation of arginine back into citrulline.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Previous studies suggested that, a dietary supplement rich in L-citrulline seems to improve sexual stamina and erectile functions while the exact mechanism is not known.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Limited number of chromatographic methods including HPLC, capillary electrophoretic and anion exchange chromatography for analysis of L-citrulline and L-arginine have been reported.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In chromatographic methods, due to the lack of a suitable chromophore in amino acid's structures it is necessary to label them using labeling reagent, such as 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4-sulfonyl chloride (dabsyl chloride), <italic>O</italic>-phthaladehyde (OPA) or phenylisothiocyanate.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In such a case, it involves derivatisation with precolumn or postcolumn and detection by fluorescence, ultraviolet (UV) or diode array detector.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Due to vast biological significance, there is a demand for rapid and effective analytical methods for the analysis of L-citrulline and L-arginine, which should be suitable across a wide range of research and practical applications. In this context, the objective of the present study is to develop simple, rapid and isocratic reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with UV detection for simultaneous identification and quantification of the two amino acids L-citrulline and L-arginine in FD leaf extracts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>L-citrulline, L-arginin, OPA and &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia).

Subsequently, the reaction mixture was immediately analyzed by HPLC. The derivatization solution was freshly prepared everyday as the following; 5 mg of OPA was dissolved in 0.05 mL of methanol, and it was added to 0.45 mL of 0.4 M boric acid/borate buffer (pH 9.5), followed by addition of 25 &#x003bc;L of &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Chromatographic conditions</title><p>The HPLC method was developed for the determination of L-citrulline and L-arginine using a Zorbax Eclipse C18 SB-Aq column (250 &#x000d7; 4.6 mm, 5 &#x003bc;m) (Agilent).

The spiked extract solutions were injected three times, and the recovery was calculated with the value of detected versus added amounts. Precision of the method was determined as percentage relative standard deviation (SD) of peak area of intra-day and inter-day analysis data. Three different concentrations of the standards were analyzed per day for the intra-day analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 6), and on different days (<italic>n</italic> = 6) for inter-day analysis of precision. The resulting peak area was used to calculate SD and the relative standard deviation (%RSD). The linearity of the method was constructed using the calibration curve over eight different concentrations in the range 0.1-1000 &#x003bc;g/ml (<italic>n</italic> = 3). LOD and LOQ were measured based on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) method. Determination of the S/N was performed by comparing measured signals from samples at known low concentration of analyte with those of blank samples and establishing the minimum concentration at which the analyte can be reliably detected. An S/N of 3 is generally considered acceptable for LOD, while LOQ is established at an S/N of 10.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Development and validation of high performance liquid chromatography analytical method</title><p>HPLC separation of a standard mixture was achieved using described method.

Some HPLC methods have been previously used for analysis of L-citrulline and L-arginine in plants. However, in those studies mostly other derivatization reagents were used such as naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde, 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4&#x02019;- sulfonyl chloride (dabsyl chloride) or phenylisothiocyanate and others.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In comparison, in this study, the OPA derivatives are relatively stable and prolong the life-span of the chromatography column. Most of the previous methods performed by other researchers require fluorescence detection.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Although, in this study UV&#x02013;visible detector was used. Meanwhile, this method was used to identify and quantify L-citrulline and L-arginine in the plant extract for the first time in FD leaf extracts. This method may have the potential for the routine analysis of L-citrulline and L-arginine in commercial and biological samples.</p><p>In summary, effective RP-HPLC method with UV detector has been successfully developed to determine the content of two amino acids, L-citrulline and L-arginine in FD leaf extracts. The proposed method is a sensitive, reliable and efficient analytical platform for simultaneous determination of L-citrulline and L-arginine, either qualitatively or quantitatively. This method can be used for fingerprint profiling and for the standardization of herbal medicines and herbal products from FD extracts.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The
