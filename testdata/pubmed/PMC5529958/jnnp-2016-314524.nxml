Participants were sampled with a preference for those estimated to be at the highest risk. Lower risk subjects (and middle risk) were required for comparative analysis and also to maintain blinding of participants to risk (for distribution of risk scores see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure 1</xref>). Geographical location did not bias assessment and participants were seen regardless of where they resided in the UK. Acceptance rates to telephone invitations for home visits are provided in the online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S1</xref>.</p><p>During the domiciliary visit, a neurological examination was carried out by a trained clinician (AJN), including the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson&#x02019;'s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor section (part III), which was recorded on video (<italic>all reference to MDS-UPDRS throughout the manuscript refers to part III motor scores only</italic>).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> During the same visit, participants were assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which has been widely used as a cognitive screening tool.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Video scoring</title><p>Two senior movement disorders experts (AJL and AS), who were blind to risk estimates and were provided with no additional information about participants, independently scored the participant videos using the MDS-UPDRS.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Rigidity scores were provided for each participant from the examination by AJN, given that this could not be ascertained from watching the videos. After all videos were scored, marks were compared between raters. Where no significant disparity existed between individual raters' scores (&#x0003c;5 point difference on the MDS-UPDRS), the scores from both were averaged. Where there was disparity in scores (&#x02265;5 points), the raters were asked to rescore again independently. If significant disparity remained, the raters rescored jointly to obtain a consensus score.</p><p>The original version of the UPDRS can be used to calculate an abbreviated score of &#x02018;Mild Parkinsonian Signs&#x02019; (MPS). The most widely used version is that developed by Louis <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> (for details on scoring see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary material</xref>). Bradykinesia does not feature in the MPS score, because its presence is an essential feature in the diagnostic criteria for PD.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> We therefore included bradykinesia as an additional outcome, considering bradykinesia as definite when combined scores from the MDS-UPDRS bradykinesia items (finger tapping, hand movements, hand pronation/supination, toe tapping and leg agility) were &#x02265;1.5. We used a second definition of MPS or subthreshold parkinsonism described recently by an MDS Task Force, with scores &#x0003e;6 on the MDS-UPDRS (excluding action and postural tremor) indicating subthreshold parkinsonism.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>In addition to these two UPDRS-based scores, raters were asked to give a &#x02018;global impression&#x02019; comment. After all videos had been rated, these comments were coded as the following ordered categorical variables: 0&#x02014;normal, 1&#x02014;minor clinical abnormality not necessarily associated with PD, 2&#x02014;subtle clinical observation associated with PD, 3&#x02014;suspected/possible early PD/parkinsonism, and 4&#x02014;probable PD based on the Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders diagnostic criteria.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Again, these global impression scores were averaged for the two raters. Consensus was sought for &#x02018;suspected&#x02019; or &#x02018;probable&#x02019; PD (scores of 3 or 4). Cut-offs for our &#x02018;global impression&#x02019; score were as follows: scores &#x02264;1.0 considered as not indicative of parkinsonism, scores 1.5 to 2.5 indicative of subtle parkinsonism and &#x02265;3.0 considered as clear evidence of parkinsonism.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The aim of the study was to test the null hypothesis of no difference between the higher compared with lower (combined middle and lowest risk) risk subjects in the frequency and severity of motor dysfunction as assessed on the blinded ratings of the video recordings. Risk scores were calculated and higher risk and lower risk groups were calculated as described previously using the year 1 online assessment as this was closest to the home visits in the majority of cases.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>First, the scores from the raters were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots, along with measures of bias and agreement. Where there was substantial disparity, measures were taken to obtain consensus before final scores were analysed (see above).</p><p>Second, the representativeness of sampled participants compared with the overall cohort was examined. Higher risk as well as lower risk participants that had been seen were compared with those not seen in terms of age, gender and other demographic information used for risk stratification, as well as MoCA scores, smell test scores and measures of motor function as described above.</p><p>Analyses using continuous and categorical motor outcomes were undertaken comparing higher risk subjects with lower risk subjects, using t-tests for parametric and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests for non-parametric continuous data, Fisher's exact test for binary data, and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for trend for ordinal data.</p><p>Linear regression was used to analyse the relationship of continuous risk estimates with MDS-UPDRS (excluding action and postural tremor) using the log odds of PD. Multivariate linear regression was undertaken to examine the influence of potential confounding factors such as prevalent cognitive impairment (using MoCA scores) and factors that increase risk of cerebrovascular disease. Vascular risk factors included: self-reported diabetes or use of antidiabetic drugs, hypertension or use of antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), &#x003b2;-blockers and diuretics), hypercholesterolaemia or use of statins, ischaemic heart disease and current smoking.</p><p>Age and gender were felt likely to confound the relationship between risk and motor outcomes, but their significant weighting in the algorithm meant that adjusting could lead to multicollinearity and increased standard error. Hence, a separate regression model was run in which the association between risk estimates without the contribution of age or gender and motor outcomes was examined to determine the role of other factors in the algorithm. All analyses were performed in Stata V.12 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Two hundred eight participants were assessed at home between October 2012 and September 2015. Four participants were excluded in line with the exclusion criteria of the study (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary material</xref>): one received lithium, two had cognitive impairment (MoCA &#x0003c;22) and one had had a previous stroke. Seven participants reported that they had been independently diagnosed with PD by neurologists during this period. All seven of these subjects were also reviewed in person, and identified as having PD by both raters on blinded video analysis. These were excluded from all further analyses. Video recordings were, therefore, scored and analysed from 197 participants.</p><p>The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for scores by raters 1 and 2 was 0.78 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.84) after the first round. A difference between raters of &#x02265;5 points on the MDS-UPDRS occurred for 24 out of 197 subjects (12%). These were rescored independently in round 2, resulting in an ICC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.89). After round 2, a difference between raters of &#x02265;5 points still existed for 10 participants and these were scored jointly (final ICC 0.93; 95% CI 0.90 to 0.95).

The MDS-UPDRS is more sensitive to subtle changes in movement, particularly those relating to repetitive movement such as finger tapping. We also observed a greater proportion of higher risk subjects (30%) with bradykinesia compared with lower risk (15%).</p><p>MPS have been associated with increasing age, cognitive impairment and cerebrovascular disease.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The strength of association between estimated risk of PD and MDS-UPDRS in our study tended to increase when age and gender were dropped from the analysis and when analyses were adjusted for a combination of vascular risk factors and MoCA scores, suggesting that while age and gender are included in the algorithm, neither these nor vascular risk factors nor mild cognitive impairment are sufficient to account for the association. Together these results, given the strength of associations and the consistency across criteria using blinded assessments, suggest that at least in some higher risk subjects these MPS are a harbinger for future PD rather than simply a form fruste or mimic driven by vascular disease or mixed pathology.</p><p>Although seven patients with PD diagnosed independently during study follow-up were excluded from the outset, the &#x02018;global impression&#x02019; score and associated MDS-UPDRS scores for three additional cases suggested that they may have been prevalent cases of undiagnosed PD. Excluding these three subjects did not alter any of the results (<italic>note these are not the participants depicted in the videos)</italic>.</p><p>Other groups have identified MPS in volunteers with individual risk factors for PD. In the Bruneck Study Cohort, increasing age, vascular risk factors, loss of olfactory function and hyperechogenicity in the region of the substantia nigra using transcranial sonography were found to be predictive of MPS.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In the TREND study, olfactory deficit, subjective RBD, male gender and nigral hyperechogenicity were linked to MPS.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Shulman <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> used genotyping data to explore associations between PD risk loci and MPS, finding associations between <italic>MAPT</italic> and <italic>CCDC62</italic> with global parkinsonism and bradykinesia specifically. Separately, an analysis of a large series of volunteers without a diagnosis of PD found an association between MPS elicited during in life and neuronal loss in the nigra at postmortem, but not Lewy body pathology, raising the possibility that neuronal loss underlies these signs.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Finally, Postuma <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> prospectively demonstrated the gradual emergence of objective and rating scale-derived features of PD in a cohort of participants with idiopathic RBD, up to the point at which a proportion met diagnostic criteria for parkinsonism. This study nicely showed how MPS can evolve over time, but RBD represents a specific model for prediagnostic PD, which may not be the same as the course that most PD patients follow. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a composite PD risk score has been used to identify probable MPS at the population level.</p><p>The magnitude and consistency of associations makes chance an unlikely explanation for the results but as with other aspects of the PREDICT-PD study, selection bias may have played a part and we acknowledge that the proportion of subjects with a family history of PD is higher than in the general population. However, the frequency of a positive family history is not as high as reported in the PARS study, and is similar to the TREND study, despite the investigators more stringent definitions.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Furthermore, while we excluded subjects with an incident diagnosis of PD during follow-up, we cannot discount that some of the participants may have taken part because they suspected that they might have early signs of PD. Observer bias would have been substantially reduced by blinding raters to participant risk estimates. Good ICCs were obtained between the two raters for participants included in the analysis, despite the great difficulty in rating subtle features compared with well-established parkinsonian features, and were excellent after contentious cases were reviewed again. Likewise, agreement between raters was also acceptable in Bland-Altman analyses. ICCs were substantially better when PD cases were included, which emphasises the fact that subtle parkinsonism can be hard to detect (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary material</xref>). Finally, this cross-sectional analysis of MPS may have been prone to measurement error given recent evidence that MPS may be transient in the early stages of PD.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Taken together with earlier work showing an increase of intermediate markers for PD (olfactory dysfunction, subjective RBD, and slow finger tapping) in the higher risk group, we have increasingly strong evidence to support enrichment for underlying risk of PD in PREDICT-PD.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Future work in these participants will seek to define the course of subtle parkinsonian signs, their relationship with other symptoms in the prediagnostic phase and those features that best predict future diagnosis of PD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank and acknowledge all of the participants who have helped support the PREDICT-PD project.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AJN was involved in design and conceptualisation of the study, analysis and interpretation of data, drafting the manuscript for intellectual content.
