Using EEG recorded in 12 adults with autism and age-matched controls performing a visual target detection task, we characterized the influence of a certain context (targets preceded by a predictive sequence of three distinct stimuli) or an uncertain context (random targets) on behavior and electrophysiological markers of predictive processing. During an uncertain context, adults with autism were faster than controls to detect targets. They also had an enhancement in CNV amplitude preceding all random stimuli&#x02014;indexing enhanced preparatory mechanisms, and an earlier N2 to targets&#x02014;reflecting faster information processing&#x02014;compared to controls. During a certain context, both controls and adults with autism presented an increase in P3 amplitude to predictive stimuli&#x02014;indexing information encoding of the predictive sequence, an enhancement in CNV amplitude preceding predictable targets&#x02014;corresponding to the deployment of preparatory mechanisms, and an earlier P3 to predictable targets&#x02014;reflecting efficient prediction building and implementation. These results suggest an efficient extraction of predictive information to generate predictions in both controls and adults with autism during a certain context. However, adults with autism displayed a failure to decrease mu power during motor preparation accompanied by a reduced benefit in reaction times to predictable targets. The data reveal that patients with autism over-anticipate stimuli occurring in an uncertain context, in accord with their sense of being overwhelmed by incoming information. These results suggest that adults with autism cannot flexibly modulate cortical activity according to changing levels of uncertainty.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>prediction</kwd><kwd>uncertainty</kwd><kwd>ERP</kwd><kwd>mu oscillations</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000065</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">R37NS21135</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Agence Nationale de la Recherche<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001665</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">ANR-11-LABX-0042</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">ANR-11-IDEX-0007</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="8280"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social communication and interaction, associated with restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (American Psychiatric Association, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The insistence on sameness is a fundamental feature of ASD and is incorporated into diagnostic criteria. Clinical reports of individuals with ASD show that they react in an unusual way (they may feel stressed and anxious) to unpredictable change occurring in their environment. Such a crucial need for stability in individuals with ASD might arise from a dysfunction in the ability to predict events especially in an ever-changing world (Gomot and Wicker, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Pellicano and Burr, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Palmer et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Lawson et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Van de Cruys et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Pathological restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests, rituals, and routines could represent attempts to regulate uncertainty by imposing sameness and order (Gomot and Wicker, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Pellicano and Burr, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lawson et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition, social-communication impairments in ASD could be the consequence of difficulties in adapting quickly to the unpredictable social world (Gomot and Wicker, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lawson et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Van de Cruys et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Robic et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the brain mechanisms of predictive processing in adults with ASD.</p><p>Predictive coding formulations of perception propose that expectations in higher brain areas generate top-down predictions that meet bottom-up stimulus signals in lower hierarchical areas (e.g., Friston, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This prediction capacity is essential to efficiently adapt behaviors in an ever-changing world (Bubic et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Predictive processing comprises several processes such as the generation of prediction based on encoding of predictive information, and the implementation of prediction via the deployment of both attentional and motor preparatory mechanisms, resulting in facilitated processing of upcoming events, and optimized behaviors indexed by reduced reaction times. In a previous study using a detection task manipulating target predictability (Bidet-Caulet et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we defined electrophysiological (EEG) markers of these different stages in typically developing adults. The P3 amplitude to predictive stimuli was found to index predictive information encoding, increase in the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV; pre-stimulus slow ERP) amplitude to reflect the deployment of preparatory mechanisms, decrease in mu power to reflect motor cortex activation, and the P3 latency to predicted target to serve as a measure of the prediction building and implementation (Bidet-Caulet et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>While the encoding of explicit predictive non-social cues has not been examined in ASD, some electrophysiological studies have found inconsistent findings, with evidence for atypical preparation in 8&#x02013;13 year old children (indexed by an increase in CNV amplitude; Tye et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) or for a preserved preparation in adults (no significant difference in CNV amplitude compared to controls; Strandburg et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) with ASD without intellectual disability. Reduced motor anticipation has been clinically reported in ASD since the Kanner initial case reports (Kanner, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1943</xref>) and recently from a retrospective study (Brisson et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Electromyographic studies found substantial anticipation difficulties, reinforcing these clinical observations (Schmitz et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Cattaneo et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). More precisely, an electrophysiological study investigating the theta frequency band in children (which corresponds to the classic mu rhythm recorded in adults) using a bimanual load-lifting task revealed a lack of increased cortical activity of the motor areas before voluntary unloading in the ASD group (Martineau et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>Using EEG recorded in 12 adults with autism and age-matched controls performing a visual target detection task, we characterized the influence of a certain context (targets preceded by a 100% predictive sequence of three distinct stimuli), or an uncertain context (random targets) on behavior and electrophysiological markers of predictive processing. Thus, based on this paradigm, we wanted to answer the following questions: (1) do adults with ASD benefit from the predictive information behaviorally (indexed by reduced reaction times)? (2) do the brain mechanisms involved in predictive processing in a certain context are atypical in adults with ASD? (3) do the brain mechanisms involved in predictive processing in an uncertain context are atypical in adults with ASD (4) what steps involved in prediction, such as extraction of predictive information (indexed by an increase in P3 amplitude) required to generate prediction, attentional, and motor preparation mechanisms (reflected by an increase in CNV amplitude and a decrease in mu power) corresponding to the implementation of prediction (indexed by a reduced target-P3 latency) are specifically affected in adults with ASD?</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Twelve adults with ASD without intellectual disability (10 males and 2 females, 1 left-handed), aged from 18 to 27 years (mean &#x000b1; Standard Error of the Mean = 21 years, 4 &#x000b1; 10 months) were recruited from the Child Psychiatry Department specialized in autism, University Hospital of Tours, France. They were diagnosed by expert clinicians according to DSM-IV-TR criteria (American Psychiatric Association, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) and using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G; Lord et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) and/or the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R; Lord et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). ASD participants did not present any comorbidity at the time of the study. Intelligence quotients (IQ) were assessed by the Wechsler intelligence scales according to the subjects' ages and developmental levels (Wechsler, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Intelligence scales provided overall intellectual (mean &#x000b1; SEM = 101 &#x000b1; 5), verbal (mean &#x000b1; SEM = 100 &#x000b1; 3), and performance quotients (mean &#x000b1; SEM = 104 &#x000b1; 7).</p><p>Twelve healthy volunteers (mean &#x000b1; SEM = 21 years, 7 &#x000b1; 11 months; 10 males and 2 females, 1 left-handed) also participated in the study as control (CTRL) subjects. None of these healthy adults had a previous history of psychiatric or neurological problems and they were not taking any drug. The two groups were matched in age, gender, and handedness. While a full Wechsler was administered to the adults with ASD, two non-verbal subtests (block design and matrix reasoning) of Wechsler intelligence scales were used in the CTRL group. Block design standard scores ranged from 1 to 16 (ASD: 10.8 &#x000b1; 1.2; CTRL: 11.8 &#x000b1; 0.8), and matrix reasoning standard scores ranged from 6 to 14 (ASD: 10.1 &#x000b1; 0.8; CTRL: 10.7 &#x000b1; 0.4). No significant difference between groups was found on the standard scores obtained from these 2 subtests using randomization tests (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.45).</p><p>All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The local ethical committee board (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes de Tours Ouest-1, France) approved the protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Stimuli and tasks</title><p>Subjects sat in a chair in a sound-attenuated room, 94 cm in front of a 19-inch PC screen. The experimenters and computers delivering the visual stimuli and recording the EEG were located in a separate room. We used a paradigm designed to investigate predictive context processing adopted from Fogelson et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Stimuli were presented centrally on a computer screen and subtended 3&#x022c5; of visual angle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Stimuli</bold>. A sequence of triangles was centrally presented on a screen. A target could be a random target (randT) preceded by a non-informative context (random sequence of stimuli) or a predictable target (predT) preceded by an informative context, i.e., a three-stimulus predictive sequence (leftward-, upward-, and rightward-facing triangles). Triangles of the predictive sequence are labeled as predS1, predS2, and predS3 stimuli, whereas the corresponding triangles outside the predictive sequence are labeled as randS1, randS2, and randS3, for leftward-, upward-, and rightward-facing triangles, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnins-10-00317-g0001"/></fig><p>Stimuli consisted of 15% of targets (downward-facing triangle) and 85% of equal amounts of three types of standards: Triangles facing left, upward, or right. A target could be a random target (randT) preceded by an uncertain context (random sequence of stimuli) or a predictable target (predT) preceded by a certain context, i.e., a three-stimulus predictive sequence (leftward-, upward-, and rightward-facing triangles). Triangles of the predictive sequence are labeled as predS1, predS2, and predS3 stimuli, whereas the corresponding triangles outside the predictive sequence are labeled as randS1, randS2, and randS3, for leftward-, upward-, and rightward-facing triangles, respectively. Participants were instructed to press a button with the dominant-hand index finger in response to target stimuli (downward-facing triangles) and to look for the predictive sequence. Before the recording began, subjects performed a first training session to ensure they were able to detect the target accurately. In a second training session, subjects were introduced to the predictive sequence and were aware that it would be 100% predictive of a target, but that targets would also appear randomly throughout the block. Especially for the adults with ASD, training sessions were repeated as many times as necessary to ensure full understanding of the instructions.</p><p>In each block (~2.3 min long), a total of 127 stimuli (11 randTs, 28 randS1, 28 randS2, 28 randS3, 8 predTs, 8 predS1, 8 predS2, and 8 predS3) were presented each for 150 ms with an inter-stimulus interval of 1 s. 17 subjects performed 15 blocks, one subject performed 12 blocks, 2 subjects performed 10 blocks, and 4 subjects performed 4&#x02013;8 blocks due to fatigue. The stimulus presentation and response recordings were controlled using Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Electroencephalography recording and analysis</title><p>EEG was recorded from 64 electrodes using Active Two system (Biosemi, The Netherlands). Vertical eye movements were monitored using electrodes placed above and below the left eye. The signal was recorded with a sampling frequency of 512 Hz and filtered at 0&#x02013;104 Hz. Data were re-referenced offline to the average potential of the two earlobe electrodes.</p><p>EEG analyses were based on results from a previous study (Bidet-Caulet et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). They were performed on standard and target visual stimuli embedded or not embedded in the predictive sequence. We excluded from further analysis: Trials corresponding to standards after a target, standards before or after a button press, a randS2 standard preceded by a randS1 standard but not followed by a randS3 standard (as it is a potential predS2 standard), missed targets, and targets preceded by less than three standards. Eye-movement artifacts were detected using independent component analysis (ICA) and were selectively removed via the inverse ICA transformation. Only 1 or 2 independent components were removed in each subject to clean the data. In five subjects, the flat or excessively noisy signals at one or two electrodes were replaced by their values interpolated from the remaining electrodes using spherical spline interpolation (Perrin et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). Trials contaminated with excessive muscular activity in the (&#x02212;700; 700 ms) time-window relative to stimulus onset were also excluded.</p><p>As the number of trials for stimuli embedded in the predictive sequence was lower than for the other stimuli, we equalized the number of trials within each pair of to-be-compared stimuli by random selection, for each participant. On average across participants, we obtained mean &#x000b1; SEM: 68 &#x000b1; 4, 83 &#x000b1; 5, 83 &#x000b1; 5, and 72 &#x000b1; 5 clean trials for randS1/predS1, randS2/predS2, randS3/predS3, and randT/predT pairs, respectively, for each participant.</p></sec><sec><title>Event-related potential (ERP) analysis</title><p>We averaged single trials, locked to stimulus onset, separately for each of the eight stimulus categories (randS1, randS2, randS3, randT, predS1, predS2, predS3, predT). The resulting event-related potentials (ERPs) were digitally band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 30 Hz to analyze slower components, or between 4 and 30 Hz to extract early and transient responses by filtering out slow and large components (such as the Continent Negative Variation or CNV and P3) that can overlap fast and small responses (Bidet-Caulet et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). For post-stimulus analysis, ERPs were corrected with a &#x02212;100 to 0 ms baseline before stimulus onset. For pre-stimulus analysis, ERPs were not baseline corrected. ERP scalp topographies were computed using spherical spline interpolation (Perrin et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Time-frequency (TF) analysis</title><p>We analyzed oscillatory activities by means of a Gaussian Morlet's wavelet decomposition (for details, see Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). This method led to a power estimate of both evoked (phase-locked to stimulus onset) and induced (jittering in latency) activities in the TF domain. To distinguish induced from evoked activities (reflecting the frequency content of ERPs), we computed, at each point of the TF domain, the stimulus phase-locking factor from the single-trial TF analysis (Tallon-Baudry et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). This factor ranges from 0 (uniform phase distribution, i.e., high-latency jitter) to 1 (strict phase-locking to the stimulus). The Rayleigh statistic was used to test for the non-uniformity of phase distribution (Jervis et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>), with a threshold of 0.25 to test non-uniformity with &#x003b1; = 0.05: A phase-locking factor superior to 0.25 indicated a non-uniform phase distribution and the underlying oscillations were considered to be phase-locked to the stimulus. To assess the deployment of oscillatory activities around the stimuli, we analyzed the oscillation on a large time-window (&#x02212;500; 500 ms) around each type of stimulus. In each group, we applied the same baseline correction to all stimuli by subtracting the mean power between &#x02212;500 and &#x02212;250 ms before all S1 onset, in each frequency band. We focused our analysis on the alpha frequency band (8&#x02013;14 Hz). Since mu rhythm is recorded over the sensorimotor cortex (central electrodes) at the same frequency range than alpha rhythm (Pineda, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), we deliberately distinguished mu and alpha oscillations based on the topography. Importantly, no difference was observed between CTRL and ASD on the mean power in the 8&#x02013;14 Hz band in the &#x02212;500 to 500 ms time-window around S1.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To assess statistical differences between groups and conditions, we used a repeated-measure analysis of variance (rmANOVA) with group (ASD vs. CTRL) as the between-subject factor and predictability (predictable vs. random) as the within-subject factor.</p><p><italic>Post-hoc</italic> analyses were performed with statistical tests based on permutation or randomization for intra- or inter-group comparisons, respectively (Edgington, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Permutation tests consisted of (1) the random permutation of the 12 pairs (corresponding to the 12 subjects) of values, (2) the sum of squared sums of values in the two obtained samples, and (3) the computation of the difference between these two statistic values. We performed all possible permutations (4096) to obtain an estimate of the distribution of this difference under the null hypothesis. This distribution was then compared to the actual difference between the values in the two conditions. Randomization tests consisted of (1) the random constitution of the two samples to compare, (2) the sum of squared sums of values in the two obtained samples, and (3) the computation of the difference between these two statistic values. We performed 10,000 such randomizations to obtain an estimate of the distribution of this difference under the null hypothesis. This distribution was then compared to the actual difference between the values in the two conditions.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis of behavioral data</title><p>A button press within the interval of 100&#x02013;1100 ms after a target onset was considered as a correct response, and a press after a standard was counted as a false alarm (FA). Reaction times (RTs) were computed for correct trials, only. We investigated the benefit in RTs with the predictive context independently of RT to randTs by calculating a RT prediction index [(RT randT-RT predT)/RT randT].</p><p>The effect of predictability on the % of hits and RTs was assessed using rmANOVAs. The differences between groups on the % of FAs and the RT prediction index were assessed using randomization tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis of event-related potentials and oscillatory activities</title><p>To investigate predictive processing in adults with ASD, we compared ERPs and oscillatory activities to the same physical stimuli embedded (predictive stimuli) or not embedded (non-predictive stimuli) in the predictive sequence. No difference was predicted and none was observed between predS1 and randS1 as participants did not know at that time if the stimulus was part of the predictive sequence or not.</p><p>For statistical analysis, we computed the rmANOVA on the latencies of N1 (105; 230 ms) and P2 (205; 310 ms) peaks at PO4, and on the latencies of P2 (155; 255 ms) and N2 (215; 350 ms) peaks at FCz. For the P3 to targets, we also analyzed the latency and amplitude of the P3 maximum peak at Pz in the (250; 750 ms) time-window.</p><p>To go further and beyond peaks and components, we also performed rmANOVAs for each of the 64 electrodes on specific time-windows based on results in previous EEG studies (Fogelson et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bidet-Caulet et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). To correct for multiple tests, we first calculated a corrected <italic>p</italic>-value across time (e.g., 0.05 divided by the number of tested time-windows) and then an effect was deemed significant if a <italic>p</italic>-value inferior to this threshold was found on at least 4 adjacent electrodes.</p><p>To analyze early and transient ERPs, we computed the rmANOVA on the 4&#x02013;30 Hz band-pass-filtered ERP (pre-stimulus baseline-corrected) amplitude within successive 10 ms time-windows of the (0; 400 ms) time-window relative to stimulus onset.

We also computed a randomization test on the pre-stimulus activity before all standards (randS) on the mean amplitude in the (&#x02212;50; 0 ms) time-window to analyze predictive processing within the uncertain context.

Critically, adults with ASD displayed an enhanced CNV before the random standards and targets compared to controls, providing evidence of deployment of atypical increased preparatory mechanisms. In addition, adults with ASD displayed a shortened N2 latency to the random target, suggesting shorter stimulus evaluation (Donchin et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Hillyard and Picton, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and response activation time (Smid et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>), supporting faster visual information processing in adults with ASD.

However, adults with ASD failed to display this mu decrease before the predictable target, suggesting reduced motor preparation.

In an optimal system, precision in prediction errors (i.e., brain's degree of confidence in the sensory signal) decreases in contexts with higher uncertainty (i.e., when there are no learnable regularities in the environment). The CNV component has been proposed as a proxy for the precision of prediction errors (Feldman and Friston, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Hesselmann et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and its amplitude is enhanced with increasing certainty in normal populations. In agreement with this model, the CNV amplitude increased with enhanced predictability of the upcoming stimulus in typically developing participants in the present and previous studies (Bidet-Caulet et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Interestingly, we found that adults with ASD generate a larger CNV, compared to controls, in an uncertain context before all random standards and targets. This result suggests that, in the random context, patients with ASD give a high precision to prediction errors as if they were still looking for learnable regularities; whereas typically developing individuals reduce their precision in prediction errors&#x02014;they sense that there are no learnable regularities. Adults with ASD resist uncertainty and tend to generate higher levels of sensory precision (Van de Cruys et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This finding is in line with an inability to flexibly process prediction errors (Palmer et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Van de Cruys et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and with a failure to attenuate sensory precision.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size. Further, investigations on bigger sample size are needed in order to confirm our results.</p><p>We demonstrate that adults with ASD over-anticipate stimuli occurring in an uncertain context. In a certain context, ASD subjects are able to extract predictive information and to use it in order to anticipate the predictable targets. However, the present results may reflect frontal compensation strategies to counteract the lack of automatic motor cortex pre-activation for execution of the motor response. There is a cost to this excessive processing that may be counterproductive in unpredictable and fluctuating situations, such as the social world, leading to stressful reactions, and a sense of overwhelming. Taken together, these results provide evidence that adults with ASD cannot flexibly modulate cortical activity according to changing levels of uncertainty. Moreover, these findings could ultimately contribute to the treatment of adults with ASD without intellectual disability. Further, research is needed in order to build cognitive remediation programs to provide strategies to patients with ASD so that they overcome prediction weaknesses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>AT has made a substantial contribution to the conception and design, to the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of the data; ML, ED, and CB have made a substantial contribution to the interpretation of the data; SR has made a substantial contribution to the conception and design, and to the acquisition and analysis of data; RK, AC, and FB have made a substantial contribution to the conception and design, and to the analysis and interpretation of the data.
