function, deep abdominal muscle thickness, and balance ability in stroke patients.
[Subjects] Twenty-three stroke patients were randomly allocated to an experimental (n =
11) or control group (n = 12). [Methods] The experimental group received inspiratory
muscle training-based abdominal muscle strengthening with conventional physical therapy;
the control group received standard abdominal muscle strengthening with conventional
physical therapy. Treatment was conducted 20 minutes per day, 3 times per week for 6
weeks. Pulmonary function testing was performed using an electronic spirometer. Deep
abdominal muscle thickness was measured by ultrasonography. Balance was measured using the
Berg balance scale. [Results] Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second,
deep abdominal muscle thickness, and Berg balance scale scores were significantly improved
in the experimental group than in the control group. [Conclusion] Abdominal muscle
strengthening accompanied by inspiratory muscle training is recommended to improve
pulmonary function in stroke patients, and may also be used as a practical adjunct to
conventional physical therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Abdominal muscle thickness</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Abnormalities of posture, muscle tone, and motor control of voluntary movement, and reduced
participation of trunk muscles, can affect motor abilities and respiratory muscle
activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke resulting in
weakness of these muscles can lead to cardiopulmonary volume adjustments and lack of oxygen,
which can disrupt cardiovascular conditioning and the oxygen transfer system<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This state can cause stroke patients, who
require intensive rehabilitation, to tire easily during aerobic activities that require
endurance, thereby restricting performance of activities of daily living<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) for improvement in respiratory function involves the
application of a load to the diaphragm. Auxiliary inspiratory is reported to improve muscle
strength and endurance. The basic principles of skeletal muscle strengthening were applied
to the overload, specificity, and reversible<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to previous studies, IMT can improve maximal inspiratory
pressure, lung function, endurance, and exercise performance after 6&#x02013;8 weeks of

reported that respiratory metabolism is reflected in exercise performance. Bosnak et
al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that IMT statistically
increased quadriceps strength and balance ability in patients with heart failure. Exercise
at greater than approximately 85% of maximum capacity was reported to cause fatigue in the
diaphragm. Fatigue in respiratory muscles can be reduced or delayed by strengthening; this
improves exercise capacity and respiratory movement, which are necessary for improvement in
functionality<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, IMT, such as breathing exercise for
thoracic mobility, has been widely used as a therapeutic intervention<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there is a lack of reports on IMT in patients
with stroke, or chronic stroke patients with paralysis and coordination disorders caused by
cerebrovascular disease, and the effects of balance ability on pulmonary function. The
purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of IMT on balance ability and changes
in abdominal thickness and lung function in chronic stroke patients, and to provide basic
data for use in intervention programs for these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sahmyook University. Twenty-three stroke

abdominal muscle thickness, and balance ability in stroke patients after 6 weeks of
training.</p><p>Exercise to improve respiratory function is the most important factor in therapeutic
interventions because it affects the functional recovery of stroke patients. The IMT group
showed significant improvement in balance, TA and IO thickness, FVC, FEV1, and PEF (p &#x0003c;
0.05). Compared to the control group, the IMT group seemed to be significantly more
efficient in terms of increasing FVC and FEV1 (p &#x0003c; 0.05). This result is similar to the
result reported by Sutbeyaz et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, who
assigned 45 subacute stroke patients into IMT and control groups. In their study, lung
function, recovery status, activities of daily living, and quality of life were performed
for 6 weeks, six times a day for 30 minutes during the week. The breath-training group
revealed significant differences in FVC and FEV1, but no significant difference in PEF. Jung
et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that IMT with
abdominal electronic stimulation improved pulmonary function in chronic stroke patients.
According to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, the FVC/FEV1 ratio is an
important indicator for diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease when the value is
lower than 60% (normal is approximately 80%). In this study, IMT and control groups were not
statistically significantly different in all the comparisons. This result could be useful in
determining whether lung function in stroke patients with restrictive ventilation disorders
had improved during the course of IMT.</p><p>Breathing is movement of air in and out of the lungs in response to volume changes in the
thoracic diaphragm, followed by the intercostals, rectus abdominis, TA, and multiple
accessory muscles. According to previous research, application of chest expansion resistance
exercises by a therapist is recommended if the environment and conditions are appropriate
for enhancement of chest expansion capacity and maximal inspiratory pressure in elderly
people<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the FVC, the TA and
intercostals are used to exert pressure on the lower ribs by bending the torso and inducing
deep breathing with the lifted diaphragm<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to our results, the significant increase in thickness of
the deep abdominals indicates that strengthening exercises affect muscle contraction. No
statistically significant difference was observed in a comparison between the groups.</p><p>Increased inspiratory muscle fatigue can lead to respiratory and nonrespiratory fatigue of
the upper spine<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fatigue is conveyed
through the blood flow to the extremities and reflected in the plantar flexor muscles before
the onset of inspiratory fatigue<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Blood
flow to the extremities is reduced because of inspiratory muscle fatigue but can be improved
by IMT. In addition, IMT for the diaphragm and scalene can help stabilize thoracic mobility,
and contributes to chest balance and transfer abilities<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bosnak et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>
applied IMT at 40% resistance of PEF training in 16 patients out of an experimental group of
30 patients with heart disease for 6 weeks. The quality of life, lung function, balance, and
quadriceps strength significantly improved. Lucinda et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> studied subjects who performed IMT at home for 10 weeks. There were
significant differences in balance, functional stair, sit-to-stand, and 6-minute walking
tests between IMT and control groups.</p><p>Based on these results, we conclude that IMT training could be useful in improving lung
function in stroke patients with restrictive lung disease. Rehabilitation using conservative
physical therapy plus respiratory exercise could be a useful intervention for stroke
patients in clinical settings. Further research is needed to develop a new IMT program that
