Based on results from a study of Sri Lankans in Oslo, Norway and Sri Lanka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], it was assumed that the standard deviation (sd.) of D would be 22.8 in both groups.</p><p id="Par26">N independent samples t-test, with 5% significance level, was used when comparing mean D in the two groups. The study should hold at least 80% test-power to detect a difference in mean D between groups, if the true mean difference in D was at least 20. It was then shown that at least 21 males had to be included in each group. The assumption that the difference in mean X between the groups was realistic; it was decided to include at least 21 males in each group. Since the sd. of D in a Norwegian population is 24.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the same calculation and assumptions were done for the Norwegian control populations arriving at the same number of required patients and controls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Population</title><p id="Par27">Based on the above calculation, 21 ethnic Norwegians and 27 ethnic Tamil political refugees living in Norway for more than 5&#x02009;years, all with the clinical diagnosis &#x0201c;established periodontal disease&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], were recruited as test populations for this case control study. Twenty-three Norwegians and 21 ethnic Tamil political refugees living in Norway, all periodontally healthy, were recruited as control subjects. &#x0201c;Periodontally healthy&#x0201d; was defined as no loss of attachment (no previous history of periodontal disease), no pocket depths <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>&#x02009;3&#x02009;mm. The periodontal patients were recruited from two private practices in the greater Oslo area, whereas the Tamil and Norwegian control subjects were recruited from the register of patients and staff at the Institute of Clinical Odontology, Dental Faculty, University of Oslo, Norway. The Regional Committee for Medical &#x00026; Health Research Ethics, Oslo, Norway (REK) approved the study (Approval No. 2015/443). The study was performed during autumn 2015.</p><p id="Par28">The inclusion criteria for both populations were males, 30&#x02013;70&#x02009;years, diagnosis of &#x0201c;established periodontitis&#x0201d; based on clinical attachment level (CAL) and probing pocket depth (PPD) measurements, i.e. &#x0201c;the presence of CAL &#x02265; 6 mm in 2 or more teeth and one or more sites with PPD &#x02265; 5 mm&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, it must be remembered that these clinical measurements only reflect the history of periodontal destruction and not an ongoing periodontitis. These participants will further be referred to as the &#x0201c;test groups&#x0201d;. Both light smokers and non-smokers were recruited. Patients were asked if they smoked, and if so, how many cigarettes they consumed per day. None of the included test or control persons used smokeless tobacco. Participants had to be willing to sign an informed consent form. Exclusion criteria were any general disease or condition, drug or alcohol abuse.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Clinical screening of periodontal disease</title><p id="Par29">One periodontist (HRP) and one periodontal specialist candidate (VK) screened and included all periodontitis patients and controls based on the criteria mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Prior to screening, VK was calibrated to HRP on both reading PPD and CAL. The procedure is described in Preus et al. 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Since the focus of this study was on VitD&#x02019;s bone affecting properties and periodontal destruction, radiographic identification of marginal bone level (RBL) was employed as the surrogate for the periodontal diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Radiograpic examination</title><p id="Par30">Radiographic images were obtained by the Soredex Digora Optime (Soredex, Finland) digital phosphor storage plate system and Planmeca intra (Planmeca Oy, Finland) X-ray units. For full radiographic examination, 10 phosphor storage plates were used in Eggen&#x02019;s holders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. For BiteWing radiographs (BW), Quick Bite&#x000ae; holders (Hawe Neos, Kerr, Switzerland) were used, and all readable sites from the distal surface of canines to the mesial surface of second molars were registered. Radiographic images were calibrated and exported by the Digora&#x000ae; for Windows software to 8bit grey scale Tagged Image File Format files. The calibration information in the image files (i.e. Exif information) were used to obtain the coordinates of the sites. The latest version of the <italic>ImageJ</italic> image processing and analysis software program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] was used for the experiment. An application (plugin) to this program had been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] with the intent to semi-automatically register the ratio between the bone level and the corresponding length of tooth in longitudinal studies. The plugin allowed for just pointing and clicking on the Cemento-Enamel Junction (CEJ), alternatively the Restoration Margin (RM) and Alveolar Crest (AC) to digitally register these points. This technique has proven more accurate, versatile and easy to use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] than the original <italic>ImageJ</italic> technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] even for direct measurements like in the present study.</p><p id="Par31">In short, the computer application automatically stores the marked coordinates (relative to the upper left corner of the image) and projects them onto an imaginary vertical axis parallel to the vertical dimension of the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The coordinates, unit of length, time and date of measurement were automatically stored in a text file, which was imported into an EXCEL spreadsheet to automatically calculate the distance from the RBL.</p><p id="Par32">Only one researcher (VK), who had been trained extensively in the above-described reading method, examined the radiographs. After training, VK was presented two sets of masked full mouth radiographs (10 radiographs each) in addition to 10 BW radiographs (2 radiographs in each) from randomly chosen patients from the Clinic of Periodontology. These were read once before being re-masked and re-examined. Thus, altogether 40 radiographs were examined twice by the above described technique, and the intra class correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] was calculated to be 0.91.</p><p id="Par33">The study radiographs from patients and controls were blinded and randomized using a macro (program code) written in the <italic>ImageJ</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] macro language.</p><p id="Par34">The image files were numbered, randomly reorganized and blinded to the reader. Bone level was measured as the distance from the CEJ or RM to the most coronal level of the AC. The point where the periodontal space retained its normal radiographic width was considered the alveolar crest, and infrabony pockets were measured to the point of the most apically advanced radiolucency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. All sites on the x-rays not clearly identifiable, as well as any other uncertainty regarding identification of the measured sites were excluded from the study as non-readable sites.</p><p id="Par35">Following the reading of images, a second macro was used to replace the coded filename with the original patient reference in the result file using the key file.

There was a small difference in the Tamil periodontitis and control groups as well, although not statistically significant. In these populations combined, the odds ratio for having periodontal disease was significantly reduced with increasing levels of VitD.</p><p id="Par46">RBL represents the history of destructive periodontitis in each patient, and does not indicate active periodontal disease, whereas VitD levels reflect an actual status being subject to seasonal fluctuations and dietary habits. Seasonal fluctuations in VitD levels, due to varying sun exposure seem more important than dietary habits, which are more stable ingredients in human lives. According to a study by the University of Oslo, Norway and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Sri Lankan men living in Norway increased their VitD status from an average of 30.5&#x02009;nmol/L following winter (early April) to 38.9&#x02009;nmol/L in summer (June), i.e. an increase of 8.4&#x02009;nmol/L during spring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This was comparable to the reduction recorded (i.e. 9.1&#x02009;nmol/L) in ethnic Norwegians (men and women) in the period August/September to January [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Since there are no systematic registrations of seasonal variations in VitD in Sri Lankans living in Norway or ethnic Norwegians, the above reports were the best we could find. However, the above variations accounted for a little shy of 10&#x02009;nmol/L between seasons in both populations. Although only based on these observations, this might indicate that a person of low VitD remains in the lower channel, and vice versa. A hypothesis might therefore be that people have an individual natural history of varying low or varying high VitD, possibly connected to accompanying diseases when low. When compensated for by VitD supplements, this might change this hypothetical receptivity of VitD associated traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">For ethical reasons and since there was no need for extensive radiological examination in the control groups, only recently obtained BW radiographs were used for identifying bone level. Most Norwegians, including our control populations, attend their dentist once or twice a year, where also BWs are obtained, and therefore we were able to get recent BWs from all control persons. For therapy in periodontitis patients, the Norwegian health authorities require a full radiographic status (10 radiographs), since Norway offer considerable public refund for this kind of treatment. Proper documentation of disease is therefore mandatory. Thus, RBL levels of all periodontitis patients in this study were registered on these recently obtained radiographs, which were taken for therapy purposes. The question of full mouth - versus partial mouth recordings has been explored by Kingman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] suggesting that partial mouth examination suffices in identifying periodontal disease in patients.</p><p id="Par48">Another major challenge affecting measurements of bone level changes on radiographs is the angle by which the radiographs have been obtained. A deviance in angle between the beam direction in BW and full tooth radiograph is obvious, especially in the upper canine region. This problem has been addressed by Preus et al. 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and it was shown that a change in beam angle (&#x003b1;) of 30<sup>o</sup> resulted in an 11% increase of RBL readings of an actual bone level of 7&#x02009;mm. The increased reading will be reduced as the actual bone level is reduced, and at 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;mm an &#x003b1; of 30<sup>o</sup> will not increase RBL significantly. Therefore, comparing the disease - with the control groups by radiographs as described should be acceptable.</p><p id="Par49">It may be argued that the examiner would recognize the control subjects on the BW radiographs. However, BW included Tamil as well as Norwegian control subjects. Moreover, the radiographs were masked prior to - and de-masked following the reading by the IT engineer (GRT). Therefore, the examination should be regarded as masked.</p><p id="Par50">In this study, smoking was of a minor consequence since only very few of the periodontitis patients smoked, and those who did, smoked &#x0003c;&#x02009;5 cigarettes/day. It is not customary to smoke in Norway, and in 2018 less than 12% of Norwegians smoked on a daily basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which explains the low rate of smokers in our populations. The reason inclusion allowed smokers was that it was expected difficult to find enough Tamil healthy controls based on the description of this population in &#x0201c;the natural history of periodontal disease&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Never the less, none of the healthy controls, regardless of ethnicity, smoked. The two ethnic test groups could therefore be regarded as equal in this regard as well.</p><p id="Par51">A study by the Norwegian Institute for Public Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] showed that Tamils living in Sri Lanka and Norway had an average VitD blood level of 54.2 and 31.5&#x02009;nmol/L respectively. The Tamil subjects (periodontitis patients and controls alike) in the present study were diagnosed with an average VitD level of 33.9&#x02009;nmol/L, which was in concert with the above mentioned study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], as with another study of Indian Tamils as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In the same study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], ethnic Norwegians were diagnosed with an average VitD level of 74.6&#x02009;nmol/L whereas the present study reports an average VitD level of 57.7&#x02009;nmol/L. This difference might be explained by the timing of blood sampling of the present study which was in the autumn of 2015, following a summer that had been less sunny and significantly colder and rainier than normal. One should then expect the Tamils to suffer from the same lack of sun. However, as the blood VitD decreases there are compensatory mechanisms preventing the fall of VitD to critically lower levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] which might explain the differences between the ethnic groups exposed to the same amount of sun.</p><p id="Par52">In Norway VitD levels &#x0003c;&#x02009;50&#x02009;nmol/L; 50&#x02013;75&#x02009;nmol/L; 80&#x02013;120&#x02009;nmol/L are respectively regarded as deficiency, suboptimal and optimal. None of the study participants reported to have taken any medicinal VitD supplements for 3&#x02009;months prior to this study, although it is customary for Norwegians to take cod liver oil for daily VitD and &#x003a9;<sub>3</sub> supplements during the winter. Nutritional habits were not explored to the full, but an inclusion regime based on nutritional habits would make this study impossible since dietary habits between, as well as within, these populations would vary considerably.</p><p id="Par53">Low levels of VitD have been associated with periodontal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, in these studies only soft tissue measurements (PPD and CAL) have been used as the basis for the diagnosis. As described by Preus et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] soft tissue reactions like gingival inflammation and edema may variably contribute to inflate measurements of PPD and CAL. Therefore, to avoid contamination of various soft tissue reactions, like gingivitis associated with insufficient oral hygiene, only radiographic signs of bone loss were used as surrogate for the diagnosis of periodontitis in the present study. Again, it must be emphasized that even RBL only reflects the history of the sum of destructive events that has happened to the patient, and not the indication of an active disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">The findings in the present study seem at a first glance to be in agreement with studies showing that subjects with periodontal disease have lower levels of VitD than those with better periodontal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], at least in Caucasians. However, the findings also suggest a more complex, but less clear association between VitD and periodontal disease, expressed as surrogate RBL, than those previously published, as both Tamil periodontitis patients and healthy controls had comparable VitD status. Although only based on two different ethnic groups, and with all due caution, the results from the present study might suggest that VitD have different reference values and effect on periodontal health in different ethnic groups, and that the ethnicity being not associated with disease might be &#x0201c;masked&#x0201d; by the preponderance of the Norwegian difference in VitD levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec60"><p>
