Receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3), a mediator of necroptosis, is implicated in atherosclerosis development. Additionally, hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) protects the vascular endothelium against hyperglycemia-induced injury and attenuates atherosclerosis. On the basis of these findings, the present study aimed to confirm the hypothesis that necroptosis mediates high glucose (HG)-induced injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and that the inhibition of necroptosis contributes to the protective effect of exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S against this injury. The results revealed that exposure of HUVECs to 40 mM HG markedly enhanced the expression level of RIP3, along with multiple injuries, including a decrease in cell viability, an increase in the number of apoptotic cells, an increase in the expression level of cleaved caspase-3, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Treatment of the cells with sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS; a donor of H<sub>2</sub>S) prior to exposure to HG significantly attenuated the increased RIP3 expression and the aforementioned injuries by HG. Notably, treatment of cells with necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), an inhibitor of necroptosis, prior to exposure to HG ameliorated the HG-induced injuries, leading to a decrease in ROS generation and a loss of MMP. However, pre-treatment of the cells with Nec-1 enhanced the HG-induced increase in the expression levels of cleaved caspases-3 and -9. By contrast, pre-treatment with Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, promoted the increased expression of RIP3 by HG. Taken together, the findings of the present study have demonstrated, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S protects HUVECs against HG-induced injury through inhibiting necroptosis. The present study has also provided novel evidence that there is a negative interaction between necroptosis and apoptosis in the HG-treated HUVECs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hydrogen sulfide</kwd><kwd>high glucose</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>necroptosis</kwd><kwd>receptor interacting protein 3</kwd><kwd>interaction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hyperglycemia, an important characteristic of diabetes mellitus, is considered to be a dangerous factor of diabetic complications. It is able to induce dysfunction of the vascular endothelium through various pathophysiological mechanisms, which are associated with atherosclerosis, leading to target organic impairment, such as blindness (<xref rid="b1-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), kidney failure (<xref rid="b2-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), and cardiovascular diseases (<xref rid="b3-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Hence, it is crucially important to protect endothelial cells against hyperglycemia-induced injury.</p><p>Numerous processes have been demonstrated to be associated with injury induced by hyperglycemia, including apoptosis (<xref rid="b4-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), oxidative stress (<xref rid="b5-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref rid="b5-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Traditionally, cell death was divided into three categories: Apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy. Apoptosis is an alternative term for programmed cell death, which allows cells to commit suicide according to a specifically designated program in the absence of inflammation. Autophagy is another mechanism, which leads to formation of autophagosomes in a dying cell to maintain homeostasis of the organism. By contrast, necrosis is regarded as a passive and unregulated form of cell death, which is characterized by early plasma membrane destruction and swelling of the intracellular organelles. However, necroptosis (also termed 'programmed necrosis') (<xref rid="b6-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), a newly identified form of programmed cell death, has broken the traditionally understood concept of cell death. In contrast with apoptosis, necroptosis operates according to a caspase-independent mechanism. Receptor-interacting protein (RIP)1 and RIP3 serve a critical role as signal transducers in the pathway of necroptosis. Recently, significant progress has been made in the study of necroptosis. RIP3-mediated necroptosis has now been determined to be a common cell-death pathway implicated in cytokine-, virus-, and genotoxic stress-induced cell death, and has also been identified to participate in a variety of pathological conditions, including the immune response (<xref rid="b7-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), multiple tissue injury (<xref rid="b8-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), the retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury (<xref rid="b9-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and myocardial infarction (<xref rid="b10-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, the role of necroptosis in hyperglycemia-induced injury of endothelial cells has yet to be fully elucidated.</p><p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), previously regarded as a poisonous gas emitted from rotten eggs, has been demonstrated to be an endogenously produced, labile diffusible mediator with multiple roles in the cardiovascular system associated with health and disease (<xref rid="b11-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), including vasodilation (<xref rid="b11-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and the stimulation of angiogenesis (<xref rid="b13-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the endothelial protective effect of H<sub>2</sub>S against injuries. Mani <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b20-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) reported that decreased endogenous production of H<sub>2</sub>S accelerates atherosclerosis. Upon application of H<sub>2</sub>S, the progression of atherosclerosis was inhibited in fat-fed apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="b21-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Notably, it was shown that low levels of H<sub>2</sub>S in the blood of patients with diabetes and streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats may be associated with vascular inflammation (<xref rid="b22-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Absence of cystathionine &#x003b3;-lyase, a synthase of H<sub>2</sub>S, exacerbates hyperglycemic endothelial cell dysfunction (<xref rid="b6-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition, exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S was shown to protect vascular endothelium against high glucose (HG)-induced injuries, including an overabundant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a decrease in cell viability, and DNA injury, by preserving mitochondrial function (<xref rid="b6-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Since cardiac RIP3 expression was shown to be increased in diabetic rats (<xref rid="b23-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and RIP3 is involved in atherosclerosis development (<xref rid="b24-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), the present study aimed to explore the influence of HG on the expression level of RIP3, and the role of necroptosis in the HG-induced injury, and to examine whether exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S protects against HG-induced injury by inhibiting necroptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Materials and reagents</title><p>Sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS), necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), Z-VAD-FMK, Hoechst 33258, 2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and rhodamine 123 (Rh123) were purchased from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany).

Increasing evidence has indicated the involvement of necroptosis in a variety of pathological conditions, including diabetic cardiac injury (<xref rid="b23-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and development of atherosclerosis (<xref rid="b24-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, the roles of necroptosis in HG-induced vascular endothelial injury, and in the protection afforded by exogenously added H<sub>2</sub>S are, at present, unclear. The present study clearly demonstrated the following effects of HG-treatment of the HUVECs: i) HG significantly enhanced the expression level of RIP3, a kinase promoting necroptotic cell death; ii) Nec-1, an inhibitor of necroptosis, attenuated the HG-induced injury, including ROS generation and a loss of MMP; iii) a negative interaction between necroptosis and apoptosis was observed; on the one hand, Nec-1 increased the expression level of cleaved caspase-3, whereas on the other, Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, upregulated the expression level of RIP3; iv) exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S ameliorated the HG-induced increase in the expression level of RIP3 and endothelial injury, leading to an increase in cell viability and a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells and the expression level of cleaved caspase-3, ROS generation, as well as dissipation of MMP. Taken together, the findings of the present study have provided, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence that necroptosis mediates HG-induced injury, and that the inhibition of necroptosis contributes to the protective effect of exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S against HG-induced injury in HUVECs.</p><p>Hyperglycemia is a risk factor associated with vascular dysfunction, resulting in various vascular diseases, which may be a contributor towards morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients (<xref rid="b26-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Thus, further exploration of the mechanisms underlying hyperglycemia-induced vascular endothelial injury is very important for the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications, such as retinopathy (<xref rid="b28-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and nephropathy (<xref rid="b29-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Multiple factors have been revealed to contribute towards hyperglycemia-elicited vascular endothelial damage, for example, ROS generation (<xref rid="b5-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), mitochondrial damage (<xref rid="b5-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and cell death, including apoptosis and necrosis (<xref rid="b30-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Recently, a novel mechanism termed necroptosis or 'programmed necrosis' has been suggested as another critical mediator of cell death in the heart (<xref rid="b31-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;-dependent formation of a complex between RIP1 and RIP3 is an important step for the induction of necroptosis (<xref rid="b32-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In this process, RIP3 appears to exert a key role, controlling RIP1 phosphorylation (<xref rid="b33-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However, although a recent study has indicated that RIP3 is overexpressed in diabetic myocardial tissue (<xref rid="b23-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), the effect of hyperglycemia on RIP3 in the vascular endothelial cells remains unclear. To investigate this, dose- and time-response experiments to determine the expression level of RIP3 were performed in the HG-treated HUVECs. The data from these experiments revealed that exposure of the cells to HG significantly upregulated the expression level of RIP3, suggesting the induction of necroptosis in the HG-treated HUVECs. Combining our results with the findings reported by Liu <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b23-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), it was revealed that hyperglycemia may be a strong stimulus for inducing necroptosis in the cardiovascular tissues.</p><p>That necroptosis has been demonstrated to be implicated in ischemia-induced cardiac lesions (<xref rid="b10-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b35-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and the development of atherosclerosis (<xref rid="b24-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) inspired us to explore the role of necroptosis in HG-triggered injury in the endothelial cells. Consistently with a previously published study (<xref rid="b6-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), the results of the present study demonstrated that exposure of HUVECs to HG induced multiple injuries, as indicated by a decrease in cell viability and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells, the expression level of cleaved caspase-3, ROS generation, as well as dissipation of MMP. However, treatment of the cells with Nec-1 (an inhibitor of necroptosis) prior to exposure to HG markedly attenuated HG-induced injury, leading to a decrease in ROS generation, as well as a loss of MMP. These results suggested that necroptosis is involved in HG-induced injury in HUVECs, which may be a novel mechanism responsible for hyperglycemia-induced vascular endothelial injury.</p><p>It has been indicated previously that necroptosis may function as a cellular 'backup' mechanism to ensure the elimination of damaged cells under certain conditions when apoptosis is inhibited (<xref rid="b6-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b36-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). RIP3 has been reported to participate in mediation of apoptosis and necrosis (<xref rid="b37-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In addition, results from a recent study revealed that the presence of Nec-1 shifts shikonin-induced necroptosis to apoptosis (<xref rid="b25-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Based on other published studies (<xref rid="b6-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b36-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b38-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), the present study aimed to explore further the interaction between necroptosis and apoptosis in the HG-treated HUVECs. The results demonstrated that pre-treatment with Z-VAD-FMK (an inhibitor of caspase) prior to the exposure of HUVECs to HG may markedly enhance the expression level of RIP3. It is noteworthy that pre-treatment with Nec-1 prior to exposure of the cells to HG clearly upregulated the expression of cleaved caspases-3 and -9. These findings suggested that there is a negative interaction between necroptosis and apoptosis in the HG-treated HUVECs. The results of the present study are supported by other recent studies (<xref rid="b6-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b36-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b38-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). However, Zhang <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b37-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) demonstrated that Nec-1 attenuates the expression level of cleaved caspase-3 in 11&#x02032;-deoxyverticillin A (C42)-treated human colon cell lines. The reasons underlying this different conclusion are complex, although one possible explanation may be concerned with the different experimental models and different cell lines used.</p><p>Another novel finding of the present study is associated with the contribution of necroptosis to the protective effect of exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S against HG-induced injury in HUVECs. H<sub>2</sub>S, as an endogenously produced gas transmitter, is cardiovascular-protective (<xref rid="b6-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b11-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b38-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="b39-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Accumulating evidence has indicated that exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S protects cardiac cells against the HG-induced injury (<xref rid="b16-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b18-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>S replacement also improves endothelial function in hyperglycemic endothelial cells and in diabetic rats (<xref rid="b5-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In agreement with a previously published study (<xref rid="b5-ijmm-41-03-1477" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), the findings of the present study demonstrated that exposure of HUVECs to HG induced multiple injuries, including cytotoxicity, an increase in the number of apoptotic cells and the expression level of cleaved caspase-3, ROS generation, as well as a loss of MMP. However, exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S protected the cells against the above injuries. Importantly, the results of the present study demonstrated that exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S markedly alleviated the increased expression of RIP3 by HG, suggesting an inhibitory effect of exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S on HG-induced necroptosis. Also taking into consideration with these results our finding that necroptosis mediates HG-induced HUVEC injury, the present study supports a novel hypothesis that inhibition of necroptosis may be one of the key mechanisms underlying the protective effect of H<sub>2</sub>S against the HG-induced endothelial injury.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study has highlighted the role of necroptosis in HG-induced endothelial cell injury, and its potential clinical significance. Hence, necroptosis may become a novel therapeutic target when establishing treatment strategies. Crucially, it has been demonstrated, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S protects HUVECs against HG-induced injury by inhibiting the necroptosis pathway. Furthermore, in spite of the identification of the interaction between necroptosis and apoptosis, it may not be assumed that the inhibition of necroptosis or apoptosis does not mean prevention of the cells from mortality. Rather, it has been demonstrated that H<sub>2</sub>S may inhibit both apoptosis and necroptosis, suggesting that it is a favorable protective agent. Thus, exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S may be a major factor to take into consideration when developing novel therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment for diabetic cardiovascular complications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The present study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81450062) and Natural
