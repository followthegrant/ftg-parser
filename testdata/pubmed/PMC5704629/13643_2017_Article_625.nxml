The methodological handbooks for systematic review methodology, such as The Cochrane or CRD Handbooks, provide practical (although limited) instruction on how to undertake each supplementary search method, and empirical studies have evaluated the effectiveness and efficiencies of these search methods. What is perhaps less certain is how supplementary search methods actually work, and what the advantages, disadvantages and resource implications of each search method are.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aim</title><p id="Par13">The aim of this study is to compare empirical studies of supplementary search techniques to the recommendations in methodological handbooks.</p><p id="Par14">By re-considering the best practice guidance of methodological handbooks for systematic review, and reviewing how this guidance has been interpreted and evaluated within current practice by authors, this study seeks to identify claimed advantages, claimed disadvantages and resource requirements of using supplementary search methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The research question for this study</title><p id="Par15">The research question for this study is how do empirical studies of supplementary search techniques compare to the recommendations in review methodology handbooks?</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par16">This study aims to produce a structured methodological overview of methodological handbooks on the conduct of supplementary searches in systematic reviews. In addition, we reviewed studies that report on the utility and practice of supplementary searches. In order to identify this literature, a systematic approach to study identification, study selection and data extraction was used, which is set out below. These two types of literature&#x02014;handbooks and practical explorations of applying supplementary search strategies&#x02014;were then compared. The advantages, disadvantages and resource requirements of each method were evaluated.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study identification</title><p id="Par17">We selected the following methodological handbooks as the most influential handbooks in informing systematic review practice in the UK.

Studies were identified by searching five bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, LISTA, ASSIA and Web of Science in July 2016. Forward citation chasing was applied to studies meeting inclusion at full text, and the bibliographies were appraised. Tables of included studies were examined if aggregated within systematic reviews.

The studies included in this review suggested that the reasons for &#x02018;non-citation&#x02019; are unclear and could range from selective citation (i.e. selective reporting) to pragmatic reasons, such as a review of trials being cited instead of each individual trial reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, a high number of citations for a study should not necessarily be confused as an indicator of study quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] or a complete citation network. Non-citation of studies, or &#x02018;linking lag&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], forces a break in citational networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], meaning it becomes unclear when (or if all) studies have cited a primary study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There is presently no method to assess the completeness of citational networks and no certainty as to the comprehension of any citation chasing.</p><p id="Par121">There is little common agreement between the studies as to which tool (or combination of tools) is superior in citation chasing, since the relative merits of each resource depend greatly upon the topic of review, the data range of the resource and the currency of the results (c.f. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]). A study that evaluated the tools (Web of Science, SCOPUS and Google Scholar), how the tools are best searched, how the platform hosts select data for inclusion and the advantages and disadvantages of use would make clearer statements on when (or if) to use which tools.</p><p id="Par122">There are, undoubtedly, advantages to citation searching. The citational link is neutral, in the sense that it only links the studies but it does not explain the nature of the link. This is important, since a citation search will identify <italic>any</italic> study linked to the primary study, including erratum studies and studies that dispute or disagree with the primary study, and it should also link different publication types, such as editorial content, reviews or grey literature. This could not only aid interpretation of studies but also it could help researchers explore the idea of study impact. Furthermore, as reported in the &#x02018;<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>&#x02019; section, a citation search links by citation and it is not beholden to the use of &#x02018;the correct&#x02019; search terms or database indexing. It may, therefore, as Papaioannou et al. reported, facilitate serendipitous study identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], suggesting that citation chasing is valuable in scoping review topics, to aid development of searches, and review searches, in order to ensure all studies have been identified.</p><p id="Par123">The nature of bi-directional citation chasing suggests that, given the relative specificity, this method could possibly be used to efficiently update systematic reviews using known includes as the citations to chase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Researchers have had positive, although incomplete, success trialling this method, and studies suggest that citation chasing alone is not a substitute for standard update searches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Handsearching</title><p id="Par124">The evidence on handsearching can be summarised as (1) selecting where to handsearch, (2) what to handsearch and (3) who does the handsearching. In relation to 1, the handbooks advocate selecting journals to handsearch on the basis of the number of relevant studies included from journals identified in database searching. This approach means handsearching is a supplementary method to database searching, since to undertake handsearching&#x02014;following this method&#x02014;database searches define the list of journals to handsearch.</p><p id="Par125">Studies included in this review provided empirical evidence that handsearching journals identified by database searching was effective in identifying studies missed by poor indexing, lack of study design or omission of key search terms, or where sections of journals are not indexed on databases. In this way, this approach to selecting journals to handsearch could be categorised as a &#x02018;safety net search&#x02019;, since it aims to identify studies missed by deficiencies in literature searching and database indexing. This approach to selecting journals to handsearch, even though it is effective, could be argued to be a duplication of effort, since the journals being handsearched have already been &#x02018;searched&#x02019; through the bibliographic databases. This is likely why the studies recorded low precision (compared to database searches) and why handsearching takes longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par126">The Cochrane Handbook and three studies suggested alternative ways to identify journals to handsearch: namely, selecting journals not indexed on MEDLINE or EMBASE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]&#x02014;a suggestion that is easily changed to read &#x02018;primary databases&#x02019; relevant to the field of study (i.e. ERIC for reviews of educational topics)&#x02014;and contacting experts, contacting organisations and searches of library shelves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Neither the study by Armstrong et al. nor the study by Langham et al. listed the journals identified by method of identification, so it is not clear if there were differences between the list of journals provided by experts when compared to those provided by databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This review did not identify any studies that compared the use of databases to identify journals to handsearch as against these alternative methods but such a study may be of value if efficiencies could be found in practice.</p><p id="Par127">It may be that, in reviews in which a comprehensive identification of studies is required, identifying journals to handsearch should be done both by using databases and contacting experts or organisations. The former being to cover any deficiencies in the database searching and the latter to capture any unique journals or conferences known to experts but not indexed in databases.</p><p id="Par128">Selecting what to handsearch and who should handsearch was another notable difference between the handbooks and studies. The studies included in this review identified studies uniquely from handsearching various sections of journals (from abstracts through to book reviews), and the studies used volunteers, provided training to handsearchers, and used experienced handsearchers to handsearch, with varying degrees of success and failure since handsearching relates to effectively identifying studies when compared to database searching. The Cochrane Collaboration arguably has one of the longest track-records of handsearching projects (c/f [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]), and it is their recommendation that handsearching is the page-by-page examination of the entire contents of a journal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] by a well-trained handsearcher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Handsearching is commonly referred to and used as a &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; comparator to establish effectiveness of other search methods. Given that every study included in this review uniquely identified studies by handsearching but also missed studies by handsearching too, a reminder of what constitutes handsearching is likely warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Trial registers</title><p id="Par129">The handbooks provide guidance on where to search and the studies focused on the effectiveness of study identification in selected registers and/or the practicalities of searching registers. In this way, the studies advance the guidance of the handbooks, since they provide empirically derived case-studies of searching the registers. The implications for searching, however, are clear: searching trial registers should still be undertaken in combination with bibliographic database searching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Even despite the aims of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], comprehensive and prospective registration of trials&#x02014;and keeping the trial data up to date&#x02014;is still not common place. It is unclear what pressure (if any) is put upon trial managers who do not prospectively register their trials and, in fact, if there is any active penalty if trial managers do not do so. Until this issue is resolved, the comprehension of registers will remain uncertain and a combination of bibliographic database searching (to identify published trials) and searches of trial registers (to identify recruiting, on-going or completed trials) is required.</p><p id="Par130">The advantages of searching trial registers are worthy of discussion. Registered trials include an e-mail address for trial managers, which can facilitate author contact, and the studies concluded that more consistent searching of trial registers may improve identification of publication and outcome reporting bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. If trial managers were using the portals correctly, it would also be a practical method of reporting results and sharing study data, perhaps akin to a &#x02018;project website&#x02019;, as recommend in the Cochrane Handbook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The variability of the search interfaces is notably a disadvantage and something upon which could be improved. Glanville et al. observed that the search interfaces lag behind major bibliographic databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. If the registers themselves are hard to search (and in some cases impossible to export data from), they are less likely to be searched. Trial managers and information specialists/researchers could usefully work together with the registers to develop the interfaces in order to meet the needs of all who use them. The use of trial registers may be broader than only researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Web searching</title><p id="Par131">In their 2001 study, Eysenbach et al. stated that the role of the internet for identifying studies for systematic reviews is less clear when compared to other methods of study identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The handbooks do not update this view, and very few studies were identified in this review which improve upon Eysenbach et al.&#x02019;s claim. The studies have attempted to take on Eysenbach et al.&#x02019;s suggestion that a systematic investigation to evaluate the usefulness of the internet for locating evidence is needed. Mahood et al., however, had to abandon their attempts to web-search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], but Godin et al. took this work a little further in their case study with reference to identifying grey literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par132">The comparative lack of guidance in the handbooks could stem either from a lack of certain knowledge of how to web-search or perhaps a lack of certainty of how to do this systematically, such that web searching could be replicable, and therefore, be included as a method to identify studies without introducing bias. Researchers are exploring the idea of how far web searching can meet the need to be replicable and transparent but still functional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Further guidance is undoubtedly needed on this supplementary search method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par133">The date range and age of the handbooks and studies included in this review could be considered a limitation of this study.</p><p id="Par134">Comparative and non-comparative case studies form the evidence base for this study. The studies included in this review have been taken at face-value, and no formal quality appraisal has been undertaken since no suitable tool exists. Furthermore, supplementary search methods are typically evaluated in the context of effectiveness, which is potentially a limited test of the contribution they may offer in the process of study identification. Different thresholds of effectiveness and efficiency may apply in the use of supplementary search methods in systematic reviews of qualitative studies when compared to reviews of RCTs, for example.</p><p id="Par135">The studies themselves do not necessarily correlate to the concepts of claimed advantages and disadvantages. In most cases, proposed advantages and disadvantages have not been tested in practice.</p><p id="Par136">Whilst we have aimed to comprehensively identify and review studies for inclusion, the use of supplementary search methods is a broad field of study and it is possible that some completed studies may have been inadvertently missed or overlooked. It is possible that standard systematic review techniques, such as double-screening, would have minimised this risk, but we are confident that, whilst a more systematic approach may have improved the rigour of the study, it is unlikely to alter the conclusions below.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par137">Current supplementary search practice aligns methodologically with recommended best practice. The search methods as recommended in the handbooks are perceptibly the same methods as used in the studies identified in this review. The difference between the handbooks and the studies is of purpose: the studies sought to test the search methods or tools used to undertake the search methods.</p><p id="Par138">The causal inference between methods (as presented in the handbooks) and results (as found in the studies) could be usefully tested to develop our understanding of these supplementary search methods. Further research is needed to better understand these search methods. Specifically, consistency in measuring outcomes, so the results can be generalised and trends identified, which would provide a link not only to better effectiveness data but also to efficiency data, offers researchers a better understanding of the value of using these search methods, or not.</p><sec id="Sec49"><title>Time</title><p id="Par139">All of the studies discussed in this review claimed to identify additional includable material for their reviews using supplementary search methods that would have been missed using database searches alone. Few of the studies, however, reported the resources required to identify these unique studies. Further, none of the studies used a common framework or provided information that allows a common metric to be calculated. It is not, therefore, possible to compare the resources required to identify any extra study with each search method. This, alongside the use of comparative and non-comparative case studies as the primary study design to test effectiveness, limits our ability to generalise the results of the studies and so reliably interpret the broader efficiency of these search methods. Researchers could usefully consider reporting the amount of time taken to undertake each search method in their search reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Value versus impact?</title><p id="Par140">Identifying unique studies is commonly interpreted as adding value to the review and the process of searching in and of itself. Only three studies sought to extend this, appraising either the quality of the studies identified or the contribution of the studies to the synthesis as a way of considering the value of the additional studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In reviews of effectiveness, where all studies should be identified so as to generate a reliable estimate of effect, study value might be a moot point but, in resource-limited situations, or for reviews where a comprehensive identification of studies is less important, study value is an important metric in understanding the contribution of supplementary search methods and the extent to which researchers invest time in undertaking them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec51"><title>Time + value</title><p id="Par141">Comparing the time taken to search, with a summary estimate of the contribution or value of the studies identified uniquely, against the total number of studies identified, could alter how researchers value supplementary searches. It would permit some basic form of retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis, which would ultimately move literature searching beyond simply claiming that more studies were identified to explaining what studies were identified, at what cost and to what value.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par10">Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par101"> Eysenbach et al. recommend Alta Vista but this search engine no longer exists.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>CC is grateful to Danica Cooper for her proof-reading and comments.
