Of a total of ten carcinomas found in six patients, six showed DNA aneuploidy. Three patients developed metastatic carcinomas, all with aneuploid cell populations with similar DNA indices as in the primary carcinoma. Furthermore, aneuploid cell populations with similar DNA indices often occurred, both in separate mucosa samples, as well as in mucosa and carcinoma samples, from the same patient. DNA aneuploidy was found in flat mucosa in five of the six patients with carcinoma, and in one of the four patients without carcinoma (P greater than 0.1). High grade dysplasia was found in only four of the six cases with carcinoma, indicating that high grade dysplasia is insufficient as marker for malignant development. DNA aneuploidy was found in 24% of the dysplastic mucosa samples, and in 18% of the non-dysplastic mucosa samples (n.s., both with regard to high and low grade dysplasia). Since abnormal DNA ploidy pattern was not confined to dysplastic epithelium only, DNA aneuploidy in flat mucosa may constitute an additional marker in the identification of patients at increased cancer risk who could benefit from a closer surveillance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="339" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="340" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="341" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="342" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="343" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00072-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="344" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
