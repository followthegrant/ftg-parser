In this study, we sought to determine fine antigen (Ag) specificities of CD8 T cells that target LS malaria parasites. Guided by algorithms for predicting MHC class I-restricted epitopes, we ranked sequences of 32 Pb LS Ags and selected ~400 peptides restricted by mouse H-2K<sup>b</sup> and H-2D<sup>b</sup> alleles for analysis in the high-throughput method of caged MHC class I-tetramer technology. We identified a 9-mer H-2K<sup>b</sup> restricted CD8 T cell epitope, Kb-17, which specifically recognized and activated CD8 T cell responses in B6 mice immunized with Pb radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS) and challenged with infectious sporozoites (spz). The Kb-17 peptide is derived from the recently described novel protective Pb LS Ag, PBANKA_1031000 (MIF4G-like protein). Notably, immunization with the Kb-17 epitope delivered in the form of a minigene in the adenovirus serotype 5 vector reduced LPB in mice infected with spz. On the basis of our results, Kb-17 peptide was available for CD8 T cell activation and recall following immunization with Pb RAS and challenge with infectious spz. The identification of a novel MHC class I-restricted epitope from the protective Pb LS Ag, MIF4G-like protein, is crucial for advancing our understanding of immune responses to Plasmodium and by extension, toward vaccine development against malaria.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CD8 T cells</kwd><kwd>epitope prediction</kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium</italic></kwd><kwd>caged MHC-tetramers</kwd><kwd>minigene</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">U.S. Army Materiel Command<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100006753</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="9370"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria remains one of the most serious infectious diseases that plagues residents of tropical areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Each year, more than 200 million cases of malaria, mainly caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (Pf), are reported, with more than 400,000 deaths occurring annually (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). An effective malaria vaccine is still unavailable. The most advanced malaria vaccine, RTS,S, based on the Pf circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the major sporozoite (spz) surface antigen (Ag), induces but a modicum of protection from clinical malaria and protection is short-lived (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). According to the majority of results from studies of immune responses induced by RTS,S, there appears to be an absence of CSP-specific CD8 T cells (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and that alone may limit the effectiveness of the vaccine. Therefore, addition of antigenic targets to the CSP-based vaccine, and particularly liver stage (LS) Ags that would be targeted by CD8 T cells, might rescue the modest efficacy of the otherwise well designed RTS,S vaccine.</p><p>There are many examples from animal (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) as well as human studies (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) that protection induced with radiation-attenuated sporozoite (RAS), the gold standard of protection, is CD8 T cell-dependent. The major sporozoite stage (SS) Ag, CSP, plays a role in RAS induced protection and results from studies with CSP-peptide TCR Tg CD8 T cells confirmed this notion (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Results from separately conducted studies have demonstrated that TRAP peptide also induces CD8 T cells that eliminate LS parasites (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). We have demonstrated that protracted protection induced by Pb RAS depends on LS Ag-specific effector and memory CD8 T cells (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). On the basis of results from an elegantly conducted study using Pb CSP-tolerized mice, it became evident that protection induced with RAS occurs in the absence of CSP-specific T cells and that it is mediated by immune responses induced by other pre-erythrocytic (PE) Ags (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Collectively, these observations highlight the importance of many PE Ags including CSP, TRAP, and LS Ags in the generation of protection (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and support the notion that intracellular parasite Ags, presumably expressed during LS development, are targets of immunity.</p><p>Using transcriptome data of LS forms of Pf parasites, we identified genes that are over-transcribed in LS parasites compared with either blood stage or SS (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Importantly, we demonstrated that some <italic>P. berghei</italic> (Pb) orthologs of those Pf genes significantly reduce Pb LS parasite burden (LPB) in C57Bl/6 (B6) mice immunized with plasmid DNA delivered by the Gene Gun. The immune mechanisms that mediate LPB reduction are not fully understood, but in some instances are dependent on CD8 T cells, as depletion of CD8 T cells prior to spz challenge limits LPB reduction. We also showed that immunization with Pb or <italic>P.&#x02009;yoelii</italic> (Py) CSP combined with select LS Ags enhances protection in comparison with CSP alone (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In the current study, we set out to identify MHC class I-restricted epitopes derived from the novel Pb LS Ags and to evaluate if such epitopes might contribute to protective immunity against spz challenge.</p><p>Given the size of the Plasmodium genome and the expression of unique antigenic proteins at each stage, it is not surprising that immunodominant epitopes for CD8 T cells have been difficult to identify. Detection of Ag-specific CD8 T cells became more direct and less laborious with the development of caged MHC-tetramer technology (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Briefly, this method is based on the design of conditional MHC class I ligands that form stable complexes with MHC molecules but degrade under UV light. This generates &#x0201c;empty&#x0201d; MHC molecules that can be loaded with other peptides. The newly formed MHC:peptide complexes can be used to monitor MHC class I-restricted peptide-specific CD8 T cell responses. This technology has been used to identify new MHC class I-restricted epitopes from viruses (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), bacteria (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and parasites (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We hypothesized that application of caged MHC class I-tetramer technology might uncover LS-derived epitopes specific for CD8 T cells involved in protection against malaria.</p><p>We have now identified a CD8 T cell epitope, Kb-17, contained within one of our recently described novel protective Pb LS Ags (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). CD8 T cells specific for Kb-17, identified by the caged tetramer technology, were detectable in mice immunized with Pb RAS and recalled following Pb spz challenge. Importantly, immune responses induced with Kb-17 conferred protection characterized by the reduction of Pb LPB. Identification of Kb-17 as a protective epitope not only underscores the role of LS Ag-specific CD8 T cell responses in protective immunity against LS parasites, but also establishes these responses as correlates of protection against malaria infection in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All procedures were reviewed and approved by WRAIR/NMRC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol # 15-MVD-30) and were performed in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and in accordance with the principles set forth in the &#x0201c;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,&#x0201d; Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources, National Research Council, National Academy Press, 2011.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Parasites</title><p><italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> (ANKA strain) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and luciferase-expressing Pb (Pb-luc) (ANKA strain) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) spz were maintained by cyclical transmission in mice and <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes.

Because the Kb-17-recalled IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cell responses and Kb-17-Tet<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells rose after Pb RAS immunization and were recalled following challenge, we hypothesized that Kb-17-specific CD8 T cells may be involved in mediating, at least partially, protective immune responses to Pb spz challenge. We used the constructed plasmid DNA encoding PBANKA_1031000 gene (pCI-1031) and Ad5 expressing Kb-17 peptide as a minigene (Ad5-Kb-17) to test this hypothesis in our experimental model system. We compared two immunization schedules: DNA prime/Ad5 boost and Ad5 prime/DNA boost, delivering 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;g of plasmid DNA and 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup> ifu of Ad5 i.v. with 6&#x02009;weeks interval between prime and boost immunization regimen. To determine if this immunization strategy induced protection as defined by a reduction of LPB, mice were immunized as described above and challenged with 10&#x02009;K Pb spz 14&#x02009;days after the last boost and LPB was determined by qPCR at ~40&#x02009;h after the challenge (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Immunization of mice with pCI-1031 DNA and Ad5-Kb-17 significantly reduced LPB in B6 mice infected with Pb spz when compared with EV DNA/Ad5 null immunized control mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Priming with Ad5 and boosting with DNA also conferred protection, however, less effective, albeit not statistically significant. <italic>In vitro</italic> stimulation of IHMC and splenocytes from mice vaccinated with pCI-1031 DNA and Ad5-Kb-17 recalled robust IFN-&#x003b3; production, whereas no IFN-&#x003b3; responses were observed in mice vaccinated with Ad5-Kb-17 plus pCI-1031 DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B,C). The absence of IFN-&#x003b3; responses was surprising; one possibility is that the time lapse from the Ad5-Kb-17 priming to the time of T cell analyses caused the Kb-17-specific cells to contract to the point that were not recalled with the peptide. In this case, the DNA boost immunization was insufficient to induce and maintain the IFN-&#x003b3;-producing Kb-17-specific T cells. Pb TRAP<sub>130</sub> peptide stimulated cultures resulted in negative IFN-&#x003b3; responses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B,C).

Clearly, this protein gained an entry into the MHC class I presentation pathways, as Kb-17 peptide recalled IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cell responses and Kb-17-Tet<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells were detectable in spleens and livers from Pb RAS-immunized mice. Importantly, kinetics studies showed that Kb-17-Tet<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells were detected in the livers and spleens of Pb RAS-immunized/Pb spz challenged mice. This implies that the MIF4G-like protein was expressed during LS development following infection with spz and was processed by the TAP-dependent pathway. We have previously demonstrated that while LS Ags derived from Pb RAS could be processed by either or both TAP-dependent as well as TAP-independent pathways, the recall of effector CD8 T cells during challenge with infectious spz is TAP-dependent; unlike WT mice, Pb RAS-immunized TAP deficient mice are not protected and CD8 T cells remain unresponsive to infectious spz challenge, although CD8 T cells are activated by Pb RAS immunization (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). We therefore propose that the Pb MIF4G-like protein was available to enter Ag processing and presentation pathways and the resulting Kb-17 peptide either bound to nascent MHC class I molecules in the ER (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) or to the recycling MHC class I molecules in phagosomal-endosomal compartment of Ag presenting cell (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) was available for both the activation and recall of protective CD8 T cells.</p><p>The Kb-17-Tet<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells as well as IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD8 T cells induced by whole parasite RAS immunization declined sharply shortly after spz challenge. Likely, this resulted from a surge of inflammatory cytokines released in response to infectious spz. IFN-&#x003b3; in particular enhances cellular attrition owing to apoptosis of effector CD8 T cells that show elevated expression of IFN-&#x003b3;R after infections with Pb spz (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Both the level of Kb-17-Tet<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells as well as the Kb-17 recalled IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD8 T cells returned to pre-challenge levels at 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;weeks after the challenge. The ability of Kb-17-specific CD8 T cells to mediate a reduction of LPB in response to spz challenge underscores the importance of the LS Ags derived from spz. Collectively, these observations lend support to the notion that LS Ags do induce protective CD8 T cells and as such, these Ags should be considered as a strategy to be included with SS Ags, CSP, or TRAP, as a viable option for an improved malaria vaccine.</p><p>Based on the size of Plasmodium genome ~23&#x02009;Mb (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), a large number of CD8 T cell epitopes should be available for binding to MHC class I molecules to form MHC:peptide complexes for activation of CD8 T cells. Despite many years of research devoted to finding epitopes of Ag-specific T cells involved in protective immunity, currently there are but a few known mouse MHC class I-restricted Pb epitopes derived from the PE stage that induce IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cell responses and confer protective immunity: H-2<sup>d</sup> restricted epitope PbCSP<sub>253&#x02013;261</sub> (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) and H-2<sup>b</sup> restricted PbTRAP<sub>130&#x02013;138</sub> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Multiple factors may account for the difficulties in finding more CD8 T cell epitopes among the many different proteins expressed during the entire PE stage and particularly the LS. The initial peptide selection for the tetramer formation was based on <italic>in silico</italic> determinations and this in itself contains inherent limitations, as only certain algorithm-dictated binders are selected to be included in the pool of epitopes for testing and no allowances are made for post-translationally modified epitopes. In accordance with this approach, many potential epitopes are rejected owing to hierarchical estimates of MHC class I binding scores. Similar to our findings with ~400 peptides assayed in the tetramer binding assay, others have shown that only two peptides, from a pool of 600 overlapping 8&#x02013;10-mer peptides used for stimulations, recognize and activate CD8 T cells derived from immunization with RAS (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, the abundance of proteins expressed during the LS (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) may give rise to a rather large number of peptides competing for binding to and occupancy of the MHC class I molecules in the ER or in other cellular compartments where a peptide exchange may be occurring. On the basis of the H-2<sup>b</sup> binding indices, it appears that Pb LS Ag peptides display lower scores than PbCSP<sub>253&#x02013;261</sub> peptide. This may lead to a failure of many LS Ag peptides to associate with MHC or the formed MHC:peptide complexes may be unstable, which would preclude their export to the surface of APCs. According to this scenario, stable MHC class I:peptide complexes with a strong affinity for the TCR would be infrequent, which may explain the rather weak CD8 T cell responses that have been noted in previous studies describing responses to malaria Ags (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). In comparison with the percentage of tetramer positive CD8 T cells observed in viral (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) infections, the levels observed in our studies are rather low. The paucity of MHC class I epitopes detected from the LS parasites could also be attributed to the short duration of this stage. During infection, effector CD8 T cells must be recalled swiftly and therefore, effector CD8 T cells may recognize only the most abundant and most available MHC:peptide complexes on target cells. It is also possible that the Plasmodium parasite may have developed a strategy for avoiding generation of peptides by the virtue of not having easily accessible cleavage sites on the potentially antigenic proteins.</p><p>In summary, we identified a novel protective CD8 T cell epitope, Kb-17, from the protective LS Ag, PBANKA_1031000. We expect that the identification of this epitope will provide much needed information to advance our understanding of the requirements of specific CD8 T cells for the induction and maintenance of lasting protection against malaria and will serve as a tool to manipulate CD8 T cell responses to enhance protective immunity. Identification of PBANKA_1031000 as a target of protective CD8 T cell responses in the Pb-B6 model strongly supports testing of its Pf ortholog, PF3D7_1411500, as a potential vaccine candidate against malaria.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All procedures were reviewed and approved by WRAIR/NMRC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol # 15-MVD-30) and were performed in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and in accordance with the principles set forth in the &#x0201c;Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,&#x0201d; Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources, National Research Council, National Academy Press, 2011.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>AP and UK conception or design of the work.
