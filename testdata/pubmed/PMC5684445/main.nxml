To achieve gene delivery of plasmids encoding dysferlin to hind limb muscles of dysferlin knockout mice, we used a vascular injection method that perfused naked plasmid DNA into all major muscle groups of the hind limb. We monitored delivery by luciferase live imaging and western blot, confirming strong dysferlin expression that persisted over the 3-month time course of the experiment. Co-delivery of the follistatin gene, which may promote muscle growth, was monitored by ELISA. Immunohistochemistry documented the presence of dysferlin in muscle fibers in treated limbs, and PCR confirmed the presence of plasmid DNA. Because dysferlin is involved in repair of the sarcolemmal membrane, dysferlin loss leads to fragile sarcolemmal membranes that can be detected by permeability to Evan&#x02019;s blue dye. We showed that after gene therapy with a plasmid encoding both dysferlin and follistatin, statistically significant reduction in Evan&#x02019;s blue dye permeability was present in hamstring muscles. These results suggest that vascular delivery of plasmids carrying these therapeutic genes may lead to simple and effective approaches for improving the clinical condition of limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>dysferlin</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>naked DNA</kwd><kwd>follistatin</kwd><kwd>gene therapy</kwd><kwd>limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">There are over 50 forms of hereditary muscular dystrophy due to mutations in different genes affecting muscle function.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Most of these disease genes are recessive, making these disorders candidates for gene therapy by addition of a functional copy of the gene that is mutated.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> One of these recessive muscular dystrophies is limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B), caused by deficiency of dysferlin,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> a protein involved in repair of the sarcolemmal membrane.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Mutations in the gene for dysferlin (<italic>DYSF</italic>) lead to a degenerative disorder of skeletal muscle, centered on muscles of the pelvic and shoulder girdles, with progressive involvement of distal limb muscles.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p id="p0015">Mouse models that lack dysferlin are available and have been used to demonstrate gene therapy for LGMD2B using a gene delivery strategy based on adeno-associated virus (AAV).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Although promising results have been achieved in these studies, they also highlight some of the challenges of an AAV-mediated approach for LGMD2B. The dysferlin coding sequence is 6.2 kb long, but AAV is unable to package genes longer than 5 kb. Therefore, dual vector strategies<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> or deleted forms of dysferlin<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> have been used, which may reduce the efficiency or effectiveness of the therapy. In addition, an AAV gene therapy strategy presents problems with vector immunogenicity,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> vector loss, and the challenges and expense of large-scale viral vector production. The use of plasmid DNA as a vector could address these challenges because plasmid DNA has no size limit, is not immunogenic, is produced at a lower cost, and has the potential to integrate into the genome if an integration mechanism is provided.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p id="p0020">Jon Wolff and colleagues<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> showed in 1990 that plasmid DNA provided surprisingly high levels of persistent gene expression when the DNA was introduced by intramuscular injection in mouse muscles. In order to deliver the DNA more broadly to multiple muscles, the Wolff group developed a method they called hydrodynamic limb vein injection.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> In this method, the hind limb circulation was transiently blocked by a tourniquet near the hip joint. Naked DNA was injected into the saphenous vein near the ankle joint in a volume of saline buffer sufficient to cause exit of the fluid and DNA from the blood vessels. This process of extravasation placed the DNA in direct contact with muscle fibers, where it was taken up and transcribed, leading to significant levels of delivered protein in the muscle fibers. The delivery process was simple, fast, and safe and lead to transfection of approximately 10% of muscle fibers in a single dose. Furthermore, the process could be repeated at intervals to build up incremental levels of therapeutic protein.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The method was translated to monkey limbs with similar efficiency,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and the fluid delivery procedure was found to be safe and well tolerated in muscular dystrophy patients,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> suggesting the possibility of clinical translation.</p><p id="p0025">We experimented here with plasmid DNA-mediated vascular delivery in a mouse model of LGMD2B.

In this study, we experiment with plasmid-mediated delivery of dysferlin or dysferlin plus follistatin in a mouse model of LGMD2B, assaying levels and distribution of gene expression by luciferase live imaging, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA, presence of plasmid DNA by PCR, and benefit to muscle by the Evan&#x02019;s blue dye (EBD) assay of muscle membrane permeability.

Introducing the DNA in a volume of&#x000a0;&#x0223c;1&#x000a0;mL to the leg in the presence of the tourniquet forced the fluid to exit the vasculature, where the plasmid DNA came in contact with muscle fibers, which are competent to take up naked DNA. Successful delivery was monitored by observing transient swelling of the limb as well as distribution of the blue dye that was included in the injection fluid.

As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B, a strong PCR band was detected in legs that received plasmid DNA, but not in those that received only HBSS buffer, verifying the existence of plasmid DNA in these muscles. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C, levels of follistatin were significantly higher in muscles that received pDYSF-FST compared to those receiving pDYSF or HBSS, which reflected only the basal level of endogenous follistatin present in mouse muscles.</p><p id="p0070">To analyze whether we could detect any improvement in the condition of the treated muscles, we injected Evan&#x02019;s blue dye into the mice intraperitoneally 1&#x000a0;day before harvest of the muscles in the 12-week experiment. Evan&#x02019;s blue dye is able to enter muscle fibers only if their sarcolemma is permeable, a condition increasingly present with progression of LGMD2B due to the membrane repair defect present in dysferlin-deficient muscle fibers. We showed that the hamstring muscle was the most permeable hind limb muscle to Evan&#x02019;s blue dye at age matching of these mice.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> When the gastrocnemius and hamstring muscles were analyzed for levels of Evan&#x02019;s blue dye, we found a trend downward in the treated muscles, with a statistically significant drop in Evan&#x02019;s blue dye uptake present in hamstring muscles treated with pDYSF-FST (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>D). Furthermore, the animal-to-animal variability, as determined by F&#x000a0;test, was also lower in muscles that received pDYSF-FST, and this difference was statistically significant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0075">In this study, we demonstrated a gene therapy using naked plasmid DNA that distributed substantial amounts of therapeutic protein to hind limb muscles in a mouse model of LGMD2B. By performing a relatively simple procedure of vascular injection of DNA in the presence of a tourniquet to block circulation transiently, amounts of therapeutic dysferlin protein approaching or exceeding normal levels were detected in hind limb muscles by western blot 3&#x000a0;months after treatment. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of dysferlin in muscle fibers, and PCR confirmed the presence of plasmid DNA. Luciferase live imaging provided a convenient surrogate marker to evaluate the strength and durability of gene expression of the delivered genes.</p><p id="p0080">Previously, this vascular delivery method had been applied to <italic>mdx</italic>&#x000a0;mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy by the Wolff group.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Generally, similar results were seen in the levels of gene expression observed and the preferential delivery to similar muscle groups, including the gastrocnemius and hamstring. In those studies, plasmids expressing full-length dystrophin provided stable dystrophin expression for the lifetime of the mice.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Protection from Evan&#x02019;s blue dye permeability was seen when about 20% of normal levels of dystrophin were present, distributed among 11%&#x02013;16% of fibers.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Repeat delivery was used to increase the amount of dystrophin protein and percentage of dystrophin-expressing fibers. Repeated delivery was found to increase the therapeutic protein level in a linear fashion, whereas the number of fibers transfected rose at a slower rate,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> presumably due to repeat delivery to some fibers, perhaps due to their proximity to blood vessels. Our results show that this methodology can be extended to other forms of muscular dystrophy, with similar results.</p><p id="p0085">This approach contrasts with the current focus on AAV-mediated delivery for muscle gene therapy. Because it is uncertain whether the AAV approach will be sufficient, developing alternative gene therapy strategies may offer valuable options for patients. The primary advantage of the AAV system is that it can provide for efficient delivery to tissues via a receptor-mediated process involving the viral capsid that has often worked well in mice. By the same token, the presence of a viral capsid of fixed dimensions and composed of foreign proteins also creates limitations. Plasmid DNA has no size limit and, as demonstrated here, can accommodate the full-length dysferlin coding sequence. By contrast, AAV is a small, packaged virus with a fixed size limit of &#x0223c;4.7 kb. The full-length dysferlin coding sequence is 6.2 kb long and will not fit in AAV vectors. As a result, partial dysferlin sequences or dual vector approaches that require recombination in recipient cells are being used in AAV gene therapy development for dysferlinopathy.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, dual vector approaches compromise efficiency and increase complexity, whereas partial fragments of the protein may have only partial activity. Use of the full-length coding sequence is more desirable and feasible with the plasmid system.</p><p id="p0090">Another potential advantage of the plasmid system is lesser immune response. The AAV capsid stimulates an immune response in humans, and most humans have pre-existing antibodies to AAV, which may complicate treatment by inactivation of incoming virus.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Moreover, after an AAV-based gene therapy is administered, a neutralizing antibody response to the AAV capsid may interfere with further treatment. The need for re-treatment is likely for muscular dystrophy because the muscle target is large and AAV gene therapy may not be permanent. By contrast, it has been shown that plasmid can be re-administered multiple times.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p id="p0095">An additional potential advantage of a plasmid system is the ability to integrate the plasmid covalently into the genome, for example, by using phiC31 integrase or another integration system.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Integrated plasmid DNA becomes a permanent part of the genome, which may prolong therapeutic gene expression. Lack of integration of most of the AAV vector population means that therapeutic gene expression could diminish over time. AAV also has little ability to correct muscle stem cells, which are dividing cells that rapidly lose unintegrated DNA.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Ease of manufacture is another potential advantage of a plasmid system. It is relatively easy and cheap to make plasmid DNA from bacteria. By contrast, the viral manufacturing and purification process is time consuming and expensive. A potential disadvantage of plasmid delivery is less efficient delivery. However, it should be noted that although AAV delivery in mouse muscle is efficient, it may be less efficient in humans due to a larger size and more potent immune response. A conceivable potential strategy is to administer an initial dose of AAV vector to achieve widespread coverage, followed by vascular injection of plasmid to boost expression over time.</p><p id="p0100">Our results suggest that a large amount of dysferlin protein was made in a subset of fibers. It remains possible that low levels of dysferlin expression in additional fibers were obscured by the strong expression in some fibers. This uneven distribution of therapeutic protein may not be ideal for the types of structural or enzymatic proteins involved in many forms of muscular dystrophy. On the other hand, this pattern of distribution is attractive for delivery of secreted proteins. Follistatin is a small, conserved protein that is secreted locally and binds to and inhibits myostatin, a transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) family member that is expressed almost exclusively in developing and mature muscle and acts to shut down muscle growth.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Follistatin can stimulate muscle growth even in myostatin null mice by inhibiting additional TGF-&#x003b2; family members, including activin.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> The 344-aa isoform of human <italic>FST</italic> that we used here has been tested in a human clinical trial that claimed a possible therapeutic benefit in Becker muscular dystrophy patients.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Favorable distribution of locally secreted follistatin by the vascular delivery method we employed may help explain why the plasmid that encoded both dysferlin and follistatin appeared to be more therapeutically effective than a plasmid with dysferlin alone.</p><p id="p0105">Expression of dysferlin in 100% of fibers is not required for clinical efficacy. For example, in a study of delivery of a truncated dysferlin gene with AAV, systemic delivery led to expression of dysferlin in&#x000a0;&#x0223c;10% of muscle fibers in the gluteal muscles, but this was sufficient for histological and functional recovery.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Although plasmid delivery to muscle by this vascular method is restricted to the area delineated by the tourniquet and does not include the heart, the heart is rarely affected in LGMD2B<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and is not a critical target in this disorder. Furthermore, cardiac avoidance is an asset in some forms of muscular dystrophy, like LGMD2A, in which expression of the therapeutic calpain3 protein is toxic in the heart.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref></p><p id="p0110">In follow-up studies, it would be advantageous to treat younger animals and wait a longer period of time before evaluation. Such a protocol would provide a more rigorous test of safety and might result in more dramatic results from the gene therapy, permitting documentation of clinical benefits through muscle function testing. Furthermore, immune-competent Bl/AJ mice will be used in order to help predict any immune response resulting from therapeutic plasmids, from which marker genes such as luciferase will be removed. It is also of interest to test delivery of follistatin alone to better evaluate the benefit we saw in this study of a plasmid carrying both dysferlin and follistatin. It would be informative to evaluate muscle mass in those studies because increase in muscle mass is a documented feature of follistatin activity.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It may also be beneficial to employ genomic integration of the plasmid.
