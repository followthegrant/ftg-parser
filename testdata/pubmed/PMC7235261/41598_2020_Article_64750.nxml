Slip-rates, a key factor for understanding neotectonics and seismic hazard are only available there from geodetic models. In this study, we present the first direct geologic evidence of MFS slip rates. Late-Cenozoic slip rates along the main MF is 5.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.3&#x02009;mm/yr based on lithologic geological separations found in regional mapping. Late-Quaternary deformation from offset geomorphologic markers was documented along the MFS in Chile and Argentina based on a combination of satellite mapping, fieldwork, and Structure from Motion (SfM) models developed from drone photography. By combining displacements observed in SfM models with regional Late-Quaternary dating, sinistral slip rates are 10.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.5&#x02009;mm/yr (Chile) and 7.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3&#x02009;mm/yr (Argentina). By comparing our results with regional models, contemporary plate boundary deformation is narrow, approximately ~20&#x02013;50&#x02009;km wide from Tierra Del Fuego (TdF) and east (one of the narrowest on Earth), which widens and becoming more diffuse from Cabo Froward north and west (&#x0003e;100&#x02009;km wide).

At the southern end of South American, the Patagonian Andes is characterized by the curvature of the Fuegian belt, which bends from an N-S trending structural trend (at ~53&#x000b0;15&#x02032;S) to a more W-E strike along the Island of Tierra Del Fuego<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> (TdF; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There, a continental-scale system of transform faults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> called the either the Magallanes-Fagnano Fault System or Magallanes Fault System<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> (MFS), accommodates sinistral (left-lateral) motion along the plate boundary between the Scotia and South American Plates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

To date, faults within the MFS are poorly mapped or concealed due to being submarine or found within dense forest (except further to the east of TdF), with slip rate estimates only derived from modeling. Slip rate estimations from geodetic data are based on a limited number of GPS stations over limited timeframes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; 6.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3&#x02009;mm/yr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>; 5.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2&#x02009;mm/yr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>; 9.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.4&#x02009;mm/yr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>). This demonstrates the need for geological data to better understand long-term neotectonics along this plate boundary and evaluate the geophysical models.

The absence of data is likely because much of the fault system is submarine or below lakes, only ~65&#x02009;km of the MFS are onshore in Chile and ~60&#x02009;km in Argentina respectively, or hidden within dense forest (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Other authors suggest that the development of the current plate boundary, the MFS-NSR, occurred later due to the onset of seafloor spreading in the western Scotia Sea and the opening of Drake Passage in the Eocene-Oligocene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. According to this model, the strike-slip deformation in TdF started after 30&#x02009;Ma, superimposing the contractional deformation dominant during the Cretaceous. On the other hand, AMS dataset shows that from at least the Early Cretaceous until the end of the Oligocene the tectonic regime at the Southern Andes yielded continuous contraction, implying that the uplift and exhumation of the Cordillera Darwin occurred within a compressive regional tectonic regime, rather than in a strike-slip setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Between 46 to 20&#x02009;Ma, the spreading rates in the Western Scotia ridge increased, changed to an WNW-ESE direction, resulting in a transpression along the Northern Scotia Ridge (NSR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.<sup>.</sup> At 20&#x02009;Ma, a change in the motion to an W-E direction lead to the initiation of spreading at the East Scotia Ridge, and thus the onset of MFS and an important drop in the spreading rates on the West Scotia Ridge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, MFS-NSR transform system development may have initiated at ~6 Ma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, coeval with cessation of western Scotia seafloor spreading and a significant increase in the Eastern Scotia ridge activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which led to the current plate geometry with the inactive West Scotia Ridge and ongoing sinistral motion.</p><p id="Par5">Individual faults within the MFS in TdF around Lake Fagnano (which is also called Lake Cami in Chile) are mapped and defined based on seismic profiles interpretation and bathymetric data and regional mapping.

Thus we can infer that the most recent event along the DF occurred post 1680 because these trees found on this shutter ridge are tilted and damaged (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), specifically there are trees that are broken and growing diagonal from the surface. By combining the slip rates of three known active strands of the MFS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>; i.e. MF, HF, DF) at this location in Chile gives a combined MFS strike slip slip rate of at least 10.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.5&#x02009;mm/yr. Are there active MFS faults north and parallel to the DF? This remains unknown. Interestingly based on GPS velocities and modelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the faults mapped south the HF are believed to not be active within onshore TdF. Being that the slip rate in Argentina is slightly slower at 7.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3&#x02009;mm/yr suggests that perhaps other sub-parallel faults to the MF are likely accommodating slip there, perhaps the along the fault found at the southern end of Lake Fagnano<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) which perhaps then connects with the HF. There the ranges of the Sierra de Alvear near the Turbio River (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) appear to be displaced sinistrally across this structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, thus this may help explain the potential slip discrepancy between the sites in Chile and Argentina. Ultimately, if there are other faults south of the HF or north of the DF that are accommodating modern deformation within the MFS, total Late-Quaternary geologic slip rates along this system could potentially be higher than 10.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.5&#x02009;mm/yr.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Field photos documenting tectonic geomorphology along faults within the MFS.

Nevertheless, any discrepancies between geodetic and geologic rates could be explained by choice of modeling parameters for the crust and/or the effects of the seismic cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Although event location information has significant uncertainties due to a sparse seismic network, recent historical events (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; two Mw 7.5+ events in 1949, Mw 7.0 in 1950, and Mw 7.2 in 1970) may have sufficient influence on the geodetic models to underestimate motions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Did the historic events occur along the same fault, that is only along the main MF? Importantly, paleoseismology work focused on dendrochronology from trees found along the MF east of Lake Fagnano<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, dated abrupt changes in tree rings (i.e. from concentric to asymmetric rings) in 1883&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5 and 1941&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10, which suggests two ruptures in close succession of this section of the fault. In New Zealand, along the plate boundary Alpine Fault, it was found using dendrochronology that trees within 15&#x02009;km of the main fault zone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> were damaged by the Mw ~ 8 earthquake in 1717<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Thus we can assume that the historic events in ~1879 and 1949, where shaking was experienced in Southern Patagonia, were due to ruptures along the MF. Young tectonic geomorphology along the MF (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) including sag ponds and shutter ridges could be targeted for better constraints on timing of pre-1949 and pre-1879 events to better characterise timing and recurrence of events. Or did events occur along both the MF and/or HF and DF during this same time period (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>)? Along the DF, there also damaged trees that appear to be growing diagonally, with a clear kink in the tree trunk where they then grow vertically, this is consistent with damage to the trunk of the trees during surface faulting (and tilting of the trunks away from vertical), and then the trees growing vertically post-event (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Although further work in the field should unravel these inferences regarding tree damage along the DF, based on similar observations of damaged trees located growing on and near scarps of the strike slip Alpine Fault in New Zealand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, it appears that trees along the DF (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) were tilted and damaged by a DF rupture and earthquake in the lifetime of this grove of Coihue trees (i.e. post 1680)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Despite these uncertainties, did more than one fault in the MFS rupture together like recent modern events demonstrate can occur (e.g. the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake in New Zealand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>)? Or do they operate independently? Although our new data provide important constraints on the rates, there are still a number of open ended key questions here specifically related to recurrence of events and timing most recent events on these faults. Because the faults in the MFS are fast slipping and a major source of crustal seismic hazard, these faults should be avoided to reduce fault rupture hazards (both onshore and in the Canals of southern Patagonia) in addition to being important sources of strong ground motions and coseismic hazards (e.g. landslides, liquefaction, rockfall). Since TdF is a hydrocarbon-producing region, understanding exactly where MFS active faults are located is also essential to reduce the potential for triggered seismicity due to contemporary fracking during oil and gas extraction. As much of the MFS is submarine either in the Atlantic Ocean or within the fiords of Chile, future marine geology investigations should address these unknowns.</p><p id="Par18">Since the MFS is fast slipping, and long-lived (since at least 6&#x02009;Ma and up to 20&#x02009;Ma), and apparently narrow, what does it tells us about strike slip plate boundaries? Modern active and steeply dipping strike slip faults of the MFS cut the contractional structures of the Magellan Fold and Thrust belt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However extensive regional glaciations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) combined with extensive vegetation (and much of the MFS being submarine) conceal faults here. Modeling suggests that deformation along MFS faults are focused around a narrow ~ 40 km-wide zone around the MF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Our mapping, fieldwork, and analysis suggest that at least three sub-parallel sinistral strike slip structures within the MFS, from north to south, the DF, MF, and HF, accommodate most of the ongoing active strike slip plate boundary deformation here in a very narrow zone that is &#x0003c;20&#x02009;km wide at the surface (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Based on observations from most onshore plate boundaries, generally deformation is partitioned along faults on both sides of the master faults (e.g. Alpine, San Andreas, and MF plate boundary faults), and thus slower slipping faults (although still active and accommodating plate boundary deformation) should be expected south of the HF and north of the DF and with less clear expression in the tectonic geomorphology due to slower rates. South of the HF, in the Beagle Channel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), there is proposed neotectonic activity of faults there based on relative altitude differences of marine terraces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, and presence of post Early Cretaceous strike slip faults that are identified in the field, however if these faults are indeed active requires future attention. Compared with the width of surface deformation along other onshore active continental strike-slip plate boundaries, for example the North American/Pacific Plate along the San Andreas Fault<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> (up to 200&#x02009;km) and the Marlborough Fault System in New Zealand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> (up to 150&#x02009;km), the MFS&#x02019;s 30-50&#x02009;km width in TdF is very narrow and localised from the Strait of Magellan to east (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This makes the MFS a candidate for an end member within plate tectonics, and perhaps one of the narrowest and most simplistic strike slip plate boundaries on Earth (Supplemental Material). The MFS well-developed geometry, simplicity (straight and localised) and remarkable length, could suggest a low ratio of small to large earthquakes due to smoothing along these faults and thus magnitude-frequency distributions derived from seismology may not reflect the actual seismic hazard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The limited period of instrumental recordings along the MFS, when compared with results from California<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, suggests that the MF may not be suitably described by the Gutenberg-Richter relationship<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> between major earthquakes; and that the MF does not have frequent moderate-sized earthquakes, but instead remains locked with major stress drops only occurring during large earthquakes and associated aftershocks.</p><p id="Par19">West of TdF near Cabo Froward (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Supplemental Material) faults within the MFS appears to spread out, and widen at the surface to &#x0003e;100&#x02009;km, and curve (i.e. change strike) towards the north forming a more diffusely distributed, and thus wider fault system than from TdF and east<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We speculate that this could due to the influence of the subduction zone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) where the MFS Plate Boundary is influenced by the complexities and heat flow found near the triple junction and/or perhaps related to effects of the Patagonian bend<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Another possibility is that there are extensive sub-vertical pre-MFS basement crustal faults with a similar array to that which we see today and which reactivated when the MFS system initated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. However, the most likely case is that the MFS system becomes more slip partitioned between the offshore subduction of the Antarctic Plate in the northwest (with more widely-spaced crustal faults) and the concentrated and narrow onshore strike slip faulting within in the MFS found in the area around TdF. We thus speculate that the MFS west of TdF is perhaps somewhat analogous to the Marlborough Fault System in New Zealand which becomes more slip-partitioned as the crustal plate boundary encounters the Hikurangi subduction zone, versus being more narrow and localised along the Alpine Fault<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.

As slip-rates can change over long-time scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, future fieldwork and geochronology will better constrain timing of MFS initiation and thus better constrain the long-term slip rate, neotectonic behaviour including seismic hazard, and Late-Cenozoic regional tectonics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par20">To better understand long-term Late-Cenozoic geological separations along the MFS we reviewed the literature and previous geological mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.

Mapping of faults along the MFS was undertaken in Google Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> and a 12.5&#x02009;m/pix resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the region derived from ALOSPALSAR Global Radar Imagery data (Acquisition date: 2010-12-30, 2011-01-11)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> to identify potential fault traces and displaced Quaternary features. Remote mapping was then field validated. Additionally, air-photos were collected in the field with a DJI Phantom 4 drone at sites identified during desktop mapping (Supplemental Material). In Chile we screened from the Beavouir Range to the northern edge of Lake Fagnano to best identify MFS fault traces (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These aerial photographs were modelled using Agisoft Standard Photoscan Pro 1.3.2 (2018)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> in order to develop Structure from Motion (SfM) site models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> including 3D DEMs (which include vegetation and thus could be referred to as Digital Surface Models (DSM)), and full colour orthophotos (&#x0003c;1&#x02009;m/pixel; see Supplemental Material). We note this process was iterative, because drone flights allowed for identification of additional field sites. These data were imported into ArcMap ArcMap 10.3 software for spatial analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. During fieldwork, characterisation of deposits and tectonic geomorphology were also documented.</p><p id="Par21">Using the SfM models, faults within the MFS were located as an idealized planar traces, and displaced geomorphic markers were observed along those traces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.

These offset clusters are interpreted as the cumulative slip associated with fault ruptures that occurred post-ice retreat since the fault scarps are formed in Late-Quaternary glacial deposits. These markers were inspected in detail (both in the field in the models) to avoid landforms that possibly were modified by other reasons, for example, channel deflection or meanders, or due to anthropogenic reasons (i.e. fences, tree felling for timber or firewood).
