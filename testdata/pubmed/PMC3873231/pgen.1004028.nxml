Recent reports describing localization of NuRD provide new insights that question previous models on NuRD action, but are not in complete agreement. Here, we provide location analysis of endogenous MBD3, a component of NuRD complex, in two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) using two independent genomic techniques: DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) and ChIP-seq. We observed concordance of the resulting genomic localization, suggesting that these studies are converging on a robust map for NuRD in the cancer cell genome. MBD3 preferentially associated with CpG rich promoters marked by H3K4me3 and showed cell-type specific localization across gene bodies, peaking around the transcription start site. A subset of sites bound by MBD3 was enriched in H3K27ac and was in physical proximity to promoters in three-dimensional space, suggesting function as enhancers. MBD3 enrichment was also noted at promoters modified by H3K27me3. Functional analysis of chromatin indicated that MBD3 regulates nucleosome occupancy near promoters and in gene bodies. These data suggest that MBD3, and by extension the NuRD complex, may have multiple roles in fine tuning expression for both active and silent genes, representing an important step in defining regulatory mechanisms by which NuRD complex controls chromatin structure and modification status.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Chromatin structure is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms; its dysregulation is associated with developmental abnormalities and disease. The Mi-2/nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex is proposed to regulate chromatin structure by changing the location and/or the chemical properties of the fundamental building block of chromatin, the nucleosome. NuRD has been shown by genetics to be important for normal development, yet the detailed mechanism of how NuRD regulates chromatin structure is still unclear. Here, we study the localization and function of MBD3, a component of NuRD, in two human breast cancer cell lines using two independent genomic technologies. Our data demonstrate that existing models, which associate NuRD with transcriptional repression, are not completely correct. Rather, MBD3 showed cell-type specific localization at active genes. Moreover, we found a previously unidentified localization of MBD3 across gene bodies and identified a regulatory role for MBD3 in nucleosome organization. Our data provide a reliable starting point from which to address mechanisms by which NuRD controls chromatin structure and nuclear biology.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIH (Project number ZO1ES101965 to PAW) and by a grant from NIH (CA134304 to HS).

Although this model provided a useful experimental framework, like all models, it has been challenged by subsequent data. In particular, the depiction of NuRD's principal function as a regulator of a silent chromatin state has been questioned by genetic and molecular studies from Georgopoulos and colleagues <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and Hendrich and colleagues <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, which provide compelling evidence that NuRD can have both positive and negative impacts on gene expression.</p><p>zNuRD complex contains six core subunits which are invariably encoded by 2 or more gene paralogs, prompting the hypothesis that combinatorial assembly of subunits may contribute to functional specificity <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Bowen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The smallest complex subunit can be either MBD2 or MBD3 <xref rid="pgen.1004028-LeGuezennec1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, members of the family of proteins that possess the methyl CpG binding domain (MBD) fold. While MBD2 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> methyl CpG binding protein, mammalian MBD3 has lost the ability to selectively interact with methylated DNA <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Hendrich1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Recently, however, it has been suggested that MBD3 specifically binds another modified form of DNA, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), leading to NuRD recruitment at 5-hmC marked loci in embryonic stem cells <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Yildirim1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Other investigators find that NuRD complexes are involved in different aspects of the transcription cycle, coupling its action to enhancers <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Whyte1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> or to recruitment of polycomb complexes <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Reynolds2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Currently, the field lacks consensus on the localization of MBD3 (and by extension NuRD complex) in the genome as well as its roles in modulating chromatin biology to facilitate gene regulation <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel sequencing, ChIP-seq, represents &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; methodology to identify sites of enrichment of a particular protein (or modified protein) across the genome. High quality ChIP-seq data are dependent on a number of technical factors, including antibody quality, fixation conditions (where ChIP is performed from fixed chromatin), chromatin shearing or cleavage with nuclease, and stringency of wash conditions for immune complexes. Progress over the last decade has established the principle that conditions that produce high quality ChIP data for one protein may not necessarily be effective for others. Performing ChIP on chromatin regulators, including NuRD complex, is particularly challenging <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Ram1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Given the technical issues, the lack of concordance of recent NuRD ChIP-seq studies may not be surprising. It does, however, highlight a need for independent studies to provide additional data for comparison.</p><p>Here we have analyzed human MBD3 localization across the genome using two complementary genomic approaches. We first used DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID), a methodology independent of antibodies, chromatin shearing and other technically challenging features of ChIP. We also performed ChIP-seq studies of endogenous human MBD3 following optimization of antibody, cross-linking and chromatin shearing. The results of these two techniques were in excellent agreement, suggesting they may not be unduly influenced by technical issues. The resulting, composite location analysis revealed unexpected association of MBD3 with the active fraction of the genome. MBD3 localized preferentially to active promoters characterized by histone marks associated with open chromatin and with genomic regions bearing the properties of enhancers, supporting the emerging evidence that models depicting NuRD's principal functions as a component of repressive chromatin require re-evaluation. In addition, MBD3 coated gene bodies of actively transcribed genes, extending to the transcript end site. Conversely, we also observed association of MBD3 with promoters of genes marked by repressive histone marks, albeit not with the frequency of active promoters, highlighting the likelihood that NuRD action is not unidirectional and is context dependent. Finally, the largest category of loci bound by MBD3 has no obvious association with known chromatin features, underscoring the relative dearth of knowledge on NuRD localization and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MBD3 localization by DamID</title><p>We initiated location analysis of MBD3 in human cells using the DamID technique <xref rid="pgen.1004028-vanSteensel1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

We displayed the results in a heatmap with genes ordered based on MBD3 density; scores for H3K4me3 and for gene expression were displayed in the same order. We observed a striking association of MBD3 DamID score with H3K4me3 density by ChIP-seq and with gene expression &#x02013; regardless of cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004028-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Most MBD3 bound genes were highly expressed and carried high levels of H3K4me3 in both MCF-7 and MDA-231 cells, suggesting MBD3 preferentially associates with open chromatin regions at actively transcribed genes.</p><p>To describe the binding pattern of MBD3-Dam with promoters, we constructed a composite analysis across all promoters (&#x02212;3 to +3 kb relative to TSS). MBD3 was prominently enriched in two distinct peaks, each about 1.5 kb from TSS, with a prominent dip at TSS in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004028-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). To ascertain whether this enrichment pattern was associated with promoter type, we subdivided our MBD3 data into three promoter classes <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Weber1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Regardless of cell line, we observed that MBD3 preferentially associates with CpG rich promoters with little obvious accumulation evident at CpG poor promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004028-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To develop an understanding of the association of MBD3 with genic regions not represented on the promoter arrays, we performed MBD3 DamID using a tiling array covering human chromosomes 6, 7, and 8. We constructed a gene model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), observing a gradient of MBD3 density from a peak around TSS that gradually declines across the gene body. A second peak of MBD3 accumulation was noted roughly concurrent with the transcript end site (TES) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004028-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>The association of MBD3 with overlapping, but distinct, genes in MCF-7 and MDA-231 cells suggested that the MBD3-NuRD complex may play a role in cell-type specific patterns of transcription. To address this issue, we performed Functional Analysis using Broad Institute's Molecular Signature Data Base (MSigDB v 3.0). We specifically asked whether the MBD3-NuRD target genes (as defined for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004028-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) were enriched for gene expression patterns diagnostic of the luminal and basal transcriptional programs in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004028-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004028.s007">Table S1</xref>). Functional analysis demonstrated significant enrichment of luminal discriminatory genes, but not basal discriminatory genes, in the MCF-7 (luminal) specific MBD3-bound gene set. MDA-231 (basal) specific MBD3-NuRD putative targets displayed the opposite pattern. These data suggest that MBD3, and by extension the MBD3-NuRD complex, may have a biological role in breast cancer subtype specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>High-resolution mapping of MBD3 by ChIP-seq</title><p>The DamID technique, while extremely useful, has relatively low resolution, relies on the presence of the GATC motif, and our experiments provided data only on the regions tiled in the microarray platform chosen. Therefore, we opted to pursue MBD3 ChIP-seq to obtain a higher resolution map for MBD3 that included genic and intergenic regions not represented on the arrays. We first optimized conditions for ChIP of endogenous MBD3, finding that fixation conditions are critical to the success of robust MBD3 ChIP. We applied a two-step crosslinking method, similar to our previous conditions <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Fujita1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Fujita2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, crosslinking with disuccinimidyl glutarate followed by formaldehyde (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p><p>Using these optimized conditions, we prepared two biological replicates of MBD3 ChIP in MCF-7 and in MDA-231 cells. Precipitated DNA was analyzed by massively parallel sequencing. After initial filtering and mapping of the sequence data, we merged the biological replicates for each cell line prior to further analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Visual assessment in genome browser format indicated multiple regions where enrichment appeared similar in both cell lines as well as many regions where enrichment was cell-type specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004028-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

Overall, we noted at least five different patterns of histone modification characteristic of MBD3 bound genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1004028-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Regions encompassing the transcription start and containing histones modified by H3K4me3 (pattern 1; active promoters) were very abundant in this dataset, accounting for 18.4% of MBD3 enriched regions. Colocalization with H3K27me3 and TSS (pattern 2; inactive promoters) was present with some frequency (2.3% of all MBD3 enriched regions), while colocalization with H3K9me3 (pattern 3; inactive promoters) was rare (about 1.4%) in these data. Regions enriched in both MBD3 and H3K27ac, but not overlapping TSS (pattern 4; active enhancers), were the most frequent pattern observed in our dataset (38.6%). Surprisingly, approximately one quarter (22.5%) of MBD3 enriched genomic regions (pattern 5) were found in chromatin lacking any of these patterns of histone marks, suggesting that much remains to be learned regarding NuRD complex enrichment relative to local chromatin features.</p><p>To clarify whether MBD3 localization has any correlation with DNA modification in this system, we queried DNA methylation status within MBD3 bound regions.

We verified that MBD3 was efficiently depleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004028.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Native chromatin from control and MBD3 depleted cells were digested with micrococcal nuclease and the resulting mononucleosome-sized DNA fragments were collected and subjected to massively parallel sequencing.

Control cells showed a regular nucleosome organization consistent with previous publications; a nucleosome depleted region (NDR) is observed around the TSS and well-positioned nucleosomes flank this NDR. In MBD3 depleted cells, nucleosome phasing was similar to that in control cells but nucleosome occupancy was decreased - particularly at the NDR, and the &#x02212;1, +1, +2, +3, and +4 nucleosomes.

These data associate MBD3 with previously undescribed genomic features, including extensive colocalization with the bodies of active genes. Further, an abundant category of MBD3 localization observed was not associated with any particular genomic feature, histone or DNA mark we analyzed, suggesting that the catalog of functions for NuRD is not yet exhaustive. Finally, we assessed the contribution of MBD3 to chromatin organization, finding that MBD3 regulates nucleosome organization near promoters and within gene bodies - consistent with its localization.</p><p>The use of multiple techniques for location analysis of chromatin associated factors provides an opportunity to control for common technical problems inherent to a single protocol. DamID involves expression of a fusion protein that modifies DNA in its genomic vicinity with detection relying on creation of novel restriction sites. It suffers from poor spatial resolution relative to ChIP and the necessity of exogenous expression of a fusion protein that must faithfully recapitulate the biological properties of the unmodified factor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation relies on biochemical fractionation of chromatin, in many cases following fixation. High quality ChIP results are reliant on antibody affinity and specificity as well as on crosslinking conditions and biochemical fractionation methods. Our results using these two techniques are in excellent agreement, suggesting they are converging on a robust genomic location map for MBD3 in the system chosen.

Presumably, the dynamic equilibrium between the acetylated and deacetylated state for histones, or other chromatin associated factors, is an important determinant of promoter/enhancer function and its regulation.</p><p>While association of MBD3 with active promoters was abundant in our data, we also observed accumulation in regions with local chromatin marks diagnostic of transcriptional repression.

Somewhat surprisingly, we did not observe substantial colocalization of MBD3 with H3K9me3 (although we did observe that a substantial proportion of promoters bound by H3K9me3 are also bound by MBD3), despite extensive biochemical data documenting specific interaction of the PHD finger domains of CHD4 with this mark <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Musselman1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. While we do not completely understand the nature of this discrepancy, it may reflect the propensity of this histone mark to be localized in the repetitive fraction of the genome. The biochemical data also indicate high affinity interaction of CHD4's PHD fingers with H3K9 acetylation <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Musselman2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, which agrees very nicely with our ChIP-seq data. It is interesting to speculate that association of the PHD1/2 domain of CHD4 with different modifications, both of which change the physical properties of a single lysine residue on histone H3, may be instrumental in directing NuRD to regions of the genome with completely opposing functional states.</p><p>The methyl CpG binding domain family is intimately tied to cytosine modification <xref rid="pgen.1004028-Hendrich2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

Further, they predict novel functions that remain to be described. These predictions clearly indicate that models describing NuRD as a static corepressor are inadequate in the face of emerging genomic data.
