Furthermore, many patients who undergo resection of oral cancer require post-operative intensive treatment unit (ITU) beds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23871">2</xref></sup> With approximately 8,000 more hospital deaths to date in 2020 than is routine, elective surgery poses stress on a healthcare system already experiencing unprecedented pressures in ITU, and perhaps, a redeployed staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23879">3</xref></sup> Dilemmas arise in terms of delaying or proceeding with surgery. Further useful information can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://globalsurg.org">https://globalsurg.org</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/coronavirus/rcs-covid-research-group/">https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/coronavirus/rcs-covid-research-group/</ext-link>.</p><p>We admire the epic efforts of our surgical and maxillofacial colleagues in juggling these competing demands in the best interests of the population.</p><p>What can <italic>BDJ</italic> readers do to help? We can make at-risk patients we triage, and patients who access our practice websites, aware of the Mouth Cancer Foundation symptom checker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mouthcancerfoundation.org">www.mouthcancerfoundation.org</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23885">4</xref></sup> Video consultation also offers a solution and practice websites and social media threads can include oral health advice. National Smile Month started on 18 May offering digital engagement (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nationalsmilemonth.org/">www.nationalsmilemonth.org/</ext-link>). Mouth Cancer Action Month is in November; the infamous #BlueLipSelfie might help raise awareness (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bluelipselfie.co.uk/">www.bluelipselfie.co.uk/</ext-link>). We can continue to signpost smoking cessation advice online too - perhaps this new remote practice offers an opportunity to support patients who are interested in quitting smoking and the Smokefree service allows patient to access advice and support from experts: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://quitnow.smokefree.nhs.uk/">quitnow.smokefree.nhs.uk/</ext-link>. We need to remember those patients who have previously received a cancer diagnosis who would usually be accessing our care to receive support and preventive dental care. Many charities such as The Throat Cancer Foundation and The Mouth Cancer Foundation are continuing to provide support to affected patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.throatcancerfoundation.org">www.throatcancerfoundation.org</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mouthcancerfoundation.org/">mouthcancerfoundation.org/</ext-link>). </p><p>The primary care dental team has an important role in raising awareness and trying to mitigate where possible a post-pandemic spike in oral cancers with poor prognoses. </p></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References </title><ref id="CR23863"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">NHS.
