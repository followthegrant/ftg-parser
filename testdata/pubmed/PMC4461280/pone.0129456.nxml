Two markers of coagulation activation (prothrombin fragment F1+2 and fibrin fragment D-dimer) were measured by immunoenzymatic methods in plasma samples from 30 patients with active chronic autoimmune urticaria, positive for autologous serum skin test, 30 patients with active bullous pemphigoid and 30 healthy subjects. In skin biopsies, tissue factor expression was evaluated by both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. F1+2 and D-dimer levels were higher in active chronic autoimmune urticaria (276.5&#x000b1;89.8 pmol/L and 5.56&#x000b1;4.40 nmol/L, respectively) than in controls (145.2&#x000b1;38.0 pmol/L and 1.06&#x000b1;0.25 nmol/L; P=0.029 and P=0.011) and were much higher in active bullous pemphigoid (691.7&#x000b1;318.7 pmol/L and 15.24&#x000b1;9.09 nmol/L, respectively) (P&#x0003c;0.0001). Tissue factor positivity was evident in skin biopsies of both disorders with higher intensity in bullous pemphigoid. F1+2 and D-dimer, during remission, were markedly reduced in both disorders. These findings support the involvement of coagulation activation in the pathophysiology of both diseases. The strong systemic activation of coagulation in bullous pemphigoid may contribute to increase the thrombotic risk and provides the rationale for clinical trials on anticoagulant treatments in this disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by &#x0201c;Ricerca corrente&#x0201d;, Fondazione IRCCS Ca&#x02019; Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italy.

Proinflammatory mediators induce the expression of tissue factor (TF), the main initiator of blood coagulation, while activated proteases of coagulation trigger inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Such a cross-talk amplifies and maintains the activation of both systems, and is potentially involved in the pathophysiology of autoimmune skin diseases, such as chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU) and bullous pemphigoid (BP).</p><p>Chronic urticaria (CU) is a skin disorder characterized by the recurrent eruption of short-lived wheals accompanied by redness and itching for at least 6 weeks (<xref rid="pone.0129456.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The disease can be classified as spontaneous and inducible CU [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Considering spontaneous CU, experimental and clinical findings have supported an autoimmune origin in about 40% of cases [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In these chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU) patients, circulating histamine-releasing autoantibodies directed against IgE (anti-IgE) or against the &#x003b1; subunit of the high&#x02014;affinity IgE receptor (anti-Fc&#x003b5;RI) have been demonstrated <italic>in-vitro</italic> by immunoblotting, enzyme immunoassay and basophil histamine-release assay [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and are associated with positivity of autologous serum skin test (ASST) <italic>in-vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Mast cells activated primarily by histamine-releasing autoantibodies secrete proinflammatory mediators, including histamine, tryptase, leukotriene C4, interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Along with autoimmune mechanisms mediated by autoantibodies, inflammation is also involved as supported by increased levels of C reactive protein and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recently, evidence of the possible involvement of the coagulation cascade in the pathogenesis of CU has emerged [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. CU patients show elevated plasma levels of prothrombin fragment F1+2, suggesting thrombin generation [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In subsequent studies we found that CU patients show an activation of the TF pathway of coagulation cascade [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and that in patients with severe disease such activation can be so pronounced as to produce an elevation of plasma levels of D-dimer, the last being regarded as a sign of fibrinolysis [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The activation of the TF pathway of coagulation results in turn in the generation of thrombin which, in experimental models, has been shown to induce edema [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and release of inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0129456.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0129456.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Clinical pictures of chronic urticaria and bullous pemphigoid.</title><p>Wheals accompanied by redness on the back in a chronic urticaria patient (panel A).

The pathophysiology of BP is linked to production of autoantibodies directed against two hemidesmosomal antigens, BP180 and BP230, with complement activation and leucocyte skin infiltration playing an important role [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Both T cells and B cells with autoreactivity towards BP180/BP230 are necessary for its pathogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. During acute phase of BP, autoreactive T helper (Th) 1 and Th 2 lymphocytes cooperatively play a role in the development of the disease process [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recently, a focus has been placed on the possible contribution of the newly discovered Th 17 subset to the pathophysiology of BP [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, a reduction of T regulatory cells, whose immunosurveillance action is critical in preventing autoimmunity, has been observed in lesional skin of BP patients [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Finally, also the activation of the coagulation cascade at skin level seems to be involved in the disease pathophysiology. In fact, an increase in the prothrombotic markers F1 + 2 and D-dimer concentrations has been found in blister fluid samples [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The expression of TF in BP skin specimens suggests its role in initiating blood coagulation also in this disease. Coagulation activation may contribute to tissue damage and blister formation by the generation of thrombin. In plasma samples from BP patients, F1 + 2 and D-dimer levels were also increased, although to a lesser extent than in blister fluids [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Based on these findings, coagulation activation in BP patients could contribute to inflammation, tissue damage, blister formation and potentially to thrombosis.</p><p>The main aim of this study was to assess and compare the plasma markers of coagulation activation by means of immunoenzymatic methods, and lesional TF expression by means of immunohistochemistry and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, between CAU and BP, two immune-mediated diseases that share the involvement of coagulation in their pathophysiology but differ in clinical and prognostic features.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Patients</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Chronic autoimmune urticaria (CAU)</title><p>Thirty patients with CAU (13 men and 17 women, median age 43 years, range 23&#x02013;63), admitted to the Dermatology Department from January 2012 to December 2014, were selected for the study.

A stronger systemic activation was found in BP than in CAU, while at tissue level, a marked expression of TF, the main initiator of blood coagulation, was found in both diseases. The activation of coagulation was shown to parallel the disease activity in both CAU and BP; in fact, during remission, we observed its normalization in both CAU and BP. These findings support the role of coagulation activation in the pathophysiology of CAU and BP in agreement with previous observations [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The stronger activation found in patients with BP may contribute to increase their thrombotic risk.</p><p>Recently, using co-localization experiments, TF has been found to be expressed by eosinophils present in the inflammatory infiltrate of CAU and BP skin lesions [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This indicates that eosinophils play a role as a source of TF, in line with studies showing that eosinophils store TF and rapidly transfer it to the cell membrane during activation [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The strong expression of TF in CAU lesional skin may be due to eosinophil activation, even if patients with CAU virtually never show peripheral eosinophilia, probably because TF specifically facilitates the early transendothelial migration of the eosinophils [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Eosinophils are also important components of the BP inflammatory infiltrate, which also consists of numerous T lymphocytes and few other inflammatory cells [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Notably, the T lymphocytes infiltrating lesional skin of BP exhibit mainly a T helper type 2 (Th2) phenotype and produce cytokines and chemokines inducing recruitment and activation of eosinophils, in particular interleukin-5 and eotaxin [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Consistent with this, TF-mediated coagulation pathway may be considered as a common pathogenetic event in both CAU and BP disease. The activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway generates thrombin that may play a role in the pathogenesis of both diseases by increasing vascular permeability [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and favouring the transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells and their accumulation in the skin [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In particular, in CAU, the generation of thrombin induces edema by a direct effect on endothelial cells and indirectly by a thrombin-related release of inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Most effects of thrombin are probably mediated by histamine (and hence mast cell mediated), as they have been reported to be reduced by anti-histamines and mast cell granule depletion in animal models [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the other hand, in BP hypercoagulability may contribute to inflammation, tissue damage and blister formation, although other pathomechanisms have been suggested to link eosinophils and hypercoagulability, involving endothelium, platelets and coagulation itself [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>It is noteworthy that in plasma samples from CAU and BP patients included in the present study, F1+2 and D-dimer levels were significantly increased compared with normal controls, indicating that the coagulation cascade is activated also at a systemic level, as previously found [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], although methods with different sensitivity and specificity were used. Plasma levels of these prothrombotic markers were strikingly increased especially in BP patients. The finding that the increase in plasma markers of thrombin generation and fibrinolysis parallels plasma CRP levels strongly supports the close link between coagulation activation and inflammation in CAU and BP pathogenesis. This may have clinical implications both at skin level (wheals and blisters) and systemic level (thrombotic risk) [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, it is well known that the inflammatory response inhibits fibrinolysis, which contributes to the prothrombotic state seen in conditions such as sepsis [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], inflammatory bowel diseases [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The results of a previous study on a group of patients with active BP showed that fibrinolysis is inhibited, due mainly to an increase in the plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) activity and antigen [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The most important clinical consequence of the hypercoagulable state related to coagulation activation in CAU and, to a higher extent, in BP patients is an increased thrombotic risk. Indeed, it has been reported that the risk of thrombosis is increased in patients with BP [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and we have found an annual incidence of venous thrombosis of 8% [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], clearly higher than that observed in the general elderly population (0&#x000b7;28&#x02013;0&#x000b7;41% per year) [<xref rid="pone.0129456.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Interestingly, in the CAU patients evaluated during activity and remission, both F1 + 2 and D-dimer plasma levels significantly decreased during remission. Similarly, prothrombotic marker plasma levels markedly decrease during disease remission obtained with immunosuppressive treatment in BP patients. Based on these findings, it may be hypothesized that the reduction in coagulation activation observed after treatment may not only contribute to the healing of the cutaneous manifestations, but also to the reduction of thrombotic risk.</p><p>The limitation of the present study is the relatively small number of patients included, but this is counterbalanced by the high mean difference in F1+2 and D-dimer plasma levels between CAU and BP patients, which can be demonstrated with enough power with this sample size.</p><p>In conclusion, in the present study the measurement of biomarkers of coagulation activation confirmed that the coagulation cascade is systemically activated in the acute phase of such inflammatory cutaneous disorders as CAU and BP. These diseases differ in the strength of coagulation activation at a systemic level, being significantly increased in BP which is burdened with a high thrombotic risk.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by &#x0201c;Ricerca corrente&#x0201d;, Fondazione IRCCS Ca&#x02019; Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italy.</p><p>The authors thank Dr. Luigi Ghilardini for the valuable assistance in the preparation of the figures.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0129456.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
