However, the mechanism underlying the control of PI3K-III activity remains elusive. Here we report the identification of NRBF2 as a component in the specific PI3K-III complex and a modulator of PI3K-III activity. Through its MIT domain, NRBF2 binds Atg14L directly and enhances Atg14L-linked Vps34 kinase activity and autophagy induction. NRBF2 deficient cells exhibit enhanced vulnerability to ER stress that is reversed by re-introducing exogenous NRBF2. NRBF2 deficient mice develop focal liver necrosis and ductular reaction, accompanied by impaired Atg14L-linked Vps34 activity and autophagy, though the mice show no increased mortality. Our data reveals a key role for NRBF2 in the assembly of the specific Atg14L-Beclin 1-Vps34-Vps15 complex for autophagy induction. Thus, NRBF2 modulates autophagy via regulation of PI3K-III and prevents ER stress-mediated cytotoxicity and liver injury.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Autophagy is a conserved cellular pathway that degrades long-lived proteins and other cytoplasmic contents through lysosomes. Vps34 is the only Class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K-III) in mammals; it phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Beclin 1 is one of the earliest autophagy proteins identified in mammals<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The Beclin 1-Vps34 complex plays an essential role in the autophagy nucleation and maturation process, by forming multiple complexes with different binding partners. Previously, our group and others identified multiple Beclin 1-Vps34 binding partners including Atg14L/Barkor<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, UVRAG<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, Rubicon<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, Bif1<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, AMBRA1<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, Bcl2<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Despite the identification of an increasing number of Beclin 1-Vps34 interacting proteins, the molecular mechanism for their integral functions in regulating PI3K-III activity and autophagy remains poorly understood. UVRAG and Atg14L are known to directly bind Beclin 1 via their strong coiled-coil domain interactions, forming stable Beclin 1-UVRAG and Beclin 1-Atg14L complexes, which are highly conserved and contribute to two distinct physiological functions of PI3K-III<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The Atg14L complex controls initiation of autophagy<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, while the UVRAG complex is involved predominantly in autophagosome maturation and endocytosis<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The Beclin 1-Vps34 complex is essential for mouse development and viability. The Beclin 1 or Vps34 knockout mice are early embryonic lethal<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>; and liver-specific deletion of Vps34 leads to severe liver damage associated with hepatomegaly, hepatic steatosis and impaired protein degradation<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">To elucidate the mechanism of PI3K-III-mediated autophagy regulation, we expanded our search for Beclin 1-Vps34 activity regulators and characterized their functions <italic>in vivo</italic>.

NRBF2 modulates autophagy via regulating Atg14L-linked Vps34 activity. Our study also reveals a critical function of NRBF2 in promoting the assembly of a specific Atg14L-Beclin 1-Vps34-Vps15 complex as a highly active PI3K-III kinase complex. Our data demonstrates NRBF2 as a PI3K-III modulator that plays a role in cell protection from ER stress-induced apoptosis and in tissue homeostasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>NRBF2 is a component of the Beclin 1-Vps34 complex</title><p id="P4">Using green fluorescent protein tagged Beclin 1 (Beclin 1-GFP) to replace the endogenous Beclin 1 in mice, we previously reported the identification of Atg14L, UVRAG, Rubicon, and Vps15 proteins as Beclin 1 binding proteins (Bands 1&#x02013;6) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In the same experiment, we found a new Beclin 1-binding protein at 40 kDa. (No. 7) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), which was named NRBF2 in a previous publication and has little known function<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The interaction between endogenous Beclin 1 and NRBF2 was confirmed in mouse brain lysates through co-immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis with either anti-Beclin 1 or anti-NRBF2 antibody (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Using anti-NRBF2 antibody IP, we found that NRBF2 is associated with Vps34, Vps15, Atg14L, and UVRAG proteins in brain lysates, noting that all proteins, except UVRAG, are enriched after IP (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In addition, gel filtration separating native protein complexes from mouse brain tissues according to protein size shows overlap of NRBF2, Atg14L and Beclin 1 proteins in multiple fractions. The &#x0201c;peak&#x0201d; NRBF2 fractions correspond to a molecular weight of approximately 700 kD (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), suggesting that the primary species of NRBF2 exist in large protein complexes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Atg14L binds NRBF2 directly and links NRBF2 to Beclin 1</title><p id="P5">We next examined the role of Atg14L in the NRBF2-Beclin 1 interaction. When Atg14L expression was knocked down with small interfering RNA (siRNA), anti-Beclin 1 antibody pulled down Beclin 1 but not NRBF2. The control scrambled siRNA treatment had no effect on the Beclin 1 and NRBF2 interaction (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). In contrast, NRBF2-specific siRNA treatment significantly reduced NRBF2 expression without altering the binding between Beclin 1 and Atg14L in the co-IP experiment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Thus, the Beclin 1-NRBF2 interaction critically depends on Atg14L.</p><p id="P6">To characterize the Atg14L-NRBF2 interaction, we incubated purified FLAG-Atg14L protein with GST-NRBF2 or control GST protein and performed a GST pull-down assay. GST-NRBF2, but not GST alone, pulled down FLAG-Atg14L, indicating a direct interaction between Atg14L and NRBF2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). We sought to identify sequence requirement(s) in Atg14L for the NRBF2-Atg14L binding. The results indicate that the N-terminal sequence of Atg14L that contains coiled coil domain 1 (CCD1, 1&#x02013;95 amino acid)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> is indispensable for the interaction between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Overexpressed NRBF2-CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) fusion protein was mostly diffuse in the cytoplasm and nucleus in transfected HEK293 cells. When transfected alone, Beclin 1-GFP or Atg14L-AsRed also appeared diffuse in the cytoplasm as previously shown<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. But co-expression of NRBF2-GFP, Atg14L-AsRed and Beclin 1-Myc led to a redistribution of NRBF2-GFP into puncta also containing Atg14L-AsRed and Beclin 1-Myc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a, b</xref>), suggesting an functional link between Atg14L, Beclin 1 and NRBF2 proteins.</p><p id="P8">In a parallel experiment, we established a stable cell line expressing inducible HA-tagged NRBF2 to identify NRBF2 binding proteins via HA affinity purification. The mass-spectrometry analysis revealed Atg14L, Vps34, Vps15 and Beclin 1 proteins as the significant NRBF2 binding partners. Note that UVRAG was also found as an interactor of NRBF2, though with less confidence compared to the others (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1g</xref>), consistent with our findings from endogenous IP result (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The above results identify NRBF2 as a new component in Beclin 1-Vps34 complexes associated primarily with Atg14L.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>NRBF2 MIT domain binds Atg14L to regulate Vps34 activity</title><p id="P9">We then asked whether NRBF2 modulates PI3K-III activity. Because NRBF2 directly binds Atg14L (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we specifically examined how loss of NRBF2 affects Atg14L-linked Vps34 activity. We first established mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) devoid of NRBF2 expression (knock-out, KO) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Using an anti-Atg14L antibody<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, we performed IP to detect Atg14L binding proteins in NRBF2 WT and KO MEFs. We found that levels of precipitated Vps34 and Vps15 are significantly reduced or diminished in NRBF2 KO cells when normalized against IPed Atg14L, while the total levels of these proteins are unchanged (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We also analyzed the precipitated Vps34 lipid kinase activity by measuring <sup>32</sup>P-labled phosphatidylinositol (PI(3)P). The result showed that the Atg14L-linked Vps34 activity is markedly lower in NRBF2 KO MEFs than WT MEFs. Moreover, we re-introduced NRBF2 by transfecting NRBF2 KO MEFs with NRBF2-CFP and performed the same assays. We found that transfection of NRBF2-CFP, but not CFP, induces a recovery of Vps34 and Vps15 protein levels as well as Vps34 lipid kinase activity in IP product of NRBF2 KO MEFs to near WT levels (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).</p><p id="P10">There are two discrete motifs in NRBF2: an N-terminal microtubule interaction and trafficking (MIT) domain and a C-terminal coiled coil domain (CCD) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We transfected NRBF2 KO MEFs with NRBF2 mutants missing either the MIT domain (dMIT-CFP) or the CCD (dCCD-CFP), and performed IP and lipid kinase assays as described above. The result shows that both full-length NRBF2-CFP and dCCD-CFP mutant were pulled down together with endogenous Atg14L by anti-Atg14L antibody, which is associated with the enhanced Vps34 and Vps15 protein levels and lipid kinase activity. In contrast, the dMIT-CFP mutant fails to interact with Atg14L or rescue Vps34/Vps15 levels in NRBF2 KO MEFs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The data demonstrates that Atg14L interacts with NRBF2 through its MIT domain and promotes Vps34-Beclin 1-Vps15-Atg14L complex formation required for modulating Atg14L-linked Vps34 activity.</p><p id="P11">To further assess NRBF2&#x02019;s role in modulating Atg14L-Vps34 activity, we overexpressed NRBF2-CFP together with Myc-Vps34, Vps15-V5-His and FLAG-Atg14L in HEK293T cells and measured FLAG-Atg14L linked Vps34 kinase activity. The result shows that NRBF2-CFP expression increases the <sup>32</sup>P-PI(3)P levels above the control CFP transfection (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). The data strongly supports the role of NRBF2 in promoting Atg14L-linked Vps34 activity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>NRBF2 regulates autophagy induction</title><p id="P12">We observed NRBF2-GFP co-localization with Atg14L-AsRed and Beclin1-Myc in puncta to which autophagosome protein LC3 appears to be recruited in both normal and nutrient starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). To determine the role of NRBF2 in autophagy, we first examined the impact of NRBF2 knockdown on long-lived protein degradation. When grown in complete medium, NIH3T3 cells treated with NRBF2 siRNA displayed a trend of reduction in the <sup>3</sup>H Leucine release compared to the cells treated with control siRNA. Upon nutrient starvation, NRBF2 siRNA caused a significant decrease in <sup>3</sup>H Leucine release, while this effect was abolished in the presence of wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K-III and autophagy (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Atg14L knockdown with siRNA showed a similar effect to NRBF2 siRNA in impairing autophagic activity as expected (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Under both normal (full medium) conditions and rapamycin treatment (a stimulator of autophagy), NRBF2 KO MEFs have higher levels of autophagy substrate p62/SQSTM1 than wild type (WT) MEFs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). While the levels of the lipidated form of LC3 (LC3-II) are similar between NRBF2 KO and WT MEFs under normal conditions, rapamycin treatment results in a significant increase in LC3-II levels in WT MEFs but not in NRBF2 KO MEFs. Furthermore, induced expression of AcGFP-NRBF2 in a stably transfected cell line leads to an increase in both LC3I and LC3II levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We next examined phagophores (autophagosome precursors) and autophagosome numbers in NRBF2 KO MEFs. The number of autophagosomes labeled by anti-LC3 antibody was decreased in NRBF2 KO MEFs compared to WT MEFs under normal conditions and rapamycin treatment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d, f</xref>). Staining phagophores with anti-WIPI2 antibody shows remarkable reduction of fluorescent puncta under normal condition, rapamycin treatment and nutrient withdrawal (HBSS buffer) in NRBF2 KO MEFs compared to WT MEFs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e, f</xref>). Induction of autophagy with rapamycin or HBSS buffer increased LC3 and WIPI2 puncta in NRBF2 KO MEFs but to a much lesser extent than WT MEFs. In addition, the difference in WIPI2 puncta number between KO and WT MEF is much more robust with rapamycin treatment or HBSS than under control or non-stressful condition (one-way ANOVA, p=0.003 and p=0.001 vs. p=0.045). We thus conclude that NRBF2 positively regulates autophagic activity and is particularly important for induced autophagy.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>WIPI2 structure formation depends on NRBF2</title><p id="P15">We established a &#x02018;revertant&#x02019; stable cell line expressing NRBF-CFP in NRBF2 KO background to examine the subcellular localization of NRBF2-CFP. Under normal conditions, NRBF2-CFP distribution is diffuse. Upon autophagy induction (HBSS buffer), NRBF2-CFP redistributes to puncta that are positive for WIPI2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Consistently, transient transfection of NRBF2-CFP in NRBF2 KO cells results in co-localization of NRBF2-CFP and WIPI2 in puncta that are also labeled with p62 upon autophagy induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Since deletion of NRBF2 decreases WIPI2-associated phagophore formation, we ask whether reintroduction of NRBF2 can rescue the defect. We transfected NRBF2 KO cells with NRBF2-CFP, NRBF2-CFP mutants or CFP and quantified WIPI2 puncta. NRBF2-CFP and dCCD-CFP mutant transfections cause a significant increase in the number of WIPI2 puncta compared to CFP transfection under both normal and HBSS conditions. In contrast, dMIT-CFP transfectants have similar numbers of WIPI2 puncta to the CFP transfected NRBF2 KO MEFs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h, i</xref>). The data suggests that expression of full length NRBF2 or dCCD mutant rescues impaired WIPI2 formation in NRBF2 KO MEFs. Thus the MIT domain of NRBF2, but not the CCD, is critical for the formation of WIPI2-associated phagophores after autophagy induction.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Role of NRBF2 in modulating UVRAG-linked Vps34 activity</title><p id="P17">We examined the role of NRBF2 in autophagosome maturation by using the tandem reporter mCherry-GFP-LC3B<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.

Our results show that the number of red LC3 puncta per cell and red LC3 puncta percentage are both reduced in NRBF2 KO MEFs under normal conditions.

This finding demonstrates impaired autophagosome maturation in the absence of NRBF2, particularly under autophagy induction. Moreover, we found that RFP-LC3 puncta rarely recruited the lysosomal marker LAMP2 in NRBF2 KO MEFs expressing RFP-LC3, whereas RFP-LC3 labeled autophagosomes have extensive overlap with LAMP2 in WT MEFs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Because the reduced Atg14L-linked Vps34 activity may not explain the impaired autophagy maturation in NRBF2 KO cells, we then asked whether NRBF2 regulates UVRAG-associated Vps34 activity, which is known to regulate autophagosome maturation. In fact, our study revealed a weak interaction between NRBF2 and UVRAG (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, g</xref>). We evaluated UVRAG-linked Vps34 activity like we did for Atg14L by transfecting Myc-Vps34/Vps15-His, FLAG-UVRAG and NRBF2-CFP or CFP, followed by IP with anti-FLAG antibody and measuring precipitated Vps34 activity. The result showed that the FLAG-UVRAG-linked Vps34 activity is significantly higher in the presence of overexpressed NRBF2-CFP than control CFP (<italic>P</italic> value 0.009) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>).

We performed Western blotting to examine the total protein levels of Vps34, Vps15, Beclin 1, UVRAG, and Atg14L in NRBF2 WT and KO mice brain lysates. We found little change in basal protein levels between NRBF2 WT and KO mice (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>). However, using anti-Vps34 antibody to pull down Vps34 proteins, we found that Vps34 binds markedly less Atg14L in NRBF2 KO MEFs (&#x02248;75% decrease compared to WT mice). Vps34 also binds less Vps15 (&#x02248;35% reduced) and Beclin 1 (&#x02248;40% reduced) in KO mice. In contrast, Vps34-associated UVRAG are similar between NRBF2 WT and KO mice. Measurment of the activity of Vps34 IP product shows a decrease in PI(3)P production in NRBF2 KO mice (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a, b</xref>).

This result suggests that NRBF2 has little effect on Beclin 1-Atg14L complex formation, but plays a role in Vps34-Vps15-Beclin 1-Atg14L complex assembly by bringing Vps15 and -Atg14L-bound Beclin 1 to Vps34. To evaluate the role of Vps15 in this context we co-expressed NRBF2-CFP and Myc-Vps34 with or without Vps15-V5-His in HEK293T cells, IPed the transfected cell lysates with anti-Myc antibody and measured PI(3)P production. The results show that NRBF2-CFP expression has no effect on Vps34 activity in the absence of Vps15-V5-His. In contrast, in the presence of Vps15-V5-His, NRBF2-CFP expression drastically enhances the Vps34 kinase activity comparing to CFP control (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8d</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>) suggesting that Vps15 is required for NRBF2&#x02019;s effect on Vps34 kinase activity.

It is worth mentioning that, distinct from GFP-tagged Beclin 1, Atg14L, UVRAG or Rubicon, overexpression of NRBF2-CFP causes enhanced Vps34 activity when co-expressing Myc-Vps34 and Vps15-His in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Taken together, our data suggests a critical role for NRBF2 in assembling specific PI3K-III complex by recruiting the subcomplex Beclin 1-Atg14L and Vps15 to Vps34, creating a highly active PI3K-III kinase complex.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S13"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P25">Our study identifies NRBF2 as a new component in the Beclin 1-Vps34 complex and a critical modulator of PI3K-III activity in autophagy regulation. Thus it adds a new member to the growing list of Beclin 1-Vps34 binding partners that regulate cellular functions of PI3K-III. Previous studies reported NRBF2 within the network of the human autophagy system<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and in the association with SCOC, a Golgi protein involved in starvation-induced autophagy<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, hinting at its role in autophagy. But the exact function of NRBF2 in autophagy remains uncharacterized. Our study not only reveals the function of NRBF2 in autophagy regulation, but also demonstrates its role in suppressing ER stress-induced apoptotic death and liver necrosis.</p><p id="P26">Beclin 1-Vps34-Vps15 is the conserved core component of PI3K-III complex, which binds either Atg14L or UVRAG tightly and thus forms multiple stable PI3K-III complexes. These stable complexes are the essential functional units that dictate various cellular functions of PI3K-III<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Our identification of NRBF2 through two independent affinity purification procedures (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>) suggests that NRBF2 is also a stable constituent in the Beclin 1-Vps34 complex. Our data demonstrates that NRBF2 directly binds Atg14L to associate with Beclin 1, Vps34 and Vps15 proteins and modulates Atg14L-linked Vps34 kinase activity. Thus, we conclude that NRBF2 is an integral part of the Atg14L-associated PI3K-III complex that plays a role in autophagy initiation. While this manuscript was in revision, a report showed that the yeast protein Atg38, which shares sequence homology to NRBF2, binds yeast Atg14 and regulates Vps34 activity via its MIT domain<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Thus, our study demonstrates that NRBF2 is mammalian homologue of yeast Atg38 and the function of Atg38/NRBF2 in controlling Atg14L-linked Vps34 kinase activity is evolutionarily conserved.</p><p id="P27">Our study provides insight into the mechanism whereby NRBF2 modulates specific PI3K-III kinase complex activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data suggests that NRBF2 plays a critical role in assembling the Vps34-Vps15-Beclin 1-Atg14L complex by linking the subcomplex Beclin 1-Atg14L and Vps15 to the catalytic subunit Vps34 in tissues for a highly functional PI3K-III kinase complex (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8e</xref>). We notice that NRBF2 is neither important for Beclin 1-Atg14L subcomplex formation nor critical for UVRAG binding to Vps34. In contrast, NRBF2 is crucial for the Vps15-Vps34 stable interaction and optimal Vps34 lipid kinase activity<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. This evidence suggests that NRBF2 may modulate Vps15-mediated Vps34 activity independent of Atg14L.</p><p id="P28">Indeed, unlike Atg14L, NRBF2 seems to interact with UVRAG, a component in a distinct Beclin 1-Vps34 complex exclusive of Atg14L, though the binding is weaker compared to NRBF2&#x02019;s binding to Atg14L (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, g</xref>). UVRAG-linked Vps34 activity is known to regulate autophagy maturation<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we find that NRBF2-deficient MEFs have a reduced number of mature autophagosomes, suggesting the involvement of NRBF2 in autophagy maturation. Consistently, increased NRBF2 levels facilitate UVRAG-linked Vps34 kinase activity. Therefore, our data suggests that NRBF2 is a distinct modulator of Vps34 activity throughout the autophagy process.</p><p id="P29">The characterization of NRBF2 KO mice clearly shows that <italic>Nrbf2</italic> is not an essential gene. Indeed, no mortality is observed in NRBF2 KO mice for at least 12 months and they appear largely normal. The observation is in contrast to that of KO mice for Vps34<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, Beclin 1<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> or Atg14L (our unpublished data), each of which is embryonic lethal. Furthermore, ablation of genes for autophagy conjugation components, such as <italic>Atg3</italic>, <italic>Atg5</italic>, or <italic>Atg7</italic>, causes perinatal death in mice<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, indicating a developmental role of autophagy. Conditional deletion of autophagy-related genes in a tissue-specific manner shows severe pathologies in the liver, including hepatomegaly, hepatic steatosis, liver tumors, and oxidative stress<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Interestingly, despite impaired Atg14L-linked Vps34 activity and turnover of the autophagic substrate p62 (e.g. in the liver), NRBF2 KO mice are spared of obvious developmental blocks and they survive normally. Therefore, it is likely that NRBF2 KO mice retain some autophagic activity. Indeed, our study demonstrates that Atg14L-linked Vps34 protein levels and lipid kinase activity were reduced by 75% in NRBF2 KO tissues. The remaining 25% activity of the Atg14L-Vps34 kinase complex is perhaps able to sustain basal requirement of autophagy function in many cells or tissues. This notion is also supported by the fact that NRBF2 KO livers show mild lesions associated with focal necrosis, inflammation, isolated apoptotic hepatocytes, and activated Nrf2 pathway. Thus, it is unlikely that NRBF2 plays an essential role in basal autophagy, particularly under normal conditions. We conclude that NRBF2 is a key factor for modulating the capacity of Vps34 activity in response to various stresses that induce autophagy.</p><p id="P30">Finally, our data reveals an important function of NRBF2 in protecting cells from ER-stress-induced cell death, consistent with its significant role in condition-specific autophagy modulation rather than in basal autophagy regulation. The result may implicate NRBF2 in the regulation of biochemical activity or cellular function of p62, which is a multi-faceted adaptor protein for an array of cellular processes, including the UPS, autophagy, and apoptosis<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P31">In summary, our study identifies NRBF2 as a key modulator of PI3K-III activity by stabilizing Beclin 1, Atg14L, Vps34 and Vps15 proteins in the assembly of highly-active PI3K-III kinase complexes.

After being pulse-labelled for 24 h, cells were washed three times and cultured in DMEM supplemented with excess unlabelled leucine (5 mM) for 16 h to chase out short-lived proteins. Cells were then washed three times and further cultured for 4 h in DMEM, Earle&#x02019;s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS), or EBSS supplemented with 100 nM Wortmannin, all containing unlabelled leucine (5 mM). Both medium and cell lysates were subject to TCA precipitation. Long-lived protein degradation was calculated as the ratio of TCA soluble medium to TCA-precipitated cell lysate radioactivity.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Generation of AcGFP-NRBF2 HeLa inducible cell line</title><p id="P44">HeLa cells inducibly expressing AcGFP-NRBF2 was obtained using pTet-On Advanced system following the protocol manufacturer provided (Clontech Laboratories, Mount view, CA). In brief, HeLa cells were firstly transfected with pTet-On Advanced Vector and selected withG418 to generate a stable Tet-On Advanced cell line. This cell line serves as the host for a TRE-Tight expression vector, which is transfected into the Tet-On Advanced cell line along with a linear Hygromycin marker. AcGFP-NRBF2 was inserted into MCS of TRE-Tight vector. After a second round of drug selection, a stable cell line is produced which expresses high level of the AcGFP-NRBF2 in response to doxycycline (Dox).</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P45">The values were expressed as mean&#x000b1;SEM and <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.05 were considered significant. To analyze the differences between two groups, unpaired t test was used if the distribution of value passed the normality test, otherwise mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used. For data normalized with control group (Control is 1), one sample t test against hypothetical value 1 was used to compare the difference between other group and control group. For multiple group comparison, if data pass the normal distribution test and homogeneity of variance test, multiple t test followed by bonferroni correction or one way ANOVA was used to analyze differences, otherwise kruskal-wallis test was used to analyze differences. All the tests are two-sided. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 or SPSS 20.0 software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S28"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS587568-supplement-1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e940" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants (NIH-R01NS060123) to Z.Y.
