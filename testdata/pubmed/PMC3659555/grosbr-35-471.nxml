It has a variety of physiological and pharmacological effects. Recently, we isolated a subset of glycolipoproteins that we designated gintonin, and demonstrated that it induced transient change in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) in cells via G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway(s). The previous method for gintonin isolation included multiple steps using methanol, butanol, and other organic solvents. In the present study, we developed a much simple method for the preparation of gintonin from ginseng root using 80% ethanol extraction. The extracted fraction was designated edible gintonin. This method produced a high yield of gintonin (0.20%). The chemical characteristics of gintonin such as molecular weight and the composition of the extract product were almost identical as the gintonin prepared using the previous extraction regimen involving various organic solvents. We also examined the physiological effects of edible gintonin on endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel activity of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. The 50% effective dose was 1.03&#x000b1;0.3 &#x003bc;g/mL. Finally, since gintonin preparation through ethanol extraction is easily reproducible, gintonin could be commercially applied for ginseng-derived functional health food and/or drug following the confirmations of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> physiological and pharmacological effects of gintonin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd><italic>Panax ginseng</italic></kwd><kwd>Ginseng</kwd><kwd>Gintonin</kwd><kwd>Ethanol extraction</kwd><kwd>Edible gintonin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ginseng, the root of <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> Meyer, is a popular herbal medicine consumed as a functional health food globally throughout the world. The oldest Chinese herbal medicine book, Sheng-nong Ben-cao Jing, states that ginseng&#x02019;s beneficial effects include replenishment of vital energy, mood elevation, and longevity, and recent studies have revealed that it exhibits diverse physiological and pharmacological effects on nervous and non-nervous systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B001">[1]</xref>. However, knowledge of the molecular basis of the multiple pharmacological effects of ginseng is rudimentary.</p><p>Previously, we demonstrated that a crude ginseng total saponin (cGTS) fraction activated the endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>- activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel (CaCC) in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes via a G&#x003b1;<sub>q/11</sub>-phospholipase C&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-IP<sub>3</sub>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway and that repeated treatment with the cGTS fraction caused rapid desensitization of the CaCC via GRK2 and &#x003b2;-arrestin I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B002">[2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B004">4]</xref>. Recently, we isolated a novel glycolipoprotein fraction from the cGTS and named it gintonin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5]</xref>. Gintonin contains proteins with a high abundance of hydrophobic and acidic amino acids, and glucose is the main carbohydrate component. It also contains several fatty acids in ester form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5]</xref>. Interestingly, gintonin, but not ginseng saponin (also called ginsenoside), induced transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and activated CaCC in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes at very low concentration via the same pathway as the cGTS fraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5]</xref>. We demonstrated that active agents that caused CaCC activation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and transiently elevated the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) in mammalian cells are not ginsenosides but gintonin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5]</xref>. In addition, we found that the ginseng stem and leaf also contain gintonin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B006">[6]</xref>. Thus, we provided the evidence that ginseng contains novel ingredients and that one novel ingredient, gintonin, could also be the main agent for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated various cellular events.</p><p>However, the previous methods for crude gintonin preparation included multiple steps using various organic solvents such as methanol, butanol, and other harmful organic solvents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5]</xref>. In the present study, we developed a simple method for crude gintonin preparation from ginseng root using ethanol. Here, we report that this procedure could be produce edible gintonin with high yield. The present data indicate report shows the possibility that the edible gintonin could also be useful in functional health food/drug development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>BioLogic DuoFlow chromatography systems were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA).

Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a second messenger and is involved in numerous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent events such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzymes, ion channels, hormones and neurotransmitter release, and more, gintonin might participate a variety of cellular events. In previous reports, we have shown that ginseng can be extracted with various organic solvents such as methanol and butanol as a first step for gintonin preparation from ginseng root, stem, and leaf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B006">6]</xref>. For use of gintonin as a functional health food and/or drug, a new method of extraction that does not use harmful organic solvents is necessary. In the present study, we have developed a simple extraction protocol for gintonin preparation using ethanol. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F001">Fig. 1</xref>A, we first prepared 80% ethanol extract, directly applied to anion exchange column, eluted bound components by 1 M NaCl, and finally produced gintonin fraction with 0.2% yield. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F001">Fig. 1</xref>B, ethanol extract (100 &#x003bc;g/mL) of ginseng slightly induced a inward Cl<sup>-</sup> current by activating endogenous CaCC in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. The unbound components to column had no effect on CaCC activation, whereas the bound component (1 &#x003bc;g/mL) induced a large inward Cl<sup>-</sup> current by activating endogenous CaCC channels in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. These results indicate that the main component for CaCC activation is gintonin that carries charges and that unbound components, which might include ginsenosides and other uncharged or neutral components, had no effects on CaCC activity. Thus, we could prepare gintonin fraction activating CaCC with ethanol and called it edible gintonin fraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of molecular weight and gel filtration chromatography of edible gintonin</title><p>We next estimated the apparent molecular weight of edible gintonin fraction prepared from ginseng.

Again, these results indicated thatntonin prepared using ethanol is composed of glycolipoproteins.</p><fig id="F005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><title>GC-MS spectral analysis of lipid components of edible gintonin prepared from ginseng root.

The ED<sub>50</sub> was 1.03&#x000b1;0.3 &#x003bc;g/mL.

First, we showed that gintonin can be prepared using ethanol. Second, we also used a one-step extraction instead of previous multiple step extractions using methanol and butanol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B006">6]</xref>. This simplified method for gintonin preparation has at least three merits compared to previous methods. First, the newly developed method uses ethanol, which is permitted for use with functional food and/or drug preparation. Second, this method also requires less organic solvents than the previous methods, making mass production of gintonin conceivable. Third, the procedure for gintonin preparation using ethanol is easily reproducible.</p><p>We observed some similarities and differences in the present and previous gintonin. Their molecular weights in SDS-PAGE were almost same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F004">Fig. 4</xref>). In amino acid composition, edible gintonin also was shown to contain a high amount of hydrophobic amino acids such as phenyalanine, leucine, isoleucine, alanine, and proline, in agreement with the composition of the previously obtained gintonin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T001">Table 1</xref>). In carbohydrate compositions, glucose was predominant in both gintonin preparations obtained using ethanol and other organ solvents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T002">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, palmitic acid (C<sub>16:0</sub>) was the major lipid component in edible gintonin followed by linoleic acid (C<sub>18:2</sub>), whereas linoleic acid was dominant one and followed by palmitic acid (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T003">Table 3</xref>). In addition, we observed the presence of some minor components (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T003">Table 3</xref>). The discrepancy in lipid content between present and previous gintonin might be derived from batch-to-batch variability and from different sources of ginseng cultivation. Further studies will be needed to establish standardization of gintonin in lipid content.</p><p>In previous studies we demonstrated that gintonin induced CaCC activation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes through the mobilization of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B006">6]</xref>. When we compared the potency for endogenous CaCC activation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes with the previously acquired extract, we found that ethanol gintonin was not much different from that of previous gintonin for the activation of CaCC. These results indicate that ethanol used for gintonin extraction at least did not affect gintonin activity for CaCC activations and also that ethanol could be used for mass production of gintonin for application as a functional health food and/or drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have developed a simple method for edible gintonin preparation using ethanol. The composition of edible gintonin and physiological activity of edible gintonin for CaCC activation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes through intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization was almost same with that of previous ginotonin prepared by other organic solvents. Since elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level as a second messenger plays an important role for variety of cellular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B009">[9]</xref>, the present method for edible gintonin could be further applied for functional health food and/or drug development.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by Konkuk University in
