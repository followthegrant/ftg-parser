Here, we show that DOT1L, an enzyme involved in histone methylation, is a master protector of cartilage health. Loss of DOT1L disrupts the molecular signature of healthy chondrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and causes osteoarthritis in mice. Mechanistically, the protective function of DOT1L is attributable to inhibition of Wnt signalling, a pathway that when hyper-activated can lead to joint disease. Unexpectedly, DOT1L suppresses Wnt signalling by inhibiting the activity of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), an important regulator of gene transcription. Inhibition of SIRT1 protects against osteoarthritis triggered by loss of DOT1L activity. Modulating the DOT1L network might therefore be a therapeutic approach to protect the cartilage against osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>DOT1L is one of the few genes linked to osteoarthritis by human GWAS. Here the authors show that DOT1L-dependent histone methylation protects homeostasis of articular chondrocytes by SIRT1-dependent inhibition of canonical WNT signalling, and that inhibition of DOT1L can drive osteoarthritic disease in mice.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Articular cartilage is an essential component of our joints and critical for normal mobility. This cartilage contains a unique cell-type, the articular chondrocyte, which is embedded in self-produced extracellular matrix composed mainly of type 2 collagen fibres and proteoglycan aggrecan. Osteoarthritis, the most common joint disease, is characterized by progressive damage to the articular cartilage. In osteoarthritis, the chondrocytes die or lose their highly specialized molecular characteristics, resulting in the production of an extracellular matrix that is biomechanically inferior, contributing to progressive tissue damage and loss of joint function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Thus, this age-related or trauma-triggered progressive disease poses a medical health threat and debilitates affected patients. Current therapy is limited to symptom relief and in severe cases joint replacement surgery; interventions that arrest or reverse disease progression are entirely lacking and therefore indicate a large unmet medical need<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Effective anti-osteoarthritic drugs should maintain cartilage homeostasis and structural integrity, but the central molecular regulators of these processes are unknown, precluding the development of effective, safe treatments.</p><p>The Disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (<italic>DOT1L</italic>) gene encodes a histone methyltransferase that methylates lysine-79 of histone H3 (H3K79) and is involved in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Genome-wide association studies showed that common single variants in the <italic>DOT1L</italic> gene, with minor allele frequencies of 0.20&#x02013;0.40, protect against osteoarthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However, it is unknown how DOT1L affects this devastating disease.</p><p>In this study, we identify DOT1L as a regulator of cartilage health and disease. Loss of DOT1L disrupts cartilage homeostasis and triggers the development of osteoarthritis. Furthermore, DOT1L preserves cartilage health by preventing the hyper-activation of Wnt signalling through negative regulation of SIRT1. Overall, our data demonstrate the importance of the DOT1L/SIRT1 axis in maintaining cartilage health and provides a rationale for potential therapeutic interventions in the treatment of osteoarthritis.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Loss of DOT1L activity disrupts chondrocyte homeostasis</title><p>To study whether cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis is related to changes in DOT1L activity, we performed immunohistochemistry of DOT1L-methylated H3K79 on cartilage from non-osteoarthritic trauma patients and on preserved and damaged regions of cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This analysis revealed that the immunoreactive signal of methylated H3K79 was decreased i`n damaged areas from patients with osteoarthritis as compared to their corresponding preserved areas and to control cartilage. In contrast, <italic>DOT1L</italic> gene expression did not differ between damaged or preserved cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis (average fold change in damaged <italic>versus</italic> preserved cartilage 0.992 (s.e.m. 0.064), <italic>n</italic>=4 patients, with three technical replicates). These observations suggest that DOT1L activity positively correlates with cartilage health.</p><p>We next sought to determine if DOT1L regulates transcriptional programs that maintain the unique molecular signature of the articular chondrocyte. To address this question, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> model in which freshly isolated healthy human articular chondrocytes are cultured and serially passaged in monolayer, thereby losing their molecular characteristics, as it occurs in osteoarthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In this osteoarthritis-like dedifferentiation process, the expression of chondrocyte markers such as type 2 collagen (<italic>COL2A1</italic>) and aggrecan (<italic>ACAN</italic>) is lost, while fibroblast markers such as type 1 collagen (<italic>COL1A1</italic>) are upregulated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. We examined how DOT1L inhibition affects gene expression changes triggered in this model. When the articular chondrocytes were expanded and passaged while treated with the specific DOT1L inhibitor EPZ-5676, H3K79 methylation was successfully abrogated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>). DOT1L inhibition enhanced the osteoarthritis-like gene expression changes, for example, augmenting loss of <italic>COL2A1</italic> and gain of <italic>COL1A1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). These results suggest that the methyltransferase plays a role in maintaining the molecular identity of the healthy articular chondrocyte.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> loss of DOT1L activity triggers osteoarthritis</title><p>We then studied whether loss of DOT1L activity <italic>in vivo</italic> triggers osteoarthritis, by intra-articular injection of EPZ-5676 into the knees of adult mice. H3K79 methylation was effectively inhibited by EPZ-5676 in articular chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We observed increased cartilage damage by histology 2 and 4 weeks after EPZ-5676 injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). There were no differences between the groups in severity of synovitis or extent of subchondral bone remodelling, tissues that are known to show other features of osteoarthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that DOT1L preserves articular cartilage homeostasis, protecting it against osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DOT1L limits Wnt signalling to maintain cartilage homeostasis</title><p>To understand the mechanism by which DOT1L controls cartilage homeostasis and to identify effector signalling pathways, we performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis in healthy human articular chondrocytes treated with EPZ-5676 or vehicle (geonr: GSE77916). Microarray results and subsequent qPCR validation confirmed the induction of osteoarthritis-like gene expression changes upon DOT1L blockade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Comparative pathway analyses of differentially regulated transcripts after EPZ-5676 treatment revealed an enrichment in genes associated with Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Additional analyses highlighted the diverse regulatory role of DOT1L and further supported the links with skeletal biology and disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b,c</xref>).</p><p>Tight regulation of Wnt signalling is key to cartilage health as both insufficient and excessive high levels have been associated with osteoarthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Upon Wnt ligand binding to Fizzled receptors and co-receptors including low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5/6, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin is rescued from proteasomal degradation, accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus, where it associates with transcription factors from the TCF/LEF family. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that DOT1L interacts with <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin, the key signalling molecule in the Wnt cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p>To find out how DOT1L affects Wnt signalling, we determined the effects of DOT1L inhibition on the activation of this pathway in healthy human articular chondrocytes and in mouse models. In Wnt reporter-transfected cells, EPZ-5676 increased the luciferase activity when the Wnt signalling pathway was activated by LiCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). However, DOT1L inhibition did not induce detectable changes in active <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin levels in human articular chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) or in the articular cartilage of EPZ-5676-injected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). This suggests that DOT1L regulates Wnt signalling downstream of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin stabilization. Effectively, messenger RNA levels of direct Wnt target genes (<italic>LEF1</italic>, <italic>TCF1</italic> and <italic>c-MYC</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> increased after DOT1L inhibition in LiCl-treated chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Likewise, DOT1L knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) led to upregulation of these Wnt target genes in LiCl-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). In another set-up of Wnt signalling pathway activation using recombinant Wnt3a protein, DOT1L inhibition also resulted in increased Wnt target gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). EPZ-5676 also augmented levels of these Wnt targets in the dedifferentiation assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, increased Wnt target gene expression was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry of TCF1 in adult mouse articular cartilage after DOT1L inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that DOT1L restrains active Wnt signalling in cartilage.</p><p>To show that hyper-activation of Wnt signalling is the main mechanism responsible for the pathological effects of DOT1L loss of activity in articular cartilage, we assessed whether the Wnt inhibitor XAV-939 counteracts the effects of EPZ-5676 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In healthy human articular chondrocytes, XAV-939 treatment rescued the loss of <italic>ACAN</italic>, <italic>COL2A1</italic> and the increase of <italic>COL1A1</italic> triggered by DOT1L inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Likewise, <italic>in vivo</italic>, Wnt inhibition by XAV-939 also protected mice from EPZ-5676-induced osteoarthritic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Thus, hyper-activation of Wnt signalling is the major deleterious downstream effect of loss of DOT1L activity in cartilage.</p><p>Chondrocytes are also found in the growth plate cartilage, a transient tissue that becomes gradually replaced by bone during skeletal development and growth. In developmental bone formation and in the growth plate, active Wnt signalling has an important role in terminal differentiation of these chondrocytes towards hypertrophic cells. These cells express type X collagen (COLX), upregulate matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and produce a calcified extracellular matrix. In osteoarthritis, hyper-activation of Wnt signalling is associated with ectopic hypertrophic differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Altered matrix composition and factors secreted by these hypertrophic-like articular chondrocytes, such as MMP-13, likely contribute to cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. We detected increased immunohistochemical staining of COLX and MMP-13 in the articular cartilage of EPZ-5676-injected mice, particularly in the vicinity of lesions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b,c</xref>). Thus, DOT1L also protects against osteoarthritis by preventing Wnt-associated ectopic chondrocyte hypertrophy in the articular cartilage.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DOT1L controls Wnt activity by negative regulation of SIRT1</title><p>To investigate whether DOT1L directly regulates the Wnt pathway at the transcriptional level, we studied the binding of DOT1L to and its activity on different Wnt target genes in human articular chondrocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) demonstrated that DOT1L and methylated H3K79 bound to <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>TCF1,</italic> but not to <italic>c-MYC</italic> genes around the transcriptional start site (TSS) in response to Wnt pathway activation with either LiCl or Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). The binding strongly decreased upon EPZ-5676 treatment or siRNA-mediated DOT1L knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Loss of H3K79 methylation was accompanied by higher levels of acetylated H3K9 and trimethylated H3K4, histone marks associated with active transcription, at the <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>TCF1</italic>, but not <italic>c-MYC</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Thus, DOT1L acts as a direct negative regulator of Wnt target genes in chondrocytes.</p><p>We next sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which DOT1L negatively regulates Wnt signalling in cartilage. We hypothesized that DOT1L interacts with a repressor to restrict Wnt target gene expression. To test our hypothesis, we assessed whether knockdown of potential repressor candidates mimicked the effects of DOT1L inhibition in LiCl-treated human articular chondrocytes. As candidates, we evaluated AF4, AF5 and AF10, which are known DOT1L binding partners in leukaemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> with reported roles in gene repression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> or as enhancers of DOT1L effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. We also considered as candidates BCOR, SIRT1 and CBX8, proteins earlier identified in DOT1L complexes by mass spectrometry, with a known role as transcriptional repressors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Silencing of any of these candidates did not upregulate <italic>LEF1</italic> or <italic>TCF1</italic> expression in Wnt-activated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Therefore, we did not further consider their possible role as transcriptional repressors in interaction with DOT1L.</p><p>Surprisingly, in DOT1L-inhibited cells, we found that silencing of <italic>SIRT1</italic> blocked the upregulation of <italic>LEF1, TCF1</italic> but not <italic>c-MYC</italic> observed after DOT1L inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Likewise, the SIRT1 specific inhibitor EX527 rescued the upregulation of <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>TCF1</italic> triggered by DOT1L inhibition in LiCl-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). In contrast, pharmacological activation of SIRT1 with SRT1720 in LiCl/EPZ-5676-treated cells further upregulated <italic>LEF1, TCF1</italic> but not <italic>c-MYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). These unexpected results prompted us to consider that SIRT1 drives Wnt hyper-activation upon DOT1L blockade in chondrocytes.</p><p>We next investigated the mechanism by which SIRT1 increases Wnt target gene expression upon DOT1L inhibition. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that DOT1L and SIRT1 interacted at the protein level in human articular chondrocytes and this interaction was disrupted by DOT1L inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Notably, we found that DOT1L inhibition increased the enzymatic activity of SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). DOT1L knockdown using siRNA likewise resulted in enhanced SIRT1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). However, since ChIP-qPCR showed no SIRT1 protein occupancy at the DOT1L-identified Wnt target genes upon DOT1L inhibition in our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>), we hypothesized that SIRT1&#x02019;s effects may be accomplished by downstream chromatin binding factors. We therefore focused on PPARGC1A, GCN5 and EP300, transcriptional activators linked to the SIRT1 network<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Silencing of these factors mimicked SIRT1 silencing and partially blocked <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>TCF1</italic> but not <italic>c-MYC</italic> upregulation by EPZ-5676 in LiCl-treated chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>). ChIP-qPCR demonstrated strong enrichment for PPARGC1A and to a lesser extent for GCN5 at the <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>TCF1</italic> promoters after EPZ-5676 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). Furthermore, the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 that rescued EPZ-5676 effects on Wnt targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>), reduced the occupancy of PPARGC1A and GCN5 at <italic>LEF1</italic> and <italic>TCF1</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). Thus, these results indicate that increased SIRT1 activity upon DOT1L inactivation induces chromatin binding of transcriptional activators and promotes the upregulation of Wnt target genes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>SIRT1 blockade prevents EPZ-5676-induced osteoarthritis</title><p>We then examined the therapeutic implications of our findings, and explored the therapeutic potential of blocking SIRT1 in preventing osteoarthritis triggered by DOT1L inactivation. We therefore intra-articularly co-injected the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 and the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ-5676. Pharmacological blockade of SIRT1 effectively reduced the severity of osteoarthritis caused by the DOT1L inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>), and reversed the hyper-activation of Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Thus, we discovered that modulation of SIRT1 activity is a leading mechanism by which DOT1L controls activation of Wnt signalling, maintains cartilage health and prevents osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Loss of DOT1L causes severe growth retardation in mice</title><p>The DOT1L inhibitor EPZ-5676 is currently under clinical investigation as a potential treatment for MLL-rearranged leukaemia in adults and children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Our loss of function data in the articular cartilage resulting in osteoarthritis suggest that specific attention should be given to cartilage in patients treated with DOT1L inhibitors. Of note, polymorphisms in the <italic>DOT1L</italic> gene are not only associated with osteoarthritis but also with height<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. To assess whether loss of DOT1L has also an impact on growth plate chondrocytes and may influence growth in children treated with DOT1L inhibitors, we bred floxed <italic>Dot1l</italic> mice (<italic>Dot1l</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>) with a <italic>Col2-cre</italic> deleter mouse strain to obtain specific recombination in chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Cartilage-specific <italic>Dot1l</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Dot1l</italic><sup><italic>Cart-KO</italic></sup> mice) did not show apparent skeletal abnormalities but displayed severe growth retardation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Histology of the growth plates demonstrated a reduced and disorganized proliferative and prehypertrophic zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Increased Wnt pathway activation in the absence of DOT1L was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry of TCF1 in the articular cartilage and growth plate of <italic>Dot1l</italic><sup><italic>Cart-KO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f,g</xref>), with no detectable changes in <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a,b</xref>). The pattern and the intensity of the immunoreactive signal for COLX was different in the growth plate of <italic>Dot1l</italic><sup><italic>Cart-KO</italic></sup> mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8d</xref>). Of note, COLX levels also appeared to be increased in the articular cartilage of <italic>Dot1l</italic><sup><italic>Cart-KO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8c</xref>). Similarly, MMP-13 levels appeared to be increased in the articular cartilage of <italic>Dot1l</italic><sup><italic>Cart-KO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8e</xref>) but not in the growth plate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8f</xref>). Hence, these <italic>in vivo</italic> data demonstrate that DOT1L not only regulates cartilage homeostasis but also skeletal growth, and caution against undesired growth effects when DOT1L inhibitors are used in children.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that DOT1L safeguards the homeostasis of the articular cartilage and protects against osteoarthritis. We propose a new signalling model in cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>) linking Wnt activation with recruitment of DOT1L multi-protein complexes to Wnt target genes such as <italic>TCF1</italic> and <italic>LEF1</italic>. Under normal conditions, DOT1L prevents Wnt hyper-activation by negative modulation of SIRT1, thereby maintaining cartilage homeostasis. Upon DOT1L loss of function, DOT1L complexes disassemble, SIRT1 activity increases and transcriptional activators are recruited in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Wnt target gene expression strongly increases, and triggers loss of cartilage homeostasis, <italic>in vivo</italic> resulting in osteoarthritis. Interestingly, in the joint, the effects of DOT1L on Wnt signalling appear to be cell-specific for chondrocytes as these were absent in osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p>In genome-wide association studies, polymorphisms in the <italic>DOT1L</italic> gene were linked with cartilage thickness and osteoarthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, as well as with height<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. We earlier demonstrated that silencing of <italic>Dot1l</italic> in mouse chondroprogenitor cells negatively influences chondrogenic differentiation and that DOT1L interacts with Wnt pathway transcription factor TCF4 in these cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. An interaction between Wnt signalling molecule <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-catenin and DOT1L was further demonstrated in human cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, in mouse intestinal crypts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, in colorectal cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, in drosophila<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and in zebrafish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Remarkably, and in sharp contrast with our observations in the articular chondrocytes, DOT1L and H3K79 methylation have been mostly linked to increased Wnt target gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Our observation that DOT1L prevents the deleterious hyper-activation of Wnt signalling in articular chondrocytes highlights that the regulatory effects of DOT1L on gene expression are strongly tissue and context dependent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, thereby opening opportunities for highly specific interventions.</p><p>A fine-tuned balance of Wnt activity is considered indispensable for cartilage and joint homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Both excessive activation and lack of Wnt signalling in the joint result in cartilage breakdown and osteoarthritis in animal models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Our new paradigm proposes that DOT1L can act as a brake to contain the hyper-activation of the Wnt signalling cascade but does not fully inhibit its physiological role. A similar function has recently been described for WNT16. Nalesso <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> suggest that WNT16 prevents excessive Wnt activation in articular cartilage by acting as a partial agonist of this cascade, thereby competing for receptor binding with a full agonist. We also earlier demonstrated that lack of extracellular Wnt antagonist frizzled-related protein increases the severity of osteoarthritis in mouse models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Thus, our novel data on DOT1L as a critical modulator of the Wnt cascade add another level of complexity to the regulation of Wnt signalling in the articular cartilage: in addition to extracellular agonists and antagonists, the Wnt cascade is also tightly controlled at the chromatin level. The cell-specificity of our findings suggests that this epigenetic mechanism may be a more precise therapeutic target as compared to extracellular modulators.</p><p>The factors that regulate DOT1L activity in the articular cartilage remain unknown and are an important area for further research. We did not detect differences in <italic>DOT1L</italic> gene expression levels between damaged or preserved cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis. However, this does not exclude transcriptional control as a mechanism to regulate DOT1L activity. In osteoarthritis, articular chondrocytes are not a uniform population and their health status may determine the expression of <italic>DOT1L</italic> at the individual cell level. Interestingly, some evidence suggests that pro-inflammatory signals activating NFkB signalling increase <italic>DOT1L</italic> expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. This may be a compensatory mechanism to promote DOT1L activity and has been linked to ageing. Nevertheless, our data in the patient cartilage samples suggest that regulation of DOT1L activity is the main mechanism to control H3K79 methylation and its effects on gene transcription. The intrinsic catalytic activity of DOT1L is considered relatively low and the limited number of DOT1L molecules in the cells does not match the high number of histones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Thus, DOT1L should be directed to and activated at particular stretches of the DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. For instance, trans-histone cross-talk with ubiquitination at H2B not only interacts with DOT1L but contributes to the positioning of the enzyme to optimize H3K79 methylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Cumulative data suggest that there is no specific demethylase for H3K79 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Thus, demethylation of H3K79 appears to be largely due to histone renewal and cell division.</p><p>Our results identify a critical interaction between DOT1L and SIRT1 in articular chondrocytes. SIRT1 is a deacetylase with effects on epigenetic regulation of gene expression as well as other molecules, thus influencing different pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. We detected protein&#x02013;protein interactions between DOT1L and SIRT1 in the transcriptional complex assembling upon activation of Wnt signalling. Within these complexes, DOT1L negatively regulates SIRT1 activity. Again, the downstream effects of the DOT1L-SIRT1 interaction appear to be strongly context-dependent. Whereas in chondrocytes inhibition of DOT1L results in increased Wnt signalling dependent on SIRT1, in DOT1L mediated mixed-lineage leukaemia, SIRT1 is part of an antitumoral repressive complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In the collecting ducts in the kidney, DOT1L and SIRT1 interact to suppress the expression of the epithelial Na(+) channel <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-subunit (<italic>alpha-ENaC</italic>). Inhibition of SIRT1 resulted in higher levels of <italic>alpha-ENaC</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p><p>The deleterious effects of SIRT1 reported in this study may appear to be in contrast with its perceived role in cartilage biology and osteoarthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Studies in genetic models have indicated that lack of SIRT1 activity in cartilage results in delayed growth and spontaneous osteoarthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, as well as increases the severity of osteoarthritis in the destabilization of the medial meniscus model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. SIRT1 activator resveratrol protects against osteoarthritis in the same model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. However, <italic>in vitro</italic>, this drug triggers chondrocyte hypertrophy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. This apparent discrepancy with our observations can be explained by the broad biological effects of SIRT1, including control of metabolism and mitochondrial activity. The deacetylase activity of SIRT1 is not limited to histone modifications but also affects other molecules in the cell, including transcription factors such as forkhead proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. In addition, in the absence of SIRT1, DOT1L activity and the composition of these multi-protein complexes may be altered, thereby potentially affecting its protective role in cartilage.</p><p>The severe growth retardation in <italic>Dot1l</italic><sup><italic>Cart-KO</italic></sup> mice remains intriguing. Further analysis suggests that the absence of <italic>Dot1l</italic> in chondrocytes disrupts the architecture of the growth plate with increased expression of COLX and MMP-13, markers of hypertrophic differentiation. Taking into account that we did not observe a role for DOT1L as a key regulator of Wnt signalling in primary osteoblasts, novel insights into the role of DOT1L in development and growth may result from experiments with other Cre-drivers such as <italic>Prx1</italic>. Obviously, specific attention should be given to growth retardation in children affected by leukaemia that are being treated with DOT1L inhibitors.</p><p>Further research will also be required to translationally validate the DOT1L/SIRT1 balance as a therapeutic target. Our different rescue and silencing experiments suggest specificity of the observed effects <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The severe growth phenotype in <italic>Dot1l</italic><sup><italic>Cart-KO</italic></sup> mice precludes their use in induced or ageing models of osteoarthritis. Inducible conditional models, for instance using a tamoxifen or doxicyclin dependent collagen type II or aggrecan Cre-driver, may overcome these issues, although leakiness or postnatal activity loss of the Cre transgenes can be a limitation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Nevertheless, such approaches will be necessary to further understand the role of DOT1L in joint disease, and more in particular in post-traumatic or ageing-associated osteoarthritis. Moreover, the association between polymorphisms in <italic>DOT1L</italic> and osteoarthritis has been most strongly demonstrated for hip osteoarthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Inducible tissue-specific genetic models may be useful to understand eventual differences between hip and knee disease.</p><p>In summary, our study provides novel information on DOT1L in mammalian gene regulation and identifies DOT1L as a key regulator of transcriptional programs essential for cartilage health. The balance between DOT1L and SIRT1 activity determines the activation of Wnt signalling in cartilage, with excessive pathway activity resulting in osteoarthritis. New epigenetics-based strategies, in particular those targeting the DOT1L network, could provide an innovative way for therapeutic modulation of Wnt signalling in joint disease and the development of effective treatments of osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Materials</title><p>The specific DOT1L inhibitor EPZ-5676 was obtained from Chemietek.

A mixture of purified and fragmented biotinylated cRNA and hybridization controls (Affymetrix) was hybridized on Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 arrays followed by staining and washing in a GeneChip fluidics station 450 (Affymetrix). To assess the raw probe signal intensities, chips were scanned using a GeneChip scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). The differentially expressed genes were explored with the limma package. Genes with nominal <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;0.05 were selected for the enrichment analysis.

On day 15, cells were plated into 24-well plates and they were transfected when they were 60&#x02013;70% confluent with mGFP control plasmid (Origene PS100040) and Super8X TOPFlash or Super8X FOPFlash (TOPFlash mutant control) (Addgene plasmids #12456 and #12457, respectively) for canonical Wnt signalling reporter using Lipofectamine LTX Reagent with PLUS Reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. After 24&#x02009;h, cells were treated with 20&#x02009;mM LiCl with or without 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;M EPZ-5676 and collected 24&#x02009;h later. Luciferase assay was performed using Promega Luciferase Assay system according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Briefly, cells were lysed with 400&#x02009;&#x003bc;l per well 1 &#x000d7; lysis buffer (E1531) and underwent two freeze-thaw cycles to ensure complete cell lysis. Afterwards, 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of cell lysate was transferred to opaque 96-well plates, and 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of Luciferase Assay Reagent was dispensed into the plate.

Briefly, cell samples were crosslinked by 1% formaldehyde for 10&#x02009;min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine to a 125&#x02009;mM final concentration. The fixed cells were lysed in SDS buffer, and the chromatin was fragmented by microccocal nuclease digestion. The sheared chromatin was incubated with antibodies against DOT1L (Bethyl, A300-954A; dilution 1:50), GCN5 (Santa Cruz, sc-20698; dilution 1:20), H3K4me3 (Abcam, ab8580; dilution 1:100), H3K9ac (Abcam, Ab4441; dilution 1:125), H3K79me2 (Abcam, Ab3594; dilution 1:100), EP300 (Abcam, ab14984, clone 3G230/NM-11), PPARGC1A (Santa Cruz, sc-13067; dilution 1:20), SIRT1 (Abcam, Ab12193; dilution 1:100) and recovered by binding to protein A/G agarose.

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size for the animal experiments as the initial intervention (EPZ-5676 treatment) was compared against a condition expected to be close to normal. Additional interventions served as recue for the EPZ-5676 effects. The experiments were not randomized. Statistical analyses were performed where appropriate with GraphPad Prism software. For two group analyses, Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test was used. For group analysis, one-way ANOVA with post hoc tests taking into account multiple comparisons were used. For repeated measurements two-way ANOVA was used analysing the effect of time, intervention and the interaction between time and intervention.
