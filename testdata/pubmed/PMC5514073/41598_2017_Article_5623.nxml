Whilst patients can achieve a 6% improvement in overall survival with Neo-Adjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC), many do not respond. Body fluid mutant DNA (mutDNA) may allow non-invasive identification of treatment failure. We collected 248 liquid biopsy samples including plasma, cell pellet (UCP) and supernatant (USN) from spun urine, from 17 patients undergoing NAC. We assessed single nucleotide variants and copy number alterations in mutDNA using Tagged-Amplicon- and shallow Whole Genome- Sequencing. MutDNA was detected in 35.3%, 47.1% and 52.9% of pre-NAC plasma, UCP and USN samples respectively, and urine samples contained higher levels of mutDNA (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.001). Longitudinal mutDNA demonstrated tumour evolution under the selective pressure of NAC e.g. in one case, urine analysis tracked two distinct clones with contrasting treatment sensitivity. Of note, persistence of mutDNA detection during NAC predicted disease recurrence (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003), emphasising its potential as an early biomarker for chemotherapy response.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Bladder Cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Approximately 25% of BC patients have Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC) at diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The presence of MIBC signifies aggressive disease with a significant risk of metastatic progression. Even after definitive treatment (e.g. radical cystectomy &#x02013; surgical removal of the bladder, adjacent organs and their lymphatic drainage) overall survival (OS) is on average 50% over 5 yrs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Meta-analyses show that cisplatin-based neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can improve 5-year absolute OS by 6%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Despite maximum treatment with NAC and radical cystectomy, many patients do not respond to NAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and MIBC patients often recur within 2 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Once disease has progressed outside the bladder, OS survival is traditionally poor. However, a number of new agents, including immunotherapy and targeted therapies, are being tested in large clinical trials. There are currently no verified predictive biomarkers of response to cisplatin based NAC in MIBC that could be utilised prospectively, though some studies have shown initial promise using gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or gene mutation status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, DNA repair status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> or detecting proteins identified by gene expression analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, biomarkers to predict outcome during NAC are lacking and the predictive capacity of cystoscopy or radiological examination is limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In patients not responding to NAC, definitive treatment could be expedited or other systemic treatments investigated in the neo-adjuvant setting. Of note, the recent success of immune checkpoint inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> provides a possible alternative non-cross-resistant systemic treatment for these patients and trials with checkpoint inhibitors have recently been initiated in the peri-operative setting.</p><p id="Par4">Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) offers a minimally-invasive means to monitor tumour status. The half-life of circulating cell-free DNA is reportedly less than 2 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and the allele fraction ratio of mutant:wild type DNA (AF) has been shown to reflect tumour burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The translational potential for mutant DNA in body fluids (mutDNA, so called as we analysed both cell-free DNA and cellular DNA) could be even greater in bladder cancer due to the possibility of monitoring mutDNA in urine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, a peripheral fluid that truly can be collected &#x02018;non-invasively&#x02019;. In BC, the close proximity of tumour to the peripheral fluid reservoir might be expected to lead to a greater accumulation of tumour derived DNA.</p><p id="Par5">Recent reports have shown that mutDNA is detectable in the plasma and the urine of patients with BC. Using the Affymetrix Oncoscan assay, Togneri <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that mutation profiles present in FFPE tumour specimens were mirrored in matched urinary samples from patients with Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Ward <italic>et al</italic>. used digital PCR (dPCR) and NGS to analyse the somatic mutation status of cell pellets obtained by centrifuging urine samples (UCP) in 120 primary bladder cancer patients and 89 patients post transurethral resection (TUR), and detected mutant DNA in 70% of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Birkenkamp-Demtr&#x000f6;der <italic>et al</italic>. detected mutant DNA in plasma and urine of patients with BC by sequencing tumour specimens to design personalised droplet dPCR probes for use in peripheral fluids. In 4/6 patients, personalised probes detected plasma ctDNA several months before clinical progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. These studies mostly focus on non-invasive BC, which are often driven by different pathways than MIBC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and none compared plasma, UCP and USN sampling methods.</p><p id="Par6">The application of mutDNA in BC represents an exciting opportunity for clinical impact in MIBC and, despite recent efforts, remains relatively unexplored. Here, we aimed to utilise a combination of Tagged-AMplicon Sequencing (TAm-Seq) and shallow Whole Genome Sequencing (sWGS) to interrogate the longitudinal dynamics of mutDNA found in peripheral samples from 17 patients with MIBC undergoing NAC. MutDNA presence and levels were compared between matching plasma, UCP and USN samples in order to determine the optimum sample type for mutDNA analysis. Furthermore, early mutDNA levels (i.e. from samples extracted pre-NAC and immediately before the second cycle of NAC) were correlated with response to NAC, as well as recurrence status. Finally, longitudinal analysis of all peripheral sample types was employed to track disease progression, and to identify tumour dynamics throughout NAC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient recruitment for longitudinal analysis of mutDNA kinetics</title><p id="Par7">Patients attending the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) for cisplatin-based NAC were recruited between March 2014 and October 2015.

Nonetheless, our data indicates an advantage in assessing both urine (UCP &#x00026; USN) and plasma for the comprehensive analysis of mutDNA in MIBC. Additionally, the observation that urinary AFs were higher than plasma AFs, suggests that the presence of mutDNA in urinary samples is due to direct tumour shedding. Beyond BC, this study confirms the role of sampling peripheral fluids in close proximity to diseased organs in order to improve the sensitivity of the detection of mutDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">Of potential clinical significance, we found that detection of mutDNA at the second cycle of NAC (2&#x02013;3 weeks after initiation of therapy, depending on the specific regimen) using our methods was indicative of early disease recurrence, with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 100%. We acknowledge that we have studied a small number of cases and with a relatively short follow-up period (possibly resulting in recurrence events being missed). However, it is noteworthy that MIBC often recurs within 2 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and our recurrence rates are comparable with published data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Our proof of principle study therefore encourages further large-scale investigation. In our series, the single false negative case was likely due to the narrow focus of our bladder-specific panel, since we only detected a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation in the TUR sample at low AF, which likely represents a minor sub-clone (similar to those described in patients 12 and 15). Analysis of additional targets, through the use of an expanded panel for targeted sequencing or by capture-based strategies (as has been used in other cancer types)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, may have identified alternative cancer pathway mutations in this patient. Whilst we attempted to overcome this by interrogating the wider cancer genome through CNA profiling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, we note that CNA analysis is limited to detecting mutDNA at ~5% mutant:wild type AF ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Alternatively, by applying only <italic>TP53</italic> detection to the USN of the 9 patients who had <italic>TP53</italic> mutations in their TUR, a focussed <italic>TP53</italic> urinary assay would have detected all 4 patients that recurred (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">If confirmed by larger studies, mutDNA detection in pre-NAC samples and in samples taken before the 2<sup>nd</sup> NAC cycle may be used to stratify patients into 3 groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Firstly, those that are negative at both time-points may have a low (or no) burden of disease after TUR. Secondly, those that have a positive pre-NAC sample but negative samples at the 2<sup>nd</sup> NAC cycle are benefiting from their NAC and subsequent definitive therapy. The final group of patients has detectable mutDNA at both time-points and often progresses. Patients in this group are not benefiting from NAC and should be considered for expedited definitive therapy or alternative systemic therapy (e.g. targeted therapy or immune checkpoint inhibition). The specific mutations arising (or persisting) during therapy may inform further therapeutic strategy. Analysis of the presence of mutDNA in samples from later time-points was also informative but, would be less clinically useful. An early decision on continuation of NAC would prevent administration of multiple cycles of toxic therapy that is not benefiting the patient (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>MutDNA analysis may help stratify patients with MIBC in the future. Based on our data, we have generated a model by which a patient&#x02019;s outcome can be predicted by mutDNA status before and during NAC. Specifically, mutDNA status may be used to stratify patients into 3 groups. Firstly, patients with undetectable mutDNA pre-NAC and during NAC, have a low (or no) burden of disease (green). Secondly, patients with detected mutDNA pre-NAC but with negative samples at the 2<sup>nd</sup> NAC cycle are likely to benefit from their NAC and subsequent definitive therapy (yellow). Finally, patients with mutDNA detected before and during NAC are unlikely to benefit from continued NAC and often progress (red). These patients should be considered for expedited definitive treatment or alternative treatments (e.g. targeted therapy or immune checkpoint inhibition).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_5623_Fig6_HTML" id="d29e2036"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par26">We provide the first description of tumour evolution through <italic>de novo</italic> mutation detection in urinary specimens. We hypothesise that the changes in the mutational profiles observed in these patients represent tumour evolution under the selective forces of surgery and NAC. This is exemplified by patient 15. It is likely that multiple clones were present initially, with analysis of initial urinary samples highlighting a dominant somatic profile consisting of <italic>TP53</italic> H193A and <italic>YAP1</italic> gain. Initiation of NAC allowed for the apparent emergence of a distinct (presumably NAC resistant) tumour clone, containing, <italic>TP53</italic> R273C, <italic>NFE2L2</italic> G31A and <italic>CDKN2A</italic> loss. Meanwhile the clone containing <italic>TP53</italic> H193A and <italic>YAP1</italic> gain mutations appears to respond well to NAC and recedes. Our data emphasises the presence of multiple concomitant tumour clones and, the importance of monitoring mutDNA with an entire sequencing panel (e.g. one targeting all of <italic>TP53</italic>), rather than relying on the detection of known mutations from matched tumour samples. In addition, though we cannot rule out the effects of tumour heterogeneity in biasing our radical cystectomy sample analysis, the equivalent longitudinal data from peripheral fluid samples suggests that a combined body fluid sampling method is capable of overcoming the effects of spatially distinct clones. Overall, our data demonstrates the strength and potential of mutDNA profiling for non-invasive monitoring of clonal dynamics throughout therapy.</p><p id="Par27">Our proof of principle study has several weaknesses. Patient numbers were small and thus firm clinical conclusions cannot be made. However, by comprehensively studying several biological samples per patient at various time-points during NAC, we were able to establish a detailed overview of mutDNA in BC and generate specific hypotheses that can now be tested in prospective, sufficiently-powered, clinical studies. In addition, although the presence of mutDNA at the second cycle of NAC was associated with clinical outcome, we found instances where patients with favorable outcome had mutDNA detected in samples at later time-points. At this point, it is unclear whether these findings are clinically meaningful. However, it is clear that patients with a favorable outcome tend to lose detectable presence of mutDNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Finally, the detection methods chosen have limitations in panel size, sequence depth and sensitivity. Although improvement is possible, we believe these represent a reasonable trade-off in comparison with methods like digital PCR (high coverage but few mutations analysed) and capture-based NGS assays (large gene panels but coverage limited by sequencing costs).</p><p id="Par28">Together with previous work, we have demonstrated the utility of urinary mutDNA analysis across the full spectrum of bladder cancer. Using multiple sample sources and complementary genetic techniques we have provided a more rigorous analysis of mutDNA. Furthermore, despite the small numbers of patients, our study highlights the important role that mutDNA analysis can have in predicting aggressive disease in MIBC and could offer an opportunity for patients to consider expedited definitive therapy or alternative regimens.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample Collection</title><p id="Par29">Approval according to national guidelines was obtained from the NKI Translational Research Board (N13KCM/CFMPB250) for the longitudinal analysis of mutDNA in MIBC.
