In 2008, it was estimated that 40% of the global population over the age of 25 had high blood pressure levels and that hypertension was related to 13% of the global death rate <xref rid="pone.0112875-World1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In Latin America, the burden of non-communicable diseases has led to an increase in the prevalence of hypertension and its related mortality which accounted for two thirds of all deaths by the year 2000, and thus establishing this disease as a public health concern in many geographic locations <xref rid="pone.0112875-Yusuf1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Perel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-MedinaLezama1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In Peru, it is considered the second cause of mortality and the eleventh cause of burden of disease with a prevalence ranging from 8% to 30% as reported by several local studies <xref rid="pone.0112875-MedinaLezama1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112875-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the worldwide availability of antihypertensive therapy, which has shown to be effective in decreasing the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke among other benefits <xref rid="pone.0112875-Law1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, only 25% of treated patients are able to achieve optimal blood pressure control and almost 50% quit their treatment within the first year <xref rid="pone.0112875-World2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The statistics are even more striking in developing countries such as Peru, where a study reported a rate of controlled hypertension of only 14% <xref rid="pone.0112875-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Several studies have shown that of the different factors contributing to poor blood pressure control, poor adherence is the primary one, which is also responsible for the decline in patients' quality of life and the squandering of health care system resources <xref rid="pone.0112875-Horne1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112875-Matsumura1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Adherence, defined as the extent to which a person's behavior corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider <xref rid="pone.0112875-World2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, has been recognized as a health care problem; especially among patients suffering chronic diseases which imply the need of interventions for long periods of time <xref rid="pone.0112875-Horne2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Jackevicius1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Certain barriers to adherence have been previously described as multifactorial. Some of them are related to the health system itself, which is difficult to modify, while others include those related to the patient's level of knowledge about the disease, as well as beliefs and attitudes towards medication, both general and specific to their conditions, which can be targeted by health care policies <xref rid="pone.0112875-Horne2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Buendia1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Haynes1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Some studies suggested that beliefs and perceptions regarding medication may have an important effect on adherence to treatment. In this way, increased positive beliefs such as necessity are linked to increased levels of adherence <xref rid="pone.0112875-Isaza1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Thus, it is critical to have a better understanding about the patient's beliefs about medications that could translate into poor adherence in order to focus interventional efforts on improving them in the future. This study was aimed to characterize the level of adherence to pharmacological medication and beliefs towards medication usage in a group of patients with hypertension in a large Peruvian hospital.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>Cross-sectional survey conducted among patients with an established diagnosis of hypertension attending the outpatient clinics at Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia (HNCH) during May and June 2012.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and Participants</title><p>HNCH is a 420-bed tertiary level, university affiliated national hospital located in the northern area of Lima, Peru. It is the primary referral hospital for the area and serves a population of approximately 3.5 million, mainly from low-income groups. HNCH has been designated by Peru's Ministry of Health as part of the selected group of national specialized hospitals to lead on the management and care of individuals with chronic conditions <xref rid="pone.0112875-Ministerio1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Adult patients in the waiting rooms of the cardiology and endocrinology clinics that admitted to have a medical diagnosis of hypertension and to take at least one anti-hypertensive medication were selected by convenience, targeted to achieve 120 participants over 8 weeks as a pilot study to inform future larger initiatives. Patients that were not responsible for their own medication or those not able to understand questionnaires were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcomes and Variables Definition</title><p>The primary outcome was adherence which was evaluated using the Spanish version of the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 questionnaire that defines low adherence to medications as scores &#x0003c;6 out of 8 points in the scale <xref rid="pone.0112875-Morisky1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-ValJimenez1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This tool has been used extensively to measure adherence in patients with hypertension in primary care settings and has a sensitivity and specificity for identifying low vs. higher adherers of 93% and 53%, respectively <xref rid="pone.0112875-Morisky1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>The primary exposure consisted of patients' beliefs towards usage of medication in general as well as their prescribed antihypertensive drugs.

This instrument simplifies the broad range of beliefs that individuals hold about pharmacological treatment into four domains: i) ideas of harm: beliefs that medicines are harmful, addictive, poisons which should not be taken continuously; ii) ideas of overuse for general medicines: beliefs that the medicines are overused by physicians; iii) ideas of concern: based on beliefs about the danger of dependence, long-term toxicity and the disruptive effects of medication; and iv) ideas of necessity which assess the individual's beliefs of need for prescribed medication <xref rid="pone.0112875-Horne1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Horne2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Horne3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The first two domains explore beliefs about medication in general, and the latter two about disease-specific conditions, in our case explored about hypertension. Items in each of the domains are rated with a Likert scale from 1 to 5 depending on the level of agreement; higher scores being linked to higher belief levels of harm, overuse, concern or necessity, respectively. Each of the four belief's domains was categorized into low or high, using cutoffs previously established <xref rid="pone.0112875-Horne3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. For harm, concern and necessity domains, scores may range between 5 and 25, considering &#x0003c;15 points as low; whereas scores for the overuse domain may range between 3 and 15 and &#x0003c;9 points was used to define low overuse levels.</p><p>Given that the necessity and concern beliefs are therapy-specific, a necessity minus concern differential was calculated as suggested by the BMQ's authors. This differential can serve as a useful approach to identify the relationship between beliefs of necessity and concerns about the same medication in an individual basis i.e. in patient X, necessity beliefs outweigh concerns or vice versa. The scores for the differential may range between &#x02212;25 and 25 and scores &#x0003c;0, negative values, were considered as low necessity-concern indicating that the patient had more concerns than ideas of need toward antihypertensive medications <xref rid="pone.0112875-Horne3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Other participant characteristics recorded include age, sex, educational level, length and frequency of administration of anti-hypertensive drugs, and total number of medications taken per day irrespective of their diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data Collection</title><p>Data were collected through a face-to-face encounter.

For a population with an established diagnosis of hypertension, and already using health services, these rates indicate a significant problem given all the known complications that are related to hypertension. These results indicate, as the tip of an iceberg, that the problem will likely be worse among those people at the community level, who are aware of their hypertension status but for one reason or another are not using or visiting health services.</p><p>Despite the wide variability of adherence rates reported around the world, the adherence rate (42.6%) found in our study was markedly lower than that encountered in other countries such as Colombia (91%), Canada (77%), China (69.2%), Portugal (48.2%), Brazil (51.4%) and only similar to that reported in South Korea (42.4%) <xref rid="pone.0112875-Shin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Buendia1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Isaza1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Ledur1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This alarmingly poor adherence is also present in other studies in Peru. Carhuallanqui <italic>et al.</italic> reported a 37.9% of adherence in a study conducted in the same general hospital but using a shorter version of the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale questionnaire <xref rid="pone.0112875-Carhuallanqui1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Other local studies described adherence frequencies somewhat higher ranging from 54% to 63% for general hospitals in Trujillo and Lima <xref rid="pone.0112875-AranaMorales1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-DelAguilaDiaz1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Higher adherence levels in these hospitals compared to our findings may be related to differences in the type of health insurance, as these hospitals are part of the social security system and treatment is generally free for their patients.</p><p>In the literature, several factors have been related to adherence. For instance, have found old age to be positively associated to this property. In this regard, a study performed in elderly people in New York City, found a low adherence rate of 34.2% <xref rid="pone.0112875-Shin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Rajpura1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> while factors that increase treatment complexity, such as the administration of several doses per day or the prescription of multiple medications, have been linked to low adherence <xref rid="pone.0112875-Natarajan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In this regard, we only found the use of several medications to be negatively associated with adherence level. Thus, practitioners should pay special attention and deeply explore the beliefs about medication in this particular prone-to-low-adherence group. Moreover, other interventions, such as telephone-based reminders or alarms, might be considered and implemented in this group as complex prescription may be difficult to follow.</p><p>We also found that beliefs about medications play an important role in characterizing adherence patterns. Higher levels in beliefs of drugs' harm and higher concerns about pharmacological hypertensive treatment were related to low adherence after adjustment for confounding factors. On the other hand, beliefs of necessity and overuse did not seem to have an impact on adherence levels. Both, high and low-adherence groups, had high beliefs of necessity and these were the higher scores among all the studied domains while both groups had overuse scores near the cutoff point for high/low overuse beliefs reflecting a neutral position about the excessive prescription of drugs by physicians. However, other studies have linked higher necessity levels and lower concern levels with better adherence levels <xref rid="pone.0112875-Rajpura1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Beliefs of general drugs as harmful agents were more commonly present in the low adherence group who strongly considered that medications are toxic compounds and that these can produce more harm than good. It is understandable that patients who share these ideas would be prone to avoid or skip prescribed medications which highlights the importance of exploring and facing patients' ideas of harm during the encounter as an intervention to increase medication adherence.</p><p>Regarding the disease-specific sections, low adherents had more concerns about their antihypertensive medications compared to high adherents which was also reported in the United States <xref rid="pone.0112875-Ruppar1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. These results only reinforce that all patients' concerns, not only about medication but in general, needs to be addressed by their phisicians and that physician-patient communication is an important and simple tool to increase medication adherence, especially in chronic diseases.</p><p>An interesting finding was that the differential of necessity minus concern about antihypertensive drugs was found to be a strong predictor of high adherence status, in the order of 2.65 times higher. Therefore, beliefs of necessity must outweigh patients' concerns in an individual to highly adhere to a treatment. Practitioners should take into account that low adherence is likely to develop in a patient with high necessity beliefs if their concerns are higher. Once again, this result remarks the importance of addressing patients' concerns about therapy as a promising tool to promote high adherence among patients with hypertension.</p><p>This study expands previous observations by assessing the beliefs and attitudes of patients towards their pharmacological treatment. The instruments used allowed the quantification of qualitative characteristics but also limited the study to the specific domains evaluated by the questionnaire. For instance, aspects such as economic issues that may play a role in medication adherence in patients that cannot afford their prescribed treatment were not considered.</p><p>Despite the differences found, we acknowledge that our study may have been underpowered to find larger differences. The target sample size chosen was decided around duration of the fieldwork data collection period. Still, these differences can inform future work in the area and complement the findings of 37% adherence rates described in a previous publication <xref rid="pone.0112875-Carhuallanqui1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. By selecting the participant population in a hospital setting, the results of this study may overestimate the rate of high adherence as all participants do have a higher degree of awareness of their hypertensive condition compared to the general population.</p><p>Previous population-based studies also in Lima have shown poor awareness and control rates of hypertension <xref rid="pone.0112875-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Lerner1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Another limitation of our design was not having updated blood pressure records at the interview encounter; a decision made to avoid higher blood pressures related to a white-coat effect. This limited the possibility of linking reported adherence to actual control of blood pressure levels as well as their relationship with medication's belief.</p><p>Notoriously, almost all participants rated 4 out of 5 points on the statement that &#x0201c;physicians would prescribe less medication if they spent more time with patients&#x0201d;. To improve current rates of poor adherence, a rational use of medications and a special approach to the patient who is exposed to more than two drugs together with an exploration of necessity and concern about their medications is needed. This interaction would improve the provision of information about drugs' risks and benefits and should clarify all the patient's concerns in a truly shared-decision making process <xref rid="pone.0112875-Stiggelbout1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112875-Bravo1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Daniel Antiporta, Juan Carlos Bazo, Rodrigo Carrillo, Manuel Gutierrez, Fausto Lanao, Maria Lazo and Jos&#x000e9; Alfredo Zavala for their support in several phases of the project and manuscript writing.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0112875-Yusuf1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
