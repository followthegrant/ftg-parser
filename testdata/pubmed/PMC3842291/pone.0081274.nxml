Physical activity questionnaires and activity monitors quantify activity durations or movements, from which estimates of energy expenditure can be made and distinctions between differing lifestyles can be inferred. <xref rid="pone.0081274-Pate1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> Lifestyles are often classified as &#x0201c;sufficiently active&#x0201d; [meet or exceed recommendations for daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA)], &#x0201c;insufficiently active&#x0201d; (below recommendations for daily MVPA). The amount of sedentary time (time spent in very low energy expending activities) within either lifestyle can be quantified as either appropriate or excessive. Strong associations exist between time spent in physical activity <xref rid="pone.0081274-Watz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and sedentary behaviours <xref rid="pone.0081274-Thorp1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and physical and/or psychological health outcomes. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), accelerometry data provide evidence of reduced physical activity levels <xref rid="pone.0081274-Watz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081274-Troosters1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0081274-Pitta2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and disturbed sleep <xref rid="pone.0081274-Klink1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>While activity monitors/sensors can quantify movement and give us estimates of energy expenditure, they are unable to tell us what people are doing. Understanding how people use their time and the time they spend in different kinds of activities or behaviours, is increasingly importantly as evidence indicates that not only are lifestyles linked to health benefits, but the specific activities (i.e. sleep <xref rid="pone.0081274-Cappuccio1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, social interaction <xref rid="pone.0081274-Schwarzer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0081274-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and cognitive activities <xref rid="pone.0081274-Craik1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0081274-Verghese1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>) within those lifestyles are also linked to health benefits independent of the energy expenditure associated with the activity. For example, watching television and reading, two activities difficult to differentiate based on energy expenditure, have differing impacts on eating behaviours and cognitive load as a result influencing health in different ways. Many associations we are aware of are found within the sedentary and/or inactive lifestyles and, as people with COPD have been reported to have reduced activity profiles, <xref rid="pone.0081274-Watz1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081274-Troosters1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0081274-Pitta2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> distinguishing between individual activities is likely to be important. Use of time recalls, unlike physical activity questionnaires or activity monitors, provide researchers with detailed profiles of daily time use. They document every activity a person engages in and obtain important contextual information about specific types and patterns of activities. Despite their use in healthy adolescents <xref rid="pone.0081274-Foley1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and adults <xref rid="pone.0081274-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, these assessments have rarely been used in populations with chronic illnesses. One promising use of time instrument is the Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adults (MARCA), which has had test-retest reliability assessed and has been validated against multiple methods in children, adolescents and healthy adults. <xref rid="pone.0081274-Foley2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0081274-Ridley1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> In each case the MARCA shows high test-retest reliability and good convergent and criterion validity. Significant differences between the time use patterns observed in youth and adulthood and those observed in people with COPD are likely, in part because people with COPD are generally older but also because this population may; not be in full time employment; have less structured days; and may have varying degrees of cognitive impairment.</p><p>This study's aim was to quantify the reliability and validity of the MARCA when compared with objective activity monitoring in people with COPD and their spousal carers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>A convenient sample of people with a clinical diagnosis of COPD and their spousal carers were recruited from Repatriation General Hospitals' (RGH) clinical and research databases.

A fundamental difference between the MARCA and other monitoring methods is its ability to provide estimates of activity not only at a macro level (PAL and MVPA) but also detailed information at a micro level about what types of activities a respondent undertakes. We report excellent test-retest reliability and good convergent validity of the MARCA when compared to the Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer, Sensewear Pro3&#x000ae; armband, and the NL-1000 pedometer. Our data show moderate to strong agreement between the MARCA and both the Actigraph GT3X+ and Sensewear Pro3&#x000ae; (r<sub>s</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.50&#x02013;0.74 for PAL; r<sub>s</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.47&#x02013;0.68 for MVPA) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081274-t004">Table 4</xref>).

</p><p>Criterion validation tools were either cost prohibitive (e.g. doubly labelled water) or considered too intrusive (e.g. video recording) for validity comparisons in this study. We instead measured convergent validity against &#x0201c;measured&#x0201d; counts of activity (Actigraph GT3X+ counts) and &#x0201c;calculated&#x0201d; activity outcomes (PAL and MVPA), based on the MARCA's inbuilt energy expenditure compendium. Using calculated outcomes may be considered a limitation, however as most activity monitoring research report activity in this way due to its immediate intuitiveness; our outcomes also included converted data. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081274-t004">Table 4</xref> shows little difference between validity correlations of &#x0201c;measured&#x0201d; (GT3X+&#x000ae; PAL r<sub>s</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.56&#x02013;0.74) or &#x0201c;calculated&#x0201d; outcomes (SenseWear Pro3&#x000ae; PAL r<sub>s</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.49&#x02013;0.66).</p><p>Understanding how days are constructed is important on multiple levels. Growing evidence confirms that independent of energy expenditure, specific activity domains as well as the context in which they are undertaken influence health outcomes. The physical and psychological benefits of activity vary by domain <xref rid="pone.0081274-Cerin1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081274-Harvey1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and specific types of activity (e.g. cognitively demanding leisure activities <xref rid="pone.0081274-Verghese1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>), their degree of social interactions <xref rid="pone.0081274-Cornwell1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081274-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and their enjoyment levels <xref rid="pone.0081274-Blazer1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081274-Ostir1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>) can affect health in older adults. The MARCA has the potential to provide contextual information that improves our understanding of activity patterns. In turn allowing targeted interventions aimed at modifying behaviour in an attempt to reduce disease burden (i.e. promotion of movement during television commercials during extended bouts of television viewing) to be designed and implemented.</p><p>A six day monitoring protocol was chosen as differences in the types of activities undertaken on weekend and week days within a week are likely to occur. Activity monitoring data was only used to validate the four days of activity recall and in order to facilitate mutually agreeable MARCA interview times, two additional days of monitoring were included. Participants were asked to include at least one weekend and one week day during their activity recall periods. By assessing reliability in this way, it was evident that people with COPD and their carers were able to adequately recall activities undertaken during the preceding two days, and where present, the recall biases were small (&#x0003c; 15 min). Because diurnal variations in time use (across and within time use domains) and dose-response relationships (between domains of time use and health outcomes) have as yet, not been quantified in people with COPD, the clinical significance of the observed biases is unknown. We believe it is extremely unlikely these biases to be of significance due to their relatively small sizes.</p><p>Assessment using a dyad (COPD and carer) was novel. It allowed for validity to be assessed on two similarly aged (COPD 74.4&#x000b1;7.9; Carer 69.6&#x000b1;10.9), cohabitating members of a dyad each with distinct levels of capacity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081274-g001">Figure 1</xref>, shows the 24-hour activity pattern of one enrolled dyad. Despite similar macro level movement patterns (accelerometry counts), there were significant differences in the types of activities undertaken at the micro level of time between the two dyad members. Additional analyses are planned for this and other similar use of time data to better understand activity patterns in people with chronic health conditions but were omitted from this manuscript as it's focus is assessing the MARCA's reliability and validity.</p><p>MARCA interviews were very well tolerated. Only one research dyad failed to provide complete MARCA interview data in our study. The majority of participants enjoyed being interviewed. The MARCA analytical software and &#x0201c;one-click&#x0201d; analysis mean the MARCA has low researcher burden.</p><p>Unlike standard physical activity questionnaires, the MARCA, does not collect answers to broad statements (e.g. &#x0201c;How many minutes did you spend walking yesterday?&#x0201d;) but rather reconstructs entire days. As a previous day physical activity recall, the MARCA relies on respondents being able to recall detailed accounts of a given day. Two separate days are unlikely to be constructed identically and recall precision will deteriorate with time. Assessments of the test-retest reliability of previous day activity recalls are as a result required to be undertaken on the same calendar day <xref rid="pone.0081274-Helmerhorst1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>This study was not without limitations. Firstly a relatively small sample size was used that was biased towards participants with severe COPD. Nearly fifty percent of enrolled participants with COPD had a diagnosis of severe COPD according to GOLD guidelines. <xref rid="pone.0081274-Rabe1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> As the aim of this study was to confirm the reliability and validity of the MARCA in people with COPD we did not include functional limitation measures (i.e. six minute walk tests or Medical Research Council scales for respiratory related impairment) which means we are unable to provide comment on how well our research sample represents broader groups of people with COPD with differing levels of functional limitations. We also infer the observed activity profiles are due to COPD, however many within aged populations have chronic comorbid conditions that independently modify time use. Multiple self-reported comorbidities were common in our participants, with cardiovascular disease and musculoskeletal conditions being the most common. Spirometric assessment revealed twenty percent (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5) of carers met GOLD criteria for a COPD diagnosis despite not identifying themselves as a person who had COPD. When participants were allocated to either a COPD or non-COPD group based on spirometric criteria, there was little change in the reliability (ICC&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.53&#x02013;1.00) and validity correlations (r<sub>s</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.26&#x02013;0.77).</p><p>Potential misreporting of activity by participants may have also occurred due to; unnoticed movements, inaccurate recall or perceived social expectations. The inclusion of objective monitoring devices was designed to assess this potential limitation, with validity correlations between the devices showing bias of this nature unlikely. Comparisons of validity required correct device wear. Participants were instructed on the use of each device, and were provided with instructions for each device. In addition participants were asked to keep a non-wear diary. Device wear was estimated using SenseWear Pro3&#x000ae; data (assuming all devices were worn simultaneously), by extracting self report non-wear and by applying algorithms designed to identify bouts of consecutive zero counts lasting more than 90 minutes in accelerometry files. Using these approaches, activity recall periods had between 97% and 99% coverage with activity monitoring devices, Simultaneous device wear was assumed and Sensewear Pro3&#x000ae; data was used to determine non-wear. Validity results remained strong even when these non-wear periods were removed from analyses.</p><p>One further consideration is that consistent with most recall instruments improved reliability and validity outcomes were observed in our sample than in previous adolescent reports. Despite initial development in adolescents, each of the current activity libraries contain both universal and specific age related activities. However, the majority of energy expenditure values have been derived from the younger adult population. The modest differences in reliability/validity analyses between our sample and previous studies in adolescence may simply be a function of the different age specific nature of activities.</p><p>MARCA derived estimates of MVPA (98+/&#x02212;66 mins) were significantly (p&#x0003c;0.0001) higher than Actigraph GT3X+&#x000ae; (47+/&#x02212;46 mins) or Sensewear Pro3&#x000ae; estimates (71+/&#x02212;55 mins). These observations were in part likely due to differences in how the MARCA captures use of time data. People recall individual activities, associated durations and report the activities average intensity (e.g. playing moderate intensity tennis for an hour), while activity monitors report actual movement. In an hour's tennis, for example, where the average intensity exceeds the MVPA threshold, there may be many inactive periods. It is also possible that the current energy expenditure compendium, based largely on data from young adults, does not accurately capture the true energy costs experienced by people with COPD or their carers. This may also be the reason behind the observed differences between MARCA derived PAL (1.40+/&#x02212;0.17) and PAL values obtained from the SenseWear Pro3&#x000ae; (1.33+/&#x02212;0.26). Older people (with or without COPD) may expend greater energy performing similar tasks due to decreased mobility, dyspnoea or underlying chronic disease processes, resulting in a greater perceived effort. Alternatively, activities may be undertaken more slowly with lower energy expenditure, resulting in inconsistencies between the MARCA calculated and accelerometer recorded energy costs.</p><p>People with COPD had marginally weaker correlations compared to their nominated carer. Secondary analysis undertaken after grouping participants according to whether or not they met spirometric diagnosis of COPD, also found marginally weaker correlations in people with spirometric confirmed COPD. Decreased cognitive ability and potentially greater variance between individual daily routines within COPD populations may account for these observations. Despite this, similar patterns of activity were observed in both groups, with the only minor difference being within the superdomain &#x0201c;chores&#x0201d;, where carers spent a greater proportion of time. Whether this was resultant from a reduced capacity experienced by those with COPD or because of historic divisions of domestic labor according to gender is unknown.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Implications</title><p>Activity promotion is a primary management strategy for people with COPD. <xref rid="pone.0081274-Ostir1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> The MARCA permits recording of individual and potentially group use of time profiles, allowing identification of periods where potentially detrimental health behaviours regularly occur, raising the possibility of designing specific behavioural strategies.
