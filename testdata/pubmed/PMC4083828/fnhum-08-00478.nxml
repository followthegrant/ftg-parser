In order to better elucidate the beauty of paintings, it seems necessary to compare aesthetic appreciation of paintings and photographic analogs which included corresponding real images. We prepared for famous painters&#x02019; pictures and their photographic analogs which were set up to resemble each painting in order to investigate the hypothesis that there exist specific neural correlates associated with the aesthetic appreciation for paintings. Forty-four subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance study which required comparisons of aesthetic appreciation of paintings of still life and landscape versus photographic analogs including corresponding real images of still life and landscape.

In conclusion, the present findings suggest a possibility of the existence of specific neural correlates associated with the aesthetic appreciation for paintings and that bilateral cuneus and the left lingual gyrus may be involved.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)</kwd><kwd>appreciation</kwd><kwd>beauty</kwd><kwd>oil painting</kwd><kwd>lingual gyrus</kwd><kwd>cuneus</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="13"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="4086"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuroaesthetics is a relatively young field within cognitive neuroscience, concerned with the neural underpinnings of aesthetic experience of beauty, particularly in visual art. Neuroscientific investigations have approached this area using imaging and neurophysiological techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), but the results produced so far are very heterogeneous (Cinzia and Vittorio, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Brown et al. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) meta-analyzed 93 neuroimaging studies of aesthetic appraisal across four sensory modalities and showed that the most concordant area of activation across all four modalities is the right anterior insula, which reflects the &#x0201c;viscerality&#x0201d; of aesthetic perception. Although this meta-analysis revealed the activation of the right anterior insula, regarding the aesthetic appreciation of oil paintings, so far, the activation of the orbitofrontal cortex has been reported (Kirk, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kirk et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009a</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Ishizu and Zeki, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Also, the activation of lingual gyrus has been shown (Kawabata and Zeki, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Vartanian and Goel, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) while that of occipital gyri has been reported (Vartanian and Goel, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Cupchik et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>Such heterogeneity may be attributed to previous studies&#x02019; measurement of aesthetic appreciation of not only the beauty of paintings but also the beauty of motifs of the paintings, which is inevitably contained in the case of representational paintings. To elucidate the neural substrates involved in perceiving the beauty of representational paintings, it seems necessary to compare the beauty of the paintings of still life and landscape and that of real images (photographic analogs) which contain the same motifs as the paintings. Because the representational paintings with still life and landscape as their motifs can be reproduced faithfully as photographs by using the real materials or scenes, and hence both can evoke the same aesthetic feeling attributable to the beauty of motifs. Thus, contrasting these two conditions is expected to reveal the neural correlates specifically associated with the beauty of paintings with controlling the beauty of the motifs. To the best of our knowledge, Lacey et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) firstly compared paintings and photographic analogs where famous painters&#x02019; pictures and roughly resembling photographic analogs were used. In a different way, Vartanian and Goel (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) have filtered each original painting to make a control condition such that the filtered pictures retained the overall form of the original paintings but lacked perceptual details, showing that the comparison of original paintings versus filtered paintings activated the right fusiform gyrus.</p><p>Hence, in the present study, we prepared for famous painters&#x02019; pictures and their photographic analogs which were set up to resemble each painting in order to investigate the hypothesis that there exist specific neural correlates associated with the aesthetic appreciation for paintings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Forty-four healthy subjects participated in the experiment but 5 subjects revealed artifacts. Therefore, 39 subjects&#x02019; data (mean age = 27.5 &#x000b1; 5.7, 17 female) were submitted to analysis. Twenty-nine subjects were not interested in painting by themselves whereas the other 10 subjects were interested. The mean frequency of visiting museum was 0.76 times per year in the 29 subjects and 2.0 in the 10 subjects, respectively.

They gave written informed consent to participate in this study according to procedures approved by the ethical committee at Oita University Faculty of Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stimuli</title><p>Several days before imaging experiment, each subject slowly and carefully viewed 20 paintings of which contents were still life and land scape by famous painters such as Cezanne, Monet and so on. The 20 paintings were displayed on the table and ranked subjectively. Consequently, they were divided into 3 groups consisting of 5 paintings of the most beautiful, 10 paintings of more beautiful, and 5 paintings of not so beautiful by each subject. Thereafter, 5 paintings of the 10 paintings of more beautiful were randomly selected by the researcher (Y.M.). In sum, 15 paintings (5 of the most beautiful, 5 of more beautiful, and 5 of not so beautiful) were used for the following imaging experiment. Twenty photographs were taken in advance by the researcher (Y.M.) to imitate the 20 paintings as similarly as possible. Every effort was made to prepare similar motifs to imitate the corresponding paintings. Independently, the 20 photographic analogs were displayed on the table and ranked subjectively. These photographs (i.e., photographic analogs) were used as a control for the imaging experiment as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Since artistic paintings could not be used, the set of photographs of artistic paintings were used as Cela-Conde et al. (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). It should be noted that the content of paintings and photographs were not the same across subjects and depended on individual subject&#x02019;s aesthetic appreciation of the paintings. Moreover, there was no significant difference in luminance between paintings and photographs.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Example of painting and photographic analogs stimuli in this study.

In comparison with the pre-experimental appreciation, 83.6% of (pre-appreciated) the most beautiful paintings were appreciated as beautiful. Similarly, 64.1% of more beautiful paintings and 33.3% of not so beautiful paintings were appreciated as beautiful. Regarding photographic analogs, 68.9% of photographic analogs to the most beautiful paintings, 59.7% of photographic analogs to more beautiful paintings, and 39.7% of photographic analogs to not so beautiful paintings were appreciated as beautiful. There was no significant difference in the number of appreciation of beautiful between all paintings and all photographic analogs (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 1.86, <italic>p</italic> = 0.40). During the experiment appreciation, subjects appreciated the painting as beautiful (58.7%) and they appreciated the photographic analogs as beautiful (57.5%) with no significant difference. Nonetheless, the association between the pre-experimental appreciation and the experimental appreciation was significantly positive for both paintings and photographic analogs in all 39 subjects. Therefore, it seems likely that there was a substantially difference in the aesthetic impact (paintings &#x0003e; photographic analogs), but the way of question (beautiful or not in the experiment) could not draw the difference. In order to investigate this possibility, we compared the rankings of the most beautiful paintings and those of their corresponding photographic analogs. In the ranking method, &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; is the most beautiful and a lower ranking value means more beautiful. As a result, the mean of the rankings of the most beautiful paintings was 3.0 (SD = 1.4) and that of those of their corresponding photographic analogs was 6.9 (SD = 5.1) (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;11.8, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

On the other hand, perceived beauty of photographic analogs may consist of the beauty of the motifs of the corresponding paintings plus the beauty of the photographs themselves. The present study could not measure each part, but perceived beauty of the paintings minus perceived beauty of the photographic analogs could have cancelled the beauty of the motifs and thereby estimated the beauty of the paintings themselves although the motifs of the photographic analogs were not completely the same as those of the paintings. In any case, the rate of beautiful appreciation was clearly decreased in line with the decrease of pre-appreciated beauty, indicating the validity of the present method to assess the appreciation of beauty of paintings.</p><p>Although during the experiment appreciation subjects appreciated the painting as beautiful (58.7%) and they appreciated the photographic analogs as beautiful (57.5%) with no significant difference, it seems likely that there was a substantially difference in the aesthetic impact (paintings &#x0003e; photographic analogs), but the way of question (beautiful or not in the experiment) could not draw the difference. In order to investigate this possibility, we compared the rankings of the most beautiful paintings and those of their corresponding photographic analogs. As a result, the mean of the rankings of the most beautiful paintings was 3.0 (SD = 1.4) and that of those of their corresponding photographic analogs was 6.9 (SD = 5.1) (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;11.8, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Therefore, there was a significant difference in the aesthetic impact (paintings &#x0003e; photographic analogs) in the pre-experimental setting. Taking the significantly positive association between the pre-experimental appreciation and the experimental appreciation, it seems likely that there was a significant difference in the aesthetic impact (paintings &#x0003e; photographic analogs) in the experimental setting.</p><p>Again, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that there exist specific neural correlates associated with the aesthetic appreciation for paintings. Therefore, we focused the comparison of aesthetic appreciation of paintings versus photographic analogs as a control. With regard to the comparison of aesthetic appreciation of 15 paintings versus 15 photographic analogs, bilateral cuneus and the left lingual gyrus were activated. These findings suggest that there exist specific neural correlates associated with the aesthetic appreciation for paintings and that they may be associated with bilateral cuneus and the left lingual gyrus.</p><p>Kawabata and Zeki (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) showed that during aesthetical appreciation, paintings of landscapes produced activation in the anterior part of lingual gyrus, which is at least partly in accordance with our findings which revealed activation in the left lingual gyrus. Cupchik et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) revealed that the comparison of aesthetic appreciation (viewing representational paintings with aesthetic appreciation) versus baseline (viewing non-representational paintings without aesthetic or pragmatic appreciation) activated the bilateral insula (BA13) and bilateral occipital gyri (BA18/19) while the comparison of pragmatic appreciation versus baseline activated the right fusiform gyrus and bilateral occipital gyri (BA19) which is at least partly in accordance with our findings which revealed activation in bilateral cuneus (BA18) and the left lingual gyrus (BA18). Taken together, these studies suggest that bilateral cuneus and the left lingual gyrus may be neural correlates closely associated with aesthetic appreciation of paintings, which support our findings. With regard to the function of lingual gyrus, Chatterjee et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) argued that activation in this region represents its sensitivity to beauty, which is in line with the present findings.</p><p>Huang et al. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) proposed that the activation of brain networks including frontopolar cortex and right precuneus rather than a single cortical area in their paradigm supports the art scholar&#x02019;s view that esthetic judgments are multi-faceted and multi-dimensional in nature. The present findings also suggest that in our paradigm perceived beauty of the artistic paintings may be associated with the brain network which may include various regions including bilateral cingulate gyrus and bilateral medial frontal gyrus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and specifically bilateral cuneus and left lingual gyrus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) were activated.</p><p>One limitation is that the motifs were limited to still life and landscape of French late 19th century painters and excluded abstract paintings. Another limitation is methodological which contains a small number of blocks and order effects where paintings are always presented first. Moreover, it is unknown whether the block design is the best method. Also, aesthetic impact is not a unitary factor, being generated by fear, disgust, alarm as much as beauty or tranquility and these factors should have been considered as covariates in the analysis of our paradigm. Finally, the activation in what is termed the cuneus and lingual gyrus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) corresponds to the foveal representation of the early visual areas, and may be interpreted as the expected fine-grain difference between the textural quality of the paintings versus the photographs. This textural difference cannot be completely differentiated from aesthetic. Further studied are required to generalize the present findings.</p><p>In conclusion, the present findings suggest a possibility that bilateral cuneus and the left lingual gyrus may be also closely associated with aesthetic appreciation of representational paintings.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn0001"><p><sup>1</sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>X.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tisdelle</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Eickhoff</surname><given-names>S.
