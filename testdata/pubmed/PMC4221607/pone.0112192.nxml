NPCs are fabricated with nanometer precision through layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of a multilayered shell <xref rid="pone.0112192-Decher1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The process is based on the alternate adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes onto a sacrificial nano-/micro-particle core <xref rid="pone.0112192-Sukhorukov2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112192-Sukhorukov3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Once the multilayered shell is assembled, the core is dissolved by a complexing agent or in an acidic medium. The main advantages of this technique are its simplicity and versatility, since only very simple apparatus is required for NPC assembly with the ability to synthesize NPCs of different sizes and shapes dependent upon the building blocks. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that several functionalities in a particular NPC can be achieved by inclusion of different functional molecules, biomolecules, polymers and inorganic nanoparticles, both in the shell and in its hollow void <xref rid="pone.0112192-Sukhorukov4" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Finally, various stimuli-responsive NPCs have been developed, which are able to vary the permeability of their shell for encapsulation and release after a specific stimulus such as pH, laser irradiation, ultrasound, magnetic fields and enzymatic digestion <xref rid="pone.0112192-Antipov1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112192-Pastorino3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In this context, the inclusion of active functional proteins in nano-/micro-sized systems is of particular interest in the biomedical field. Such functional systems can be applied in biocatalysis to perform specific reactions in restricted volumes, in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, monitoring <italic>in vivo</italic> parameters and releasing cargo molecules under specific conditions, and in functional studies of important classes of proteins <xref rid="pone.0112192-Anandhakumar1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112192-Lvov1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Membrane proteins are one of the most important classes of proteins since they mediate the interaction between the biotic cellular environment and the abiotic external medium. They are responsible for various biological processes, such as cell signaling-transduction pathways and bioenergetics. Therefore, membrane proteins are of great importance for research and healthcare applications.</p><p>Herein the functionalization of NPC shells by a membrane protein, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase is described. Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (Cyt<italic>c</italic>O) is the terminal enzyme in the respiratory chain and is located in the inner mitochondrial or bacterial membrane. Cyt<italic>c</italic>O catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to water through electrons delivered by cytochrome <italic>c</italic>. The reaction is linked to the pumping of one proton across the membrane for each electron transferred from its substrate cytochrome <italic>c</italic> to O<sub>2</sub>, although this ratio is reduced in certain types of Cyt<italic>c</italic>O. The resulting proton gradient activates ATP synthase to generate ATP from ADP. This chemical process represents one of the most critical aspects of cellular respiration. The reconstitution of energy transducing proteins, such as cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, into biomimetic membranes has been proposed for the fabrication of active materials with broad applicability <xref rid="pone.0112192-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112192-Erokhina1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. To our knowledge, only one paper deals with the functionalization of polyelectrolyte multilayers with a membrane protein, namely bacteriorhodopsin <xref rid="pone.0112192-Erokhina1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>In our work, Cyt<italic>c</italic>O, specifically the <italic>ba</italic>

Four bilayers were deposited onto the surface of the particles; after each deposition step, the dispersion of covered particles was centrifuged (2500 rpm for 5 min) and the precipitated covered particles were separated from the solution.

It was previously demonstrated by Ladam and co-workers <xref rid="pone.0112192-Ladam1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> that proteins strongly interact with polyelectrolyte films whatever the sign of the charge of both the multilayer and the protein. When the charges of the multilayer and the protein are similar, one usually observes the formation of dense protein monolayers. It was demonstrated also that, when the protein and the multilayer become oppositely charged, the adsorbed amounts of protein are usually larger, leading to the formation of protein layers extending up to several times the largest dimension of the protein <xref rid="pone.0112192-Ladam1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In our work, the 2D LbL assembly of the multilayered shell was first characterized step-by-step by QCM. Specifically, synthetic anionic PSS and cationic PAH were used for the formation of the multilayer. (PSS/PAH)-NPCs were chosen as the most studied LbL NPCs system, which is fully characterized in terms of stability and permeability. Firstly, the interaction of Cyt<italic>c</italic>O with multilayers possessing a negative or positive terminal layer was investigated by the QCM working in air. For both multilayers, the frequency shift due to the deposition of each successive layer of polyelectrolyte onto the quartz crystal showed a gradual growth of the multilayer as a function of the assembly cycles. Comparing the results obtained for the two structures, the multilayer with a positive PAH terminal layer was found to be the better one as relates to Cyt<italic>c</italic>O molecules surface density. Specifically, the estimated surface densities for Cyt<italic>c</italic>O molecules were found to be 273&#x000b1;11 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> and 129&#x000b1;5 ng/cm<sup>2</sup> for positive and negative terminal layers respectively. This can be explained considering that the isoelectric point (pI) of <italic>ba</italic>
<sub>3</sub>-oxidase is 7.3, and at the working pH of 8.5 the total surface charge of <italic>ba</italic>
<sub>3</sub>-oxidase molecules is mainly negative, resulting in a stronger interaction with PAH terminated multilayer.</p><p>The assembly of the multilayer PAH-(PSS/PAH)<sub>4</sub>/Cyt<italic>c</italic>O at pH 8.5 was further characterized in real-time and in liquid environment by QCM-D. The <italic>in-situ</italic> QCM-D analysis of the formation of multilayers provides the total mass, polymer and water, adsorbed onto the quartz crystal surface at each deposition step. Highly hydrated multilayers tend to behave as soft viscoelastic hydrogels rather than rigid films. The loss of rigidity is detected by QCM-D. For rigid films, the frequency changes upon increasing film mass are the same for all overtones. For viscoelastic gels, &#x00394;f versus time curves for different overtones do not superimpose. This feature is apparent in kinetic QCM-D traces recorded during the buildup of PAH-(PSS/PAH)<sub>4</sub>/Cyt<italic>c</italic>O multilayers after the third deposited layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0112192-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0112192-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0112192.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>QCM-D result showing the in situ build-up of the multilayer PAH-(PSS/PAH)<sub>4</sub>/Cyt<italic>c</italic>O films at a pH 8.5.</title><p>Frequency changes are recorded as a function of time for the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> armonics.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0112192.g001"/></fig><p>For this reason, the data were analyzed using the Voigt-based model.

The micro-particles were then dissolved by complexation with EDTA to obtain hollow NPCs. The dissolution process was followed through optical microscopy. The obtained NPCs were then functionalized with Cyt<italic>c</italic>O.</p><p>The surface charge of functionalized and plain (PSS/PAH)<sub>4</sub> NPCs was followed by microelectrophoresis. At the assembly pH 8.5 the surface potential of plain (PSS/PAH)<sub>4</sub> NPCs was found to be +12 mV. Cyt<italic>c</italic>O was then adsorbed and the surface potential decreased to -2 mV, indicating that the deposition of Cyt<italic>c</italic>O was successful. The surface potential was also checked at the activity test pH 7.4, which is very close to the pI of ba3 Cyt<italic>c</italic>O (7.3). This characterization was carried out in order to verify that under activity test conditions Cyt<italic>c</italic>O molecules where still adsorbed onto the NPCs surface. At pH 7.4, the surface potential of plain (PSS/PAH)<sub>4</sub> NPCs was found to be increased to +28 mV. This increase can be explained taking into account that the pI of PAH is 9. In the case of Cyt<italic>c</italic>O functionalized (PSS/PAH)<sub>4</sub> NPCs, the surface potential decresead to +8 mV. The difference between the surface potentials of the two samples indicates that Cyt<italic>c</italic>O molecules are still adsorbed onto the surface of the NPCs. This behaviour at a pH close to the pI of LbL assembled proteins has been already reported in the literature. The LbL self-assembly process is primarily govened by electrostatic interactions.

The cationic chitosan and anionic pectin were used for this. Specifically, we used a form of pectin with a high degree of methylation (70&#x02013;75%), which is inversely proportional to the pectin charge density. Charge density plays a pivotal role in determining the stability of the multilayer <xref rid="pone.0112192-Schoeler1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The formation of stable films is not possible below a minimum charge density. Therefore, we can postulate that in the chitosan/pectin multilayer, there is an excess of positive charge and thus multilayer results in a more unstable and loose structure. Taking into consideration that the p<italic>K</italic>

It was observed that after Cyt<italic>c</italic>O functionalization and related washing steps, the majority of the capsules were destroyed or deformed.

On the bases of these observations, it can be hypothesized that Cyt<italic>c</italic>O molecules strongly interact with the multilayer and that different interaction types are involved, such as hydrophobic ones This inteaction leads to the formation of defects, which determine an increased permeability, for strongly bound multilayers (PSS/PAH), and to a loose and instable structure for weakly bound multilayers (chitosan/pectin).</p><fig id="pone-0112192-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0112192.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>(CHI/PEC)<sub>4</sub>/Cyt<italic>c</italic>O NPCs sequence of images before (Panel A) and after addition of dye (B&#x02013;D).</title><p>The dashed line indicates the border of one (CHI/PEC)<sub>4</sub>/Cyt<italic>c</italic>O NPCs which upon addition of the dye swells and finally explodes.

The immobilized enzyme remained active with respect to the catalysis of O<sub>2</sub> reduction to H<sub>2</sub>O. Finally, it was observed that the permeability properties of the NPCs, having different composition, are strongly affected from the interaction with Cyt<italic>c</italic>O molecules. The results demonstrate that the NPC permeability is affected by the presence of membrane-integral enzymes depending on its composition. Therefore, the interaction of NPCs with Cy<italic>c</italic>O can be regarded as an <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization of <italic>in vivo</italic> properties of such systems. Considering the flexibility of the LbL method, a range of membrane proteins can indeed be incorporated into the capsule structure. In the present work, Cyt<italic>c</italic>O was chosen as a proof-of-concept, extendable to other proteins. Functional nanostructured colloidal systems are highly interesting both for the functional studies of energy transducing proteins, such Cyt<italic>c</italic>O, and for other biological-based applications including cellular compartment-targeted drug delivery, biosensing and biofuel cells.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0112192-DeGeest1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
