However, the detailed 3D chromatin folding structures have not been fully visualized due to the lack of robust and ultra-resolution imaging capability. Here, we report the development of an electron microscopy method that combines serial block-face scanning electron microscopy with in situ hybridization (3D-EMISH) to visualize 3D chromatin folding at targeted genomic regions with ultra-resolution (5 &#x000d7; 5 &#x000d7; 30&#x02009;nm in xyz dimensions) that is superior to the current super-resolution by fluorescence light microscopy. We apply 3D-EMISH to human lymphoblastoid cells at a 1.7&#x02009;Mb segment of the genome and visualize a large number of distinctive 3D chromatin folding structures in ultra-resolution.

Indeed, specific three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromosomal folding has been shown to have a profound impact on genome functions, such as gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and DNA replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. To investigate the detailed structures of 3D genome organization, two general approaches have been developed and applied&#x02014;sequencing-based mapping and microscopy-based imaging. Mainstream 3D genome mapping methods such as Hi-C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and ChIA-PET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> detect pairwise long-range chromatin interactions by chromatin proximity ligation followed by high-throughput sequencing and mapping to the reference genome, thus inferring long-range chromatin contacts and rendering the 3D configuration of the genome. However, 3D genome mapping data are derived from millions of cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and provided an average view of genome folding. Specifically, the techniques revealed smaller subunits of chromosome territories&#x02014;topologically associated domains (TADs by Hi-C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and chromatin contact domains (CCDs by ChIA-PET)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, demarcated by multiple binding sites for CTCF protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, even though the contact probabilities are clearly displayed, the mapping data lack physical scale (e.g., in micrometers and nanometers). To overcome these limitations, microscopy can be used to visualize the actual genome architecture and metric scale in various spatiotemporal resolutions in individual nuclei with different DNA staining methods. Standard fluorescence light microscopy has an optical resolution of about 250&#x02009;nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and has been applied to image mammalian nuclei, successfully establishing the concept of chromosome territory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> showing chromosomal morphologies in different cell cycle phases, and is also routinely used in cytogenetics to study abnormal chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Recently, a super-resolution fluorescence light microscopy (20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20&#x02009;nm in <italic>xy</italic> dimensions, 50&#x02009;nm in <italic>z</italic> dimension) with sequence-specific DNA-binding probes was applied to visualize specific chromatin folding structures for a 10&#x02013;500&#x02009;Kb and 3&#x02009;Mb target genomic region in Drosophila cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and 1.2&#x02013;2.5&#x02009;Mb target genomic region in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, this method has a limit in <italic>z</italic>-dimension image depth (up to 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;m)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and thus larger 3D chromatin structures beyond this limit would be truncated or lost. Electron microscopic in situ hybridization (EMISH) using biotin-labeled DNA probes coupled with diaminobenzidine staining has been used to image chromosomal DNA in the nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. When standard FISH protocols are used in electron microscopy (EM) study, severe artefacts have been attributed to formamide and high-temperature treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, volume (3D) EM approaches&#x02014;serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> were used with success in studies of global architecture of cell nuclei. SBF-SEM can reach a resolution ~5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;5&#x02009;nm in <italic>xy</italic>, while resolution in <italic>z</italic> depends on a thickness of cut ultrathin slices, and FIB-SEM achieves a resolution down to ~3&#x02009;nm in all dimensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The most recent effort in using EM for imaging chromatin structure is EM tomography with even higher resolution (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1&#x02009;nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, in which photo-oxidized label is used to mark all DNA and to visualize the overall chromatin structures for 3D imaging in the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, but within a limited depth at <italic>z</italic>-axis (250&#x02009;nm). Nonetheless, our ability to visualize 3D chromatin-folding structures in high-quality ultra-resolution remains inadequate, hampered in particular by the lack of sequence specificity, and low depth of imaging in the <italic>z</italic> dimension.</p><p id="Par4">In our efforts to achieve ultra-resolution visualization of sequence-specific 3D chromatin folding structures, we present 3D electron microscopic in situ hybridization (3D-EMISH) method that combines advanced in situ hybridization using biotinylated DNA probes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> with silver staining and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The serial <italic>z</italic>-stack EM images is assembled computationally into a 3D conformation of the targeted genomic region with a resolution of 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;5&#x02009;nm in the <italic>xy</italic> plane and 30&#x02009;nm in the <italic>z</italic>-axis. We apply 3D-EMISH to visualize a specific chromatin folding location in the human genome, and analyze more than 200 distinctive 3D chromatin structures derived from individual nuclei of human lymphoblastoid cells.

The embedded clots (&#x0003c;5&#x02009;mm in size) were cut into 40-&#x000b5;m-thick sections in the freezing microtome. The next step in 3D-EMISH is in situ hybridization (ISH). The free-floating 40-&#x000b5;m-thick sections were incubated with the biotinylated DNA probes targeting a specific genomic region of interest. The signals of the biotinylated DNA probes for EM detection were processed with the use of 1.4-nm-thick streptavidin-conjugated fluoronanogold particles and subsequent silver enhancement. The procedure of silver enhancement was experimentally optimized to obtain electron dense 4&#x02013;5-nm diameter granules as the smallest items (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1a&#x02013;c</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">To optimize chromatin ultrastructure preservation, we performed a set of in situ hybridization (ISH) tests. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we assessed in details the influence of potentially harmful factors associated within the ISH procedure (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Comparing with the control of no ISH procedure (nucleus in native state) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1d</xref>), the ISH procedure including permeabilization by Triton X-100 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1e</xref>) or treatment with formamide and high temperature (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1f</xref>) showed at most moderate changes or deteriorations in chromatin structure. However, surprisingly, we found that the inclusion of dextran sulfate, commonly used in ISH to increase the probe concentration and the hybridization reaction speed, caused the most distortion to the chromatin ultrastructure (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1g</xref>), matched with prior experimental observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, dextran sulphate was omitted from ISH in our 3D-EMISH protocol. We observed that the lack of dextran sulphate in ISH had only a minor impact on hybridization efficiency and slightly increased background (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1h&#x02013;i</xref>). To ascertain our observation on dextran sulphate, we performed a specific DNA staining with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) according to M. Thiry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This method utilizes TdT to add labeled nucleotides to the free DNA ends, formed by ultrathin cutting, that are subsequently detected by immunogold staining. We again observed here that permeabilization with Triton X-100 had caused at most moderate changes or deteriorations in chromatin structure and DNA distribution. The TdT experiments showed further that extensive filamentous objects were observed with the addition of dextran sulfate. Some particles were also found in the cytoplasm, what might suggest the loss of nuclear membrane integrity (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">After in situ hybridization, the 40-&#x000b5;m-thick sections were stained with uranyl acetate and tannic acid, followed by dehydrating and flat-embedding in an epoxy resin. Because uranyl acetate stains nucleic acids and proteins broadly, its inclusion in 3D-EMISH enabled us to visualize the overall nuclear space in relation to the target chromatin structure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). One block of the embedded specimens (usually less than 1&#x02009;mm in width) was placed in the chamber of SBF-SEM (details in &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d;, Zeiss Sigma VP) equipped with a built-in ultramicrotome (Gatan 3View)<italic>.</italic> The specimen block was consecutively sliced one layer at a time at 30&#x02013;50-nm intervals, and the exposed surfaces of the specimen was serially scanned in a field of 8192&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;8192 pixels (~1700&#x02009;&#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>, when a pixel size is 5&#x02009;nm) to obtain the volumetric data, including the specific 3D-EMISH signals. The specimen was sliced again for the next round of signal acquisition and so forth. This cycling process of slicing&#x02013;scanning was performed hundreds of times to generate <italic>z</italic>-stack images in a 3D-EMISH experiment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Since all in situ hybridization reactions result in nonspecific background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, the 3D-EMISH signals in each slice also included punctate patterns of staining that we deemed likely to be noise (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We reason that the specific signals from the targeted chromatin would be in continuation in multiple layers of the <italic>z</italic>-stack images, whereas the nonspecific signals would not be connected in the <italic>z</italic>-stacks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Therefore, we developed an image-processing algorithm based on multilayer connectivity to retain true chromatin-positive signals and remove false-positive one. The volume ratio of the specific vs. nonspecific signal, in the analyzed regions of interest, was estimated as 0.78 (&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.40 STD,&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.12 SEM), the nonspecific signal occupied 1.88% (&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.46% STD,&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.15% SEM) of the total background volume (&#x000b1;&#x02009;STD, 10 different ROIs). Examples of the images before and after background filtering are presented in the Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>. After filtering out the background noise, the chromatin signals were assembled to reconstruct the 3D chromatin-folding structure in ultra-resolution for the targeted genomic region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Chromatin-folding structures captured by 3D-EMISH</title><p id="Par10">We applied 3D-EMISH to investigate chromatin-folding structures in the genome of the human lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878.

To confirm the presence of the chromatin loop domains inferred by these sequencing-based approaches, we designed and produced biotinylated DNA probes derived from 11 BAC clones to cover this region for 3D-EMISH experiments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). To test the hybridization efficiency of the probes to the target genomic region, we also generated two-color fluorescence probes from the BAC clones that could help distinguish the three domains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Subsequently, we performed 3D FISH imaging analysis using confocal microscopy, and validated that these probes were efficient and highly specific (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>3D-EMISH chromatin image collection for 1.7&#x02009;Mb target genomic region.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Genome browser view of the target region in hg38, Chr7:141,547,153&#x02013;143,237,066, in GM12878 cells.

At first glance, it appeared that the chromatin folding structures at this region in GM12878 cells varied from having a single domain to multiple sub-domains. To further quantitatively analyze the structural features, we developed a computational algorithm to characterize potential chromatin-folding properties. First, we aligned each of the reconstructed 3D chromatin structures along with its principal axes, by orthogonalization of the structure inertia tensor. This representation allows clear dissection of the chromatin signals in more detailed folding structures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Next, we calculated the local density centers in each chromatin structure, followed by diffusing the density from the centers to demarcate the boundaries and to identify distinctive domains in the 3D-EMISH structures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). For example, in the three different 3D-EMISH structures (sID50, sID12, and sID42), one, two, and three local density centers were identified, respectively, corresponding to morphological domains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>; Supplementary Movies&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">6</xref>).

The signal ratio was calculated as follows: For each of these 3D EM stacks, we created the following binary masks: specific signal mask (SP), nonspecific background signal mask (NS), and no-signal background mask (BN). The specific and nonspecific signal volume were obtained by summing all mask elements for SP and NS masks, respectively, and multiplying them by the voxel volume, by which we obtain specific-to-nonspecific signal ratio. The content of the nonspecific signal in the background volume was obtained by dividing NS mask volume by the total background volume (sum of NS and BN mask volumes)</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data collection and 3D visualizations</title><p id="Par37">For the data collection, we used Fiji distribution of ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads#Life-Line_Fiji">https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads#Life-Line_Fiji</ext-link>)&#x000a0;and Gatan Microscopy Suite Software (commercially available).
