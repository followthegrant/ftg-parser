WT is usually sporadic, although 1-2% of the patients have a positive family history. Grossly, most cases of WT are large, solitary, gray-white and fleshy, well-circumscribed, rounded and soft in consistency. Cut-sections show predominantly solid pale areas with cystic change, necrosis and hemorrhage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Microscopically, it comprises three major components, undifferentiated blastema, mesenchymal (stromal) tissue and epithelial tissue. When all the three components present together, then it is called a triphasic or classic WT, but it may be bi- or monophasic also.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Additional morphologic features that can be encountered in WT include ciliated mucinous, endocrine cells of various types, renin-producing cells, neuroepithelium, neuroblast, rhabdomyoblast and mature ganglion cells, neuroglia, adipose tissue and cartilage, bone and hematopoietic cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Among the different prognostic factors, stage and histologic type play important roles in assessing the prognosis and survival of patients with WT. Clinicopathological staging of WT is the single most important prognostic determinant. Capsular invasion, rupture at surgery, renal sinus involvement, renal vein invasion, tumor implants, lymph node metastasis and bilaterality are the main criteria used. Favorable and unfavorable histologic types have a great impact on prognosis. Other important prognostic factors are age, extensive tubular differentiation, skeletal muscle differentiation, mucin production, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy, p53 mutation, proliferation marker (MIB-I or Ki67), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), p27 protein expression, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and Type I insulin-like growth factor receptor expression have prognostic significance, but their roles are still not yet well established. This study was carried out to analyze the histopathological spectrum of pediatric renal tumors and to study the expression of proliferation marker (Ki-67) and p53 in WT and correlate its expression in epithelial and blastemal components in different stages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, 27 cases were collected for a period of 2 years. Cases were collected and records were documented as per the following proforma: (a) identification: Name, age, sex, (b) Clinical findings, (c) Radiological findings and (d) Peroperative findings.</p><p>After receiving the specimen containing tumor in buffered formalin, macroscopical examination of the tumor was carried out. A graphic record of the site of each block was indicated on a photograph of the bisected specimen using a digital camera. Besides the adrenal glands, lymph nodes, renal vessels, renal sinus, capsule, pelvis and ureter wherever removed along with the kidney tumor, had been examined and sections were taken to make a pathological staging according to the National Wilms&#x02019; Tumor Study (NWTS-5) staging.</p><p>Hematoxylin-eosin stain was performed and used for tumor diagnosis, histologic type and staging. Further sections were taken on Poly-L-lysine-coated slides from tumor-containing blocks for immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 and p53 using a standard immunohistochemistry protocol.</p><p>We used the statistical data analysis software version 6.0.

In two cases, based on the computed tomography scan findings and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) reports suggestive of WT, pre-operative chemotherapy was administered because of the large size. As these specimens showed extensive necrosis and fibrosis, NWTS-5 staging was not done and these two cases were excluded from the study.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of pediatric renal tumors according to stages</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJMPO-33-102-g003"/></table-wrap><p>Epithelial predominance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>] and blastema predominance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>] were equally distributed and did not show any correlation with the staging.

Among a total of 27 cases of pediatric renal tumors, the incidence of WT was 74.1%, of mesoblastic nephroma was 11.1%, of clear cell sarcoma was 11.1% and of rhabdoid tumor was 3.7%. Our percentage of WT was less than that of the world literature, which is approximately 85%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Because the world literature is based on Western data, this difference may partly be due to the small number of cases present in this study and regional variation due to unknown causes.</p><p>The peak age of WT cases in our study was 1-3 years. This peak age is less than the peak age of the world literature. However, our data matches with that of other Asian studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Regarding sex distribution, in our study, there is a definite male predominance in WT (male:female=1.9:1), which is similar to the study by Mishra, <italic>et al</italic>. and other Asian studies, but the ratio is somewhat greater than that of American/European data.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] This may be because of the social practices favoring the male child, who is more frequently brought to the hospital than the female child.</p><p>Analyzing the distribution of 18 WT cases in different stages according to clinicopathological staging, we had 10 cases (55.55%) in Stage I, six cases (33.33%) in Stage II and one case each (5.5%) in Stage III and Stage IV. Patient numbers in Stage I and II is greater than that in Stage III and IV, which correlates with other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Of the 18 cases, 17 cases (94.4%) showed a favorable histology and only one case (5.6%) had an unfavorable histology. This is similar to the percentage of unfavorable histology of 5% quoted in the Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>We have further analyzed the distribution of proliferation marker (Ki-67) and p53 in different stages of WT, with special reference to various histological components. In our study, it was observed that the PI of the epithelial component was significantly higher than that of blastema in all stages. Others, i.e. Khine, Ghanem and Juszkiewicz, have also made a similar observation; however, none of these studies give any plausible explanation for these observations. This is difficult to understand if the epithelial component is considered as a differentiation product from other components of the tumor. Nephroblastoma is a heterogenous tumor composed of epithelial, blastema and stromal components, and the epithelial component is expected to have the lowest proliferative activity. The dense blastema component, which is considered to be less-differentiated tissue from the epithelium, had a lower proliferation rate than the epithelial component.</p><p>Khine <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] in a study similar to ours, with eight cases of pediatric nephroblastoma, noted that the PI of Ki-67 and PCNA of the epithelial component was higher than that of the other components.</p><p>Ghanem <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] observed increased Ki-67 expression in the epithelial component over the blastema component. They showed that higher PI of Ki-67 was indicative of clinical progression and survival. Although we have not got survival data in our study, we found that the PI was higher in higher stages.</p><p>In a study by Juszkiewicz <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] the PI of neoplastic cells was determined in epithelial, blastema and stromal components of the tumors. In tumors after chemotherapy, a higher PI in epithelial component and a lower index in the blastema component was found.</p><p>Skotnicka-Klonowicz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] found that increased PCNA index in the epithelial component was associated with a higher stage of clinical advancement, as seen in our study.</p><p>It was also observed that PI in Stage II is significantly higher than Stage I for the individual component as well as overall. Statistical analysis could not be performed in other stages due to the small number of cases.</p><p>Sredni <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] found that overall survival was higher for patients with p53 negative than with p53-positive cases, and they concluded that increased p53 expression in WT seems to be associated with advanced disease and relapse.</p><p>Huang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] showed that p53 accumulation in favorable histology WT is associated with angiogenesis and clinically aggressive disease.</p><p>Although this study performed on a small number of cases did not show any statistical significance between p53 expression and staging, higher intensity was noted in Stage II and III.</p><p>Literature on the significance of p53 in WT is more conflicting. In a study by Malkin <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] it was shown that p53 mutation was infrequently seen in WT. However, a later study by Lahoti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] had shown that p53 mutation correlated with recurrence and metastasis. Difference in staining pattern, staining protocol, antibody used and detection system used may be responsible for this discrepancy.</p><p>From this study, we found that in our set-up, WT forms 74.1% of all pediatric renal tumors, with a definite male predominance. Majority of the cases of WT presented in Stage I (55.55%) and Stage II (33.33%). Ki-67 PI was higher in the epithelial component in all stages. Ki-67 PI also increased with increased stage of advancement.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors are particularly thankful to the technical staff, Janababu, Ashimda and Ratnadi, who also actively helped in the work.
