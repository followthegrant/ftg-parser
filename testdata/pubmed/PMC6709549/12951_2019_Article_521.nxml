ATD-NPs was formed by three parts, including PSMA (&#x02212;) prostate cancer specifically targeted part (DUP-PEG-DSPE), ROS-sensitive doxorubicin (DOX) polymeric prodrug (P(L-TK-DOX)), and the ROS generation agent (&#x003b1;-tocopheryl succinate, &#x003b1;-TOS); and this delivery system is expected to enhance PSMA (&#x02212;) prostate cancer therapeutic effect, increase selective accumulation at tumor site and overcome intracellular incomplete drug release. After administration <italic>i.v</italic> injection, ATD-NPs could specifically accumulate in tumor site and markedly be internalized by cancer cells based on the DUP-1 (a PSMA (&#x02212;) cancer cells specific target peptide). Subsequently, ATD-NPs could be dissociated under the high concentration reactive oxygen species (ROS) condition, resulting in DOX and &#x003b1;-TOS release. Then, the released &#x003b1;-TOS could be reacted with mitochondria to produce ROS, which in turn accelerating the release of drugs. Finally achieved the purpose of enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reducing side effect. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of tumor actively-targeted and self-amplifying ROS-responsive drug release showed more significant antitumor activity in the human PSMA (&#x02212;) prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">The described technology unifies the tumor actively targets, self-amplified drug release, and excellent biocompatibility into one formulation, are promising for cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12951-019-0521-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ROS-responsive</kwd><kwd>Self-accelerating</kwd><kwd>PMSA</kwd><kwd>Intracellular ROS amplification</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Suqian Scientific and Technological Innovation Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>17092876549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Lizhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Prostate cancer is one of the major health concerns of male and is usually divided into prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive and negative two types according to the expression of PSMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. PSMA is a type II integral membrane glycoprotein and overexpressed in prostate cells, and now it become a biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis and a target for prostate cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Up to now, many studies focused on PSMA (+) prostate cancer, but few studies of PSMA (&#x02212;) prostate cancer have been carried out due to the absence of appropriate biomarker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, rational designed drug delivery system which can target to PSMA (&#x02212;) cancer cells may avail to prostate cancer therapy. Recently, Zitzmann et al. discovered a PSMA (&#x02212;) ligand: DUP-1 peptide, which could specifically target to PSMA (&#x02212;) cells such as PC-3 cells and DU145 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, DUP-1 could be employed as a ligand for PSMA (&#x02212;) tumor actively-targeted therapy.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, polymeric prodrug micellular-based drug delivery nanosystem (PPM-DDS) has received the favor by researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In which, the drug was conjugated to biocompatible polymers to form a polymeric prodrug, subsequently, the prodrug would translate into active drug once exposed to tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As compared with traditional drug loading methods through non-covalent interactions, the PPM-DDS could achieve high drug loading efficiency, prolong drug circulation time, avoid premature release, reduce side effects and enhance therapy efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, only a few PPM-DDS have achieved good results both in vitro and in vivo, because there are many drawbacks still unsolved and hinder the clinical application of PPM-DDS, specifically including specific target to tumor cells, poor cellular uptake and incomplete drug release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To improve delivery efficiency and specificity tumor-targeting of PPM-DDS, ligand-mediated tumor actively-targeted may be a good strategy. Because after modification targeting ligand on the surface of nanomedicine not only can increase tumor site accumulation, but also can promote cellular uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Various targeted ligands have been developed for targeted drug delivery, such as antibodies, peptides, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Moreover, after internalized by cancer cells, the PPM-DDS should rapidly and completely release drug under a tumor-specific stimulation to exert drugs high therapeutic efficiency to tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Previous studies have been found that the concentration of reactive oxygen species [ROS, including superoxides (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>), hydroxyl radicals (OH&#x000b7;), and hydrogen peroxides (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)] in cancer cells was obviously higher than that of normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Hence, PPM-DDS with ROS-sensitive drug release characteristic is a promising approach to achieve selective and rapid drug release in tumor cells. To construct ROS-responsive drug delivery system, various oxidation-labile groups such as boronic ester, alkylene, and thioketal (TK) have been investigated to develop drug delivery system for tumor treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, affected by the tumor heterogeneity, very few of aforementioned ROS-responsive materials show sufficient sensitivity to efficiently control drug release in cancer cells, because the endogenous ROS levels are too low to trigger drug release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Thus, tumor active-targeted ROS-responsive polymeric prodrug delivery system with ROS generation ability will be a good strategy to promote drug release in cancer cells.</p><p id="Par7">To overcome the aforementioned concerns, here, we proposed a ROS-responsive cascade amplification drug release polymeric prodrug nanoplatform (defined as ATD-NPs) for PSMA (&#x02212;) prostate tumor active targeted therapy (Scheme&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sch1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Firstly, a ROS-response polymeric prodrug was developed by conjugating DOX to the side of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-<italic>b</italic>-poly(<sc>l</sc>-lysine) (PEG-<italic>b</italic>-PLL) copolymer through a ROS-sensitive linker (thioketal linker, TK). Then, the PSMA (&#x02212;) prostate cancer cells specifically targeting module was produced by conjugating DUP-1 peptide to DSPE-PEG (DUP-PEG-DSPE). Finally, the ROS generation agent (&#x003b1;-tocopheryl succinate, &#x003b1;-TOS), ROS-sensitive polymer prodrug, and tumor actively-targeted three parts self-assembled in aqueous solution to form micelles (ATD-NPs). After tail vein administration, ATD-NPs nanoparticles accumulated in tumor tissue through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and DUP-1 mediated actively tumor targeting; and then, the ATD-NPs was internalized by PSMA (&#x02212;) cancer cells. Subsequently, the high concentration ROS would trigger DOX from ATD-NPs by breaking the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive TK linker, this resulting in disassembly of ATD-NPs and the release of &#x003b1;-TOS. Moreover, the released &#x003b1;-TOS could interact with mitochondria and produce ROS, in turn amplify the micelle disassembly and drug release, and thus circulating. We hope the combination of tumor actively-targeted and intracellular ROS amplification in one ATD-NPs would reduce the side effects of the encapsulated anticancer drug and enhance therapeutic efficacy.<fig id="Sch1"><label>Scheme&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Schematic illustration of ATD-NPs for PSMA (&#x02212;) prostate cancer-specific targeted and self-amplifiable drug release</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12951_2019_521_Sch1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

These results could be explained by the fact that when DOX loaded into nanoparticles, which fluorescence was sharply decreased, and under low ROS conditions, the DOX cannot be released from AD-NPs. Therefore, in the AD-NPs group, only weak red fluorescence of DOX can be observed. Moreover, large particle size nanoparticles may prevent DOX entering the nucleus. Hence, in the AD-NPs group, almost no red fluorescence was observed in the nucleus. However, after treated with &#x003b1;-TOS, the cells generated a lot of ROS, which could trigger DOX release from nanoparticles, the fluorescence of DOX could be recovered, and then the free DOX quickly enterer nucleus. Thus, both free &#x003b1;-TOS&#x02009;+&#x02009;AD-NPs group and ATD-NPs group could observe stronger red fluorescence in the cytoplasm and nucleus.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> CLSM images of PC-3 cells treated with ATD-NPs, TD-NPs, AD-NPs, and AD-NPs&#x02009;+&#x02009;&#x003b1;-TOS for 12&#x000a0;h. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold> Intracellular active DOX detected by HPLC in PC-3 cells (<bold>b</bold>) and LNCaP cells (<bold>c</bold>) after treated with ATD-NPs, TD-NPs, AD-NPs, and AD-NPs&#x02009;+&#x02009;&#x003b1;-TOS for different times.

As presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e, the free DOX exhibited the highest cytotoxicity, maybe at the in vitro conditions, DOX can be easily internalized by cells. The cell viability of AD-NPs in PC-3 cells was higher than 60%, even at the dosed as high as 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL (equal to DOX), due to the limited DOX release caused by nonsufficient ROS during the incubation time. When the PC-3 cells were incubated with free &#x003b1;-TOS&#x02009;+&#x02009;AD-NPs, the cell viability sharply decreased, and was significantly lower than AD-NPs group.

Growth of the tumor was inhibited to a certain extent after the treatment with all drugs compared with the PBS control group. The anticancer efficacy of the AD-NPs group was very limited may be because the DOX cannot be effectively released from AD-NPs under intracellular ROS condition. As expected, the tumor growth in the group injected with ATD-NPs was noticeably inhibited, because of the advantages of active tumor targeted and ROS amplification function.
