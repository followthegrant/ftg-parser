Consequently, it is important to refine laboratory procedures and practices to ensure high standards of welfare and scientific data quality. Recent studies have identified that the standard practice of handling laboratory mice by their tails increases behaviours indicative of anxiety, which can be overcome by handling mice using a tunnel. However, despite clear negative effects on mice&#x02019;s behaviour, tunnel handling has yet to be widely implemented. In this study, we provide the first evidence that tail handling also reduces mice&#x02019;s responses to reward. Anhedonia is a core symptom of clinical depression, and is measured in rodents by assessing how they consume a sucrose solution: depressed mice consume less sucrose and the size of their licking bouts when drinking (their &#x02018;lick cluster sizes&#x02019;) also tend to be smaller. We found that tail handled mice showed more anhedonic responses in both measures compared to tunnel handled mice, indicative of a decreased responsiveness to reward and potentially a more depressive-like state. Our findings have significant implications for the welfare of laboratory mice as well as the design and interpretation of scientific studies, particularly those investigating or involving reward.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Laboratory environments can negatively impact on the behaviour, physiology, health and welfare of animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and considerable effort is made to regulate and improve the welfare of animals used in research laboratories around the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Mice are the most widely used species in biomedical research globally; in 2016 they were used in 73% of all procedures in the UK alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Consequently, understanding the experiences of mice used in research is of significant importance in order to be able to provide evidence-based improvements to housing and husbandry that will bring welfare benefits to a large number of animals, and ensure that empirical findings are robust<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Much early work examined the housing in which mice are kept. This revealed that small cage sizes, lack of environmental enrichment, room temperatures and isolation can all negatively impact on mouse welfare, producing measurable changes in behaviour, physiology or affective state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, more recently, it has been proposed that the handling technique used by researchers and laboratory staff influences both the welfare of mice, and the data obtained from behavioural studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The standard practice of handling laboratory mice using their tails has been shown to increase anxiety compared to being handled with a tunnel or by cupping mice on the open hand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>: tunnel handled mice spend more time voluntarily interacting with a handler, and show less anxiety-related behaviour in standardised behavioural tests of anxiety such as the elevated plus maze<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, tail handling can reduce performance in cognitive tests, for example it has been shown to reduce the engagement of mice with a novel mouse odour in a habituation task, resulting in the impairment of the subsequent dishabituation test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, despite the evidence that tail handling can impair welfare and scientific data collection, it remains the main method used to handle mice and other more refined methods such as tunnel handling have yet to be widely implemented across research institutions.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we extend previous work on handling methods to test if being handled by the tail or with a tunnel can affect the hedonic responses of mice towards a rewarding stimulus. Whilst previous studies investigating the effects of handling method on mouse welfare have measured the animals&#x02019; behaviour towards aversive experiences or punishments (such as being picked up by a handler or being placed in a novel test environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>), measuring responses to positive experiences and rewards (hedonic responses) are also important for understanding the full impact of handling methods on the affective state of an animal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. How an animal responds to both punishment and reward offers a way of accessing their enduring negative affective states: whilst anxiety and depression can both be characterized by greater expectation of punishment, depression is also associated with a reduced expectation of reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Stressful life events have been implicated in the aetiology of depression in both humans and animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Specifically, rodent models have shown that exposure to either a single severe (acute) stressor, or several mild (chronic) stressful experiences are sufficient in inducing a depressogenic effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, we predicted that a threatening and stressful stimulus, such as tail handling, could also lead to measurable changes in mouse behavior indicative of a depressed-like state.</p><p id="Par5">Whilst the main approach to studying animal welfare has been to measure the presence or absence of negative affective states, recent papers have highlighted the importance of measuring welfare from their positive experiences, such as pleasure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Responses towards punishing and rewarding stimuli are dissociable, and the neural pathways that deal with punishment and reward are distinct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test if the handling method affects the capacity of mice to experience pleasure from reward.</p><p id="Par6">The reduction or inability to experience pleasure from rewarding stimuli is known as anhedonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Anhedonia is a core symptom of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, and consequently, assessing anhedonia in mice has been important for developing and validating laboratory models of depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Historically, hedonic state has been measured using voluntary consumption of sucrose solutions, under the assumption that anhedonia results in sucrose being perceived as less pleasant and consequently mice would be less motivated to drink it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Animals that have undergone the chronic mild stress manipulation and show behavioural symptoms of depression, will drink less of a sweet solution than control animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This can be reversed through the application of anti-depressants, and has led to sucrose consumption being widely used as an indicator of affective state in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Despite its widespread application and use, the sucrose consumption test is only an indirect indicator of hedonic state. This is because sucrose consumption is influenced by a number of factors: whilst the amount of sucrose solution a mouse drinks may be driven in part by how much it likes the taste, it may also be affected by motivational factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> and the post-ingestive effects of the sucrose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, researchers have sought alternative and more direct measures of hedonic responses towards tastants that are based on a more detailed examination of how an animal drinks. The orofacial movements produced upon tasting a solution and the pattern of licks during consumption are both considered to be more direct measures of palatability and hedonic responses to sucrose consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Therefore, in this study, we measured the effect of handling method not only on the amount of sucrose drunk by mice, but also on a measure of their licking behaviour considered indicative of their hedonic response to reward. When rodents drink, the pattern of licks is not random<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Instead they produce rhythmic sets of licks that can be grouped into clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The number of licks in these clusters, known as &#x02018;lick cluster size&#x02019;, is positively related to the palatability of the tastant: larger lick cluster sizes are elicited by more palatable solutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Moreover, lick cluster size is also affected by the experience and physiology of the animal. This has been demonstrated through manipulations such as conditioned taste aversion which directly devalues flavours (e.g. ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>) and genetic or stress manipulations thought to reduce general hedonic tone (e.g. refs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>) resulting in the reduction of lick cluster sizes elicited by otherwise palatable solutions. We predicted that if handling method affects the hedonic experience of mice from drinking sucrose, then tail handled mice would have lower consumption of, and smaller lick cluster sizes towards, sucrose solutions compared to tunnel handled mice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par9">After habituation to the laboratory, mice underwent a &#x02018;handling phase&#x02019; followed by a &#x02018;sucrose drinking phase&#x02019; (for full details see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Mice were also tested in an elevated plus maze on day 10 to assess their anxiety levels. Consistent with the expectation that tail handling produces higher levels of anxiety than tunnel handling, tail handled mice showed fewer entries onto the open arms (Mann Whitney U&#x02009;=&#x02009;174.5, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2A</xref>), and spent less time on them (Mann Whitney U&#x02009;=&#x02009;175, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2B</xref>) (see Supplementary Information for full details; Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

This result could be a ceiling effect due to testing under mild water restriction, and further work would be needed in order to determine if the anhedonic effects of tail handling are moderated by the nature of the solution being consumed. However, taken together, our combined data indicate that tail handling makes mice more anhedonic and less responsive to reward compared to being handled using a tunnel. Since tail handling is the most widely used method to handle laboratory mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, this finding has significant implications for animal welfare and the refinement of current laboratory practices, as well as scientific data collection, particularly where protocols include or investigate reward.</p><p id="Par15">The presence of anhedonia in our tail handled mice, combined with increased anxiety-like behaviours relative to tunnel handled mice, is indicative of a more depressive-like state, thus suggestive of a more negative affective state in tail handled mice. This pattern of results is similar to treatments which have been explicitly designed to induce depressive-like states in rodents such as the chronic mild stress paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> or chronic restraint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. It may therefore be surprising that tail handling could also produce results similar to these more severe experimental manipulations. However, since tail handling may mimic a predatory attack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, it could be that this handling method is inherently more stressful than currently thought<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Indeed, the degree of difference in consumption for sucrose found in mouse models of depression compared to controls, are very similar to those seen between our tunnel handled and our tail handled mice. At 4% sucrose, the reduction in tail handled mice&#x02019;s consumption compared to that of tunnel handled mice was 27%. From published studies using chronic manipulations to produce models of depression in C57BL/6 mice, we have estimated the reduction in sucrose consumption relative to controls to be in the range of 33&#x02013;57%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Although these are only estimates, this does suggest that the mice could be subject to a similar depressive-like state following tail handling, whether by acute or chronic effect. This could be explored further pharmacologically by the application of anti-depressant compounds.</p><p id="Par16">In addition to detecting effects of tail handling towards positive reward, we also confirmed Hurst and colleagues&#x02019; previous work and replicated their findings at a different research institution. We also found that tail handled mice interacted less with the handler and showed greater levels of anxiety in behavioural tests compared to tunnel handled mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, given that our study was longer than previous published work (days 17, 24 and 31 compared to just days 1, 5 and 9), we were also able to explore the effect of tail handling on mouse behaviour over a longer period of time. The results from our open field test carried out at the end of the experiment still showed a significant effect of handling method on behavioural measures of anxiety, demonstrating that there were still clear behavioural differences. Tail handled mice continued to spend significantly less time interacting with the handler than tunnel handled mice across the entire experiment, although we did detect some changes in their behaviour during the sucrose drinking phase (see supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Tail handled mice increased the time they spent interacting with the handler over the last three voluntary interaction tests, and spent more time interacting with the handler once they had been handled. Although we are unable to draw any firm conclusions from this, there is the possibility that it may be due to forming an association with the sucrose reward, or alternatively perhaps the mice were able to learn about the sequence of events in the repeated voluntary interaction tests. Perhaps mice were more apprehensive of the handler when they were about to be picked up by their tail, compared to when they had already been picked up by their tail because they had learnt that once they had been handled, they were unlikely to be handled again.</p><p id="Par17">Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that mice are more anxious and more anhedonic when they are handled by their tail rather than by using a tunnel. This finding adds to the increasing number of studies that show that tail handling is an aversive procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and that tail handling has a negative impact on the welfare of laboratory mice. It also shows that sucrose consumption and licking behaviour can be used to assess the presence of positive experiences by measuring hedonic responses towards reward. Recent papers have highlighted that to fully understand animal welfare, we need to measure positive experiences, such as pleasure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The ability to assess how an animal responds to rewarding sucrose solutions offers the potential to evaluate the effects of routine laboratory conditions on their affective state and welfare.</p><p id="Par18">Tail handling has been shown to affect data collection through reducing the likelihood that a mouse will engage with a cognitive task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that the effects of tail handling may be more complex than simply not engaging with a task, but could affect how animals respond to rewards in behavioural and cognitive tasks. The vast majority of <italic>in vivo</italic> work involving behavioural paradigms rely on the use of reward to train the animal to perform in the given task, for example, condensed milk is often used to train mice in spatial memory tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> and sucrose pellets are used in operant conditioning tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. If tail handling reduces mice&#x02019;s sensitivity for reward, this may result in longer training periods or reduced effect sizes leading to larger sample sizes being required. Tail handling may also be negatively affecting the neural circuitry underlying reward, which may mean that studies of reward pathways may not be using reliable or accurate models. We recommend that researchers consider the potential effect of tail handling on their results and interpretation of their findings.</p><p id="Par19">In conclusion, we would strongly advocate that, wherever possible, mice should be handled using a tunnel and not by their tails. Tunnel handling is a simple yet effective refinement that has the potential to not only significantly improve animal welfare but also scientific data quality. Based on our own findings and those of others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, we recommend that research institutions should seek to introduce and widely implement tunnel handling as a refinement to their husbandry procedures, and that published protocols for handling mice are revised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethical Statement</title><p id="Par20">Experiments were conducted at Newcastle University following approval from the universities Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB Project ID: 540), and in accordance with the EU Directive (2010/63/EU), ASPA (1986) and the NIH Guidelines for care and use of animals for experimental procedures.

Mice were then only handled by their designated method (tail or tunnel handled) by the same handler wearing nitrile gloves, which were were rubbed in soiling bedding before each handling session (from mice of the same sex and strain) and a laboratory coat that was contaminated with mouse scent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Tail handling involved grasping a mouse at the base of its tail using the thumb and forefinger, and then lifting onto the sleeve of the laboratory coat for 30&#x02009;seconds before being returned to its home cage. For tunnel handling, the mouse was guided into the Perspex tunnel, and lifted above the cage and held for 30&#x02009;seconds. For the first two days, the handler&#x02019;s hands were loosely cupped over the ends of the tunnel to prevent escape. Mice were handled twice daily for 30&#x02009;seconds, 60&#x02009;seconds apart, for the first nine days. Prior to handling, the nesting material (care was taken not to disrupt the structure) and home cage tunnel were removed. This procedure was also conducted once weekly to coincide with the drinking experiments (days 17, 24 and 31). For routine husbandry practices, such as cage cleaning, mice were captured and transferred using their designated handling method either on the sleeve for tail handled mice, or in the tunnel for tunnel handled mice. The same protocol was used when transferring mice to behavioural tests, i.e. the elevated plus maze, open field test and sucrose drinking chambers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Voluntary interaction tests</title><p id="Par23">During the handling phase (days 1, 5 and 9) and the sucrose drinking phase (days 17, 24 and 31), each cage of animals underwent &#x02018;voluntary interaction tests&#x02019; to assess their responses to the handler. These tests allowed a comparison of behaviour in anticipation of being handled compared to after being handled on specified test days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Each test consisted of removing the cage lid, nesting material and home cage tunnel and the handler standing motionless in front of the cage for 60&#x02009;seconds. A gloved hand (tail handled) or a gloved hand holding the home cage tunnel (tunnel handled) was held resting on the substrate in the front of the cage for 60&#x02009;seconds to assess voluntary interaction. Each mouse in the cage was then handled twice for 30&#x02009;seconds by their designated handling method described above, before voluntary interaction was assessed again. Behaviour was filmed and later analysed using Observer XT (v11). Time spent interacting with the handler was measured for each mouse within a cage, from which an overall mean cage score was calculated. These were summed together for analyses for both tail and tunnel handled mice. Therefore, for these tests, the experimental unit was &#x02018;cage&#x02019; (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8 for both groups). Interaction was defined as: sniffing (nose within 0.5&#x02009;cm), touching (including paw contact), climbing on or in the handling tunnel and/or the handler&#x02019;s hand. Due to the differences in how mice in the two treatments were handled during the interaction tests, the observer could not be blind to the treatment, but was blind to whether the interaction test was carried out before or after handling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Elevated Plus Maze</title><p id="Par24">On day 10, mice underwent behavioural testing in an elevated plus maze (dimensions: arms 30&#x02009;cm (L) &#x000d7; 5&#x02009;cm (W) with side walls of 15&#x02009;cm on the two closed arms, elevated 50&#x02009;cm from the ground). Mice were delivered to the centre of the maze (via their designated handling method) facing an open arm and filmed for 5&#x02009;mins and returned to a holding cage or the home cage, depending on whether it was the first or last mouse to undergo testing from its cage. Between subjects, the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol and the running order was counterbalanced with respect to handling method across the testing day. Time spent in the open or closed arms was scored by a treatment blind observer using Observer XT (v11), where the time spent in an arm was defined as being when all four paws were in the arm. Three animals jumped off before the end of the test and were excluded from statistical analysis meaning the sample sizes were reduced (tail handled n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14; tunnel handled n&#x02009;=&#x02009;15).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sucrose Drinking Phase</title><p id="Par25">Mice were trained and tested in eight custom made drinking chambers.

Solutions were delivered through drinking spouts attached to 50&#x02009;ml falcon tubes. Drinking chambers were connected to contact sensitive Med Associates dual contact lickometers (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, Vermont), which transmitted the time of each lick to the nearest 0.01&#x02009;second to a computer using MED-PC software. Custom-built software calculated the lick cluster sizes according to a range of interbout intervals, which is the length of time used to determine when licks can be considered to be in a single bout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>.
