In the liver, glycogen is used to keep blood glucose at physiological levels, whereas in muscle glycogen is used as an energy source for muscle cells. Formation of glycogen (glycogenesis) from glucose is a multistep process regulated by various enzymes (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The enzyme glycogenin is considered to be essential for initiating de novo glycogen synthesis. By autoglucosylation, glycogenin generates an oligosaccharide chain of approximately 7 to 12 glucose residues, which are linearly linked by &#x003b1;1,4-glycosidic bonds and covalently linked to the glycogenin apoprotein by a tyrosine-O-glucose binding. Glycogen synthase adds further glucose molecules to the priming oligosaccharide chain by formation of more &#x003b1;1,4-glycosidic linkages. Branching enzyme adds glucose molecules by &#x003b1;1,6-glycosidic linkages, which leads to branching of the molecule. By this process, the glycogen molecule grows to form the glycogen &#x003b2; particle, consisting of approximately 30 000 glucose molecules, and these &#x003b2; particles can be linked together to form even larger &#x003b1; particles. Glycogenin is found in 2 isoforms, glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2, which are encoded by 2 separate genes, <italic>GYG1</italic> and <italic>GYG2</italic>, respectively. Glycogenin-1 is a 39-kDa protein (the GN1L-isoform) that is ubiquitously expressed. Functional glycogenin-2, a 55-kDa protein (the &#x003b1;-isoform) that resembles glycogenin-1 structurally and functionally, is also expressed in the liver (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In glycogenin-1, the tyrosine-O-glucose bond is at position Tyr195, whereas in glycogenin-2 the glucose is attached to Tyr228.</p><p>Glycogen storage disease type XV/polyglucosan body myopathy 2 (OMIM#613507/#616199) is caused by biallelic mutations in the <italic>GYG1</italic> gene. Since the first report in 2010 (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), more than 30 patients with glycogenin-1 deficiency have been described. Most of these patients had adult-onset, slowly progressive myopathy and muscle weakness without cardiomyopathy (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;14</xref>), but there have also been reports of patients presenting with cardiomyopathy without muscle weakness, leading to severe cardiac failure (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Patients with <italic>GYG1</italic> mutations are characterized by either the absence of glycogenin-1 or the expression of nonfunctional glycogenin-1, and there is storage of glycogen and polyglucosan in the affected tissues.</p><p>Despite the fact that glycogenin is considered to be essential for de novo glycogen synthesis (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), glycogen is present in the skeletal muscle of glycogenin-1&#x02013;deficient patients. This finding challenges the generally accepted concept that glycogenin is required for glycogen synthesis, and it has been speculated that glycogenin-2 may act as an alternative primer for glycogen synthesis (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In 1 study, Western blot analysis of glycogenin-2 was performed on muscle from 2 patients with glycogenin-1 deficiency, and bands believed to be glycogenin-2 were identified in the patients, but no functional glycogenin-2 was demonstrated (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the hypothesis that upregulation of expression of functional glycogenin-2 may substitute for glycogenin-1 deficiency in cardiac and skeletal muscle, we investigated the expression of glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2 by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle from controls and in heart and skeletal muscle from patients with biallelic <italic>GYG1</italic> mutations.</p><sec sec-type="materials" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Participants</title><p>This study included biopsy specimens from 5 previously described unrelated patients with biallelic pathogenic <italic>GYG1</italic> mutations (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A summary of the results of clinical and laboratory examinations is given in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Patients 1, 2, and 3 (Pt1, Pt2, and Pt3) had pure myopathy without signs or symptoms of cardiomyopathy, whereas patients 4 and 5 (Pt4 and Pt5) presented with cardiomyopathy and minor or no signs and symptoms of skeletal myopathy. Skeletal muscle specimens from Pt1, Pt2, and Pt3 were obtained by open biopsy. Cardiac muscle specimens were obtained by endomyocardial biopsy and heart explants after transplantation in Pt4 and Pt5. Control skeletal muscle (M1, M2, and M3) included muscle biopsy specimens from individuals who had been investigated for a possible muscle disorder but in whom the investigation excluded muscle disease. There were control cardiac muscles from 2 individuals with no apparent cardiac disease who had donated their hearts for transplantation, but who had been excluded (H1 and H2). Two additional cardiac muscle controls (H3 and H4) were from explanted hearts in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Control liver came from liver biopsies performed for diagnostic purposes. In 2 cases, liver disease was excluded after investigation (L1 and L2), and 2 cases showed fibrosis (L3 and L4). The liver and muscle specimens used as immunohistochemical staining controls were obtained from routine diagnostic work at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of patients with glycogenin-1 deficiency who were investigated in this study.</p></caption><table frame="vsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pt1</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pt2</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pt3</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pt4</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pt5</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">M</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">F</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">M</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">M</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">M</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Origin</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Italy</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spain</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Germany</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">New Zealand and UK</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sweden</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age at onset, y</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">82</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">65</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">62</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">34</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Probably childhood</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Initial symptoms</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Progressive pain and weakness in upper left arm</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Difficulties climbing stairs and walking</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Difficulties climbing stairs and walking</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shortness of breath, chest pain on exertion, lethargy, and palpitations</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shortness of breath and upper arm weakness</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age at examination, y</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">84</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">72</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">72</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">48</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">27</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical features </td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weakness in proximal and distal upper and lower limbs, partly asymmetric</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shoulder and hip girdle muscle weakness</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hip girdle and thigh muscle weakness and atrophy; milder asymmetric weakness of shoulder girdle and upper arm muscles</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cardiac failure.

To identify glycogenin, which is located inside the large glycogen molecules, digestion with &#x003b1;-amylase is necessary to degrade glycogen and obtain free glycogenin protein for gel electrophoresis. Fifty U/mL human &#x003b1;-amylase (Sigma-Aldrich) in a total volume of 25 &#x003bc;L phosphate-buffered saline pH 6.5 was added to approximately 1 to 2 mg muscle tissue cut into sections in a cryostat and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 hour, before proceeding to protein extraction and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The transfer was performed using the iBlot Dry Blotting System (Life Technologies). The membrane was blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with SuperBlock blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C with the primary antibodies. Glycogenins were detected with primary antiglycogenin-1 antibody M07 clone 3B5 (Abnova) at a dilution of 1:500 and primary antiglycogenin-2 antibody (HPA005495; Atlas Antibodies) at a dilution of 1:1000. For detection, we used horseradish peroxidase&#x02013;conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:1000). SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate or SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was applied and an enhanced chemiluminescent detection Western blotting system (Fujifilm LAS-4000 system) was used for visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Morphological and immunohistochemical analysis</title><p>Histochemical analyses of skeletal and cardiac muscle were performed on fresh-frozen tissue specimens and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver specimens. Eight-&#x003bc;m-thick cryostat sections were fixed in acetone for 10 minutes and washed in TRIS-buffered saline-Tween for 10 minutes; 5-&#x003bc;m-thick paraffin sections were used without fixation. The specimens were stained with periodic acid&#x02013;Schiff (PAS) reagent using a standard protocol to determine the presence of glycogen (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Immunohistochemical detection of free glycogenin-1 (M07 clone 3B5; Abnova, 1:500) and glycogenin-2 (HPA005495; Atlas Antibodies, 1:100) was performed using a Dako Autostainer and using the Dako EnVision FLEX High pH kit according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s standard protocol. Primary antibodies were applied for 1 hour. The Dako Liquid DAB+ Substrate Chromogen System was used to visualize positive staining material. For electron microscopy, small tissue specimens were directly fixed in glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer, postfixed in osmium tetroxide, and embedded in resin. The contrast of ultrathin sections was enhanced by uranyl acetate and lead citrate.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>To identify glycogenin-2 protein in polyacrylamide gels, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed. Proteomic analyses were performed at the Proteomics Core Facility at the Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, according to standard protocols. Gel pieces corresponding to functional glycogenin-2, identified by Western blot analysis, were destained with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile, in-gel digested by addition of 10 ng/&#x003bc;L trypsin (Pierce MS grade, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C.

Such focal depletion of PAS-positive glycogen, which can be seen in some neuromuscular disorders, is presumably a result of uneven consumption of the glucose stored in glycogen molecules, thereby exposing the glycogenin-1 epitopes in such regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

In this study we investigated the expression of the 2 isoforms of human glycogenin, glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2, in controls and in patients with glycogenin-1 deficiency. In accordance with previously published results, we detected expression of both glycogenin-1 and glycogenin-2 in liver tissue (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, only glycogenin-1 was identified in the skeletal muscle and heart of controls. Glycogenin-2 transcripts have been identified in cardiac muscle in a previous study (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, in the Genotype-Tissue Expression database, glycogenin-1 is highly expressed in the heart but glycogenin-2 is not, which is in line with the results from previous protein analyses (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>In the present study we found no upregulation of expression of glycogenin-2 in patients with glycogenin-1 deficiency, either in heart tissue or in skeletal muscle. The role of glycogenin-2 is not clear. It is mainly expressed in fat tissue (according to the Genotype-Tissue Expression database), but Western blot does not indicate that glycogenin-2 is associated with glycogen in fat tissue because &#x003b1;-amylase treatment does not increase the intensity of the band (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The importance of glycogenin-2 for liver glycogen metabolism is also unclear because there is a common deletion (affecting 1% of the population [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]), removing the <italic>GYG2</italic> gene, which is located on the X chromosome. Men who are hemizygous for the deletion and therefore completely lack glycogenin-2 have no apparent phenotype, normal blood glucose, a normal glucagon stimulation test, and normal liver glycogen as determined by light and electron microscopy (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>As shown in this study, glycogenin-1 is also dispensable for glycogen synthesis in muscle and the heart and there is no compensatory upregulation of functional glycogenin-2. These findings are in accordance with the results of studies on glycogenin knockout mice, in which the glycogen content was found to be even higher in glycogenin-deficient mice than in controls (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Mice have only one glycogenin gene, and no other protein bound covalently to glycogen has been identified, indicating that glycogen synthesis can occur without a protein primer such as glycogenin (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Synthesis of glycogen without glycogenin being present can also occur in other organisms such as bacteria (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and yeast (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>The finding that lack of glycogenin does not induce glycogen depletion indicates that glycogenin may have important functions other than being a primer for glycogen synthesis. It has been demonstrated that glycogenin strongly interacts with glycogen synthase (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), but the functional importance of such interaction is not known. An imbalance between the functional activity of glycogen synthase and branching enzyme has been proposed to be a cause of polyglucosan storage, as seen in equine polysaccharide storage disease, which is caused by a dominant glycogen synthase mutation (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), in mice overexpressing glycogen synthase (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and in humans with branching enzyme deficiency (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Whether glycogenin-1 deficiency affects the balance between glycogen synthase and branching enzyme activities in muscle remains to be investigated, and there are many other factors implicated in the formation of polyglucosan such as in Lafora disease, which is another polyglucosan storage disease (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Immunohistochemical staining of glycogenin-1 in cardiac muscle revealed accumulation of glycogenin-1 in the regions showing storage of PAS-positive material, which was found by electron microscopy to be composed of a mixture of fibrillar and granular material. This storage of glycogen and polyglucosan thus includes mutated glycogenin-1, probably together with a large number of other proteins that are normally associated with glycogen. The mutated glycogenin-1 is nonfunctional because it lacks the ability to autoglucosylate, but it can probably bind to glycogen synthase, which is 1 of many proteins associated with glycogen (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). An important question is whether expression of mutated glycogenin-1 does in fact cause cardiomyopathy since patients who completely lack glycogenin-1 because of biallelic truncating <italic>GYG1</italic> mutations do not develop cardiomyopathy. In skeletal muscle, glycogenin-1 is therefore not present in the storage material of most patients, as demonstrated in Pt1 in our study.</p><p>In conclusion, we have found that glycogenin-1 is dispensable for glycogen synthesis in humans, which has also been shown in mice. This finding challenges the concept of glycogenin being an obligate primer for de novo glycogen synthesis. Glycogenin-1 deficiency leads to glycogen storage and polyglucosan formation, indicating that glycogenin-1 is involved in the regulation of glycogen synthesis in muscle, which needs to be further studied.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="a1"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>
