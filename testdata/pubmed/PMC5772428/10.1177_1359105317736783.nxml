Using an Ecological Model of Adolescent Behavior, we explore the perceptions of 85 young people and 10 stakeholders on sexual risk behavior of adolescents in Kilifi County on the coast of Kenya. Our findings show that transactional sex, early sexual debut, coerced sex, and multiple sexual partnerships are prevalent. An urgent need exists to develop measures to counter sexual risk behaviors. The results contribute to understanding the range of risks and protective factors in differing contexts, tackling underlying issues at individual, family, local institutional, wider socio-economic, and political levels.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adolescence</kwd><kwd>qualitative methods</kwd><kwd>risk factors</kwd><kwd>sexual behavior</kwd><kwd>youth</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1359105317736783"><funding-source id="funding1-1359105317736783"><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-1359105317736783">MR/M025454/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1359105317736783"><title>Background</title><p>Sexual risk behavior (SRB) and forms of sexual exploitation faced by adolescents in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) need to be addressed, since SRB, such as early sexual debut, multiple sexual partnerships, unprotected sex, intimate partner violence, and sexual exploitation through early marriage and transactional sex, have been extensively documented among adolescents within this region (<xref rid="bibr1-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Bankole et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr15-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Idele et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Wamoyi et al., 2015</xref>).

Teenage pregnancy rate is highest (21%) at the Kenyan coast, and the unmet need for family planning among married adolescent girls (15&#x02013;19&#x02009;years) is 59&#x02009;percent, which is twice more than the national prevalence of 23&#x02009;percent (<xref rid="bibr19-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">KNBS and ICF International, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, other concerns of sexual violence, sexual tourism, early marriages, and high school dropout rates are reported at the Kenyan coast (<xref rid="bibr26-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">National AIDS Control Council (NAAC), 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">National Crime Research Centre (NCRC), 2014</xref>), which emphasize the urgent need for intervention around adolescent SRB in this context. Adolescent SRB has been linked to consequences such as high teenage pregnancy (currently at 18% in Kenya) (<xref rid="bibr33-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Obare et al., 2016</xref>), unsafe abortions, school dropout, mental ill health, and sexually transmitted infections (<xref rid="bibr12-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Godia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Juma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">UNICEF et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The assessment of different forms of SRB and their facilitating or contextual factors is a vital step toward designing effective strategies and interventions for SRB (<xref rid="bibr14-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Hanson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr45-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Wight et al., 2016</xref>). In the Kenyan context, just a few studies have comprehensively explored underlying factors for adolescents&#x02019; SRB. In western Kenya, socio-cultural factors such as funeral ceremonies, boy child preference, early marriage, and widow inheritance are among reported factors for SRB (<xref rid="bibr16-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Juma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Njue et al., 2009</xref>). Studies from Central (<xref rid="bibr9-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Caroline and Orpinas, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Marston et al., 2013</xref>) and Eastern (<xref rid="bibr32-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Nzioka, 2001</xref>) regions of Kenya describe peer pressure, low risk perception, lack of parental supervision, lack of school attendance, family dysfunction, alcohol and drug use, delinquent behavior, and gender norms as some predisposing factors for adolescent SRB. Nonetheless, it is not clear whether unique factors explain the disproportionately poor state of ASRH at the Kenyan coast since there is a paucity of literature on drivers of adolescent SRB associated with this specific setting. This presents challenges in guiding intervention and policy development (<xref rid="bibr26-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">NAAC, 2016</xref>). We therefore seek to engage adolescents and local community stakeholders to reflect on mechanisms by which SRB is generated and normalized within their context, as this avoids attributing SRB to merely broad and generic social norms (<xref rid="bibr14-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Hanson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To contribute toward a clearer understanding of the prevalent adolescent SRB and their underlying factors, we conducted a qualitative study to understand young people&#x02019;s and stakeholders&#x02019; perspectives on SRB among adolescents (10&#x02013;19&#x02009;years) in Kilifi County at the Kenyan coast. Specifically, we explored perceptions of (1) most common forms of SRB, (2) predisposing or risk factors for SRB, and (3) protective factors against SRB among adolescents. We draw on the perceptions of young people and a range of other community stakeholders to explore diversity and the convergence of viewpoints and factors underlying adolescent SRB behavior within this setting.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1359105317736783"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p>We utilize the Ecological Model of Adolescent Behavior by <xref rid="bibr6-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Blum et al. (2001)</xref>, which provides a logical account of underlying factors responsible for the distribution and occurrence of adolescent risk behavior. This model draws on ecological systems theory which posits that understanding human development requires the examination of multi-person systems of interaction and that this should take into consideration the numerous aspects of the environment beyond an immediate situation concerning the subject (<xref rid="bibr8-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Bronfenbrenner, 1977</xref>). The model by Blum and colleagues postulates that there are intricate mechanisms that underlie risk behavior and these involve interactions of multiple explanatory domains (<xref rid="bibr6-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Blum et al., 2001</xref>). This model proposes six major explanatory domains or sources of behavioral variation and each of these domains comprises risk factors and protective factors. These domains are as follows: (1) individual, (2) family, (3) peers, (4) school, (5) social environment, and (6) macro-environment (<xref rid="bibr6-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Blum et al., 2001</xref>). All the domains are presumed to have direct effects on adolescent risk behavior; however, there is interplay of factors within and across domains, which explains the various forms of risk and protection. Moreover, various domains of risk can also have indirect effects on risk behavior. The model presumes a bi-directionality between the risk factors and behavioral outcomes, that is, engaging in a risk behavior can also affect the various domains of risk factors. The protective factors are considered to moderate or counter-balance and thus mitigate the impacts of risk on adolescent behavior (<xref rid="bibr6-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Blum et al., 2001</xref>). This model suggests that family, peer, and school influences on the adolescent fall within a broader social environment which also ultimately lies within a macro-environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section3-1359105317736783"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section4-1359105317736783"><title>Study setting and participants</title><p>This qualitative study was conducted between August and November 2016 at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KWTRP), which has its main base within Kilifi County at the Kenyan coast. Data were collected within a well-defined health and demographic surveillance area, the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS). By 2011, the population of KHDSS was estimated at 270,000 residents, and 49&#x02009;percent were less than 15&#x02009;years (<xref rid="bibr36-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2012</xref>). The residents mainly belong to the Mijikenda ethnic group, which is a Bantu group comprising nine sub-groups with a majority (45%) being Giriama.

Initial contact was made with a small number of researchers at the Centre for Geographic Medicine Research-Coast (CGMR-C) in Kilifi whose work involved adolescents. They recommended additional key informants who should be contacted for interviews, based on experience of working with adolescents living with HIV. This process was repeated with all new interviewees to continue to identify participants sharing relevant perspectives for the study. In the school setting, head teachers suggested a contact teacher (who in most cases was a guidance and counseling teacher) who served as a key informant.</p><p>At KWTRP, we were able to draw on an existing network of community representatives to identify participants for this study (<xref rid="bibr17-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Kamuya et al., 2013</xref>). Using an existing database of around 200 community representatives in the Community Engagement department at KWTRP, we purposively selected community members aiming to reflect diversity within a young adult population, taking account of residential area (peri-urban or rural settings), education status, sex, and religion.</p><p>For school-going adolescents, we purposively identified two primary and two secondary schools in the KHDSS area, as before aiming to explore diversity. Characteristics identified included the setting and type of schools, specifically, schools in peri-urban and rural settings, and day schools attended by both male and female students. For study purposes, we considered Kilifi town as a reference peri-urban setting and areas with limited social services and within 10 or more kilometers from Kilifi town as rural settings. In consultation with Kilifi County Education Office and researchers at the CGMR-C with ongoing work within the school setting, we identified the four schools. Upper-primary school students (i.e. from class 5 to class 8) and lower-secondary school students (i.e. from forms 1 and 2) were purposively recruited from class records with a specific consideration of sex, religion, and age. School dropout adolescents were recruited with assistance from the County department of Public Health&#x02019;s community support staff. Recruitment of the school dropout adolescents was done by purposively selecting them from two community health catchment units with consideration of age, sex, and religious diversity. The adolescents living with HIV were recruited from the youth club at the comprehensive care and research clinic of KCH, and some were recruited directly from the community through home visits to families of HIV-infected adolescents by a worker from the KCH.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1359105317736783"><title>Ethical consideration</title><p>All recruitment processes involved obtaining prior written informed consent.

For school-going adolescents, FGDs were conducted within the school and were sex disaggregated. Young adult community representatives, adolescents living with HIV, and those who had dropped out of school were invited to participate in FGDs at the KWTRP, in a private and quiet setting. Participants (young adults) and caretakers of adolescents who were invited to CGMR-C were given 300 Kenyan shillings (about US$3) to compensate for time spent, and transport expenses were reimbursed.

For each form of behavior, respondents&#x02019; perceptions were explored using a general open-ended question, followed by additional probing, that asked them to explain the specific forms of risky behaviors which they perceive as commonly undertaken by adolescents aged 10&#x02013;19&#x02009;years in Kilifi. We only probed further on specific examples or context of SRB that were raised by the participants and thus all the perceptions documented in this article were spontaneous views from the participants.

This was dependent on the extent to which the participants perceived accessibility, quality, and comprehensiveness of these services within the county. Where young people and key informants perceived ASRH services in Kilifi to be poor in quality and not adolescent-friendly, they expressed fears about seeking these services at government health centers. Some adolescents described that their peers chose to take condoms from health facilities at night when no one would notice. Poor prioritization of adolescent specific services by sexual health service planners and providers was also described as underpinning SRB. Furthermore, a lack of effective behavioral change communication methods and forums for girls to learn about contraception and safe sex was discussed:<disp-quote><p>It is like educating the youth about this issue (AIDS) has been neglected &#x02026; many people here assume contraceptive matters are for those who already have children.

During their discussions, a mix of ASRH services and their providers were identified by the participants. For example, adolescents mentioned private clinics, public health facilities, and peer educators as sources of services such as condoms, ASRH information, emergency contraceptives (e-pills), and long-term birth control methods. The key informants also mentioned similar examples in addition to teens&#x02019; club, condom dispensers in recreational places such as pubs and the chief&#x02019;s office as sources of ASRH.</p></sec><sec id="section14-1359105317736783"><title>Social events</title><p>Particular social events, especially traditional ceremonies like parties at funerals and weddings, were often perceived as occasions during which many adolescents might either engage in SRB or face a risk of sexual exploitation. During such events, unprotected sex, sexual violence, cross-generational sex, and other behaviors were described as common, related to limited monitoring by parents and other authorities, and the use of drugs and alcohol:<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; in that <italic>matanga</italic> (a local word referring to funeral ceremonies), there is free sex. &#x02026; You see it is a chance for these adolescents to engage in sex.

Some adolescents were thought to have easier access to sexual networks through these channels, especially when they owned mobile phones or had access to social media platforms like Facebook<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>. In this situation, &#x0201c;grooming&#x0201d; was also described as a potential risk:<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; in other cases you may meet someone in Facebook.

Some key informants and young people felt that female adolescents living in the rural part of Kilifi are more likely to face injustices of sexual exploitation like early marriage and coerced sex. However, one key informant also felt that Kilifi town&#x02019;s fast rate of urbanization can be linked to increase in the various cases of SRB such as prostitution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section19-1359105317736783"><title>Individual-level factors</title><sec id="section20-1359105317736783"><title>Low risk awareness</title><p>Adolescents were seen to have low awareness of the risks of contracting sexually transmitted infections through unprotected sexual activity, a characteristic associated with SRB. It was shared that, for many sexually active adolescents, the fear of getting pregnant was greater than that of contracting sexually transmitted infections. In this situation, adolescents were seen as more likely to use birth control methods, such as emergency contraceptive pills, that give little or no protection against sexually transmitted infections instead of using condoms. Moreover, adolescents were seen to make judgments in ways that reflected their immediate concerns and interpretations of risk and were not necessarily well informed:<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; we got 5 girls who told us &#x02026; What they use is the morning after pills. They said, &#x0201c;We fear giving birth unlike contracting HIV/AIDS. With HIV/AIDS, we know after getting it, there are ARVs.

These may influence their responses, sometimes in ways that predispose them to SRB. In relation to physical changes, some described that the development of secondary sexual characteristics in young women could increase the risks of their becoming targets for sexual harassment. It was thought that some young men may experience a very strong sexual attraction to girls who have developed secondary sexual characteristics in ways that they (the men) find difficult to control:<disp-quote><p>So the girls might have big breasts and the hips. So when a boy sees that, he might have that feeling to go and have sex.

These challenges were seen to result from men&#x02019;s (who in many cases are older) direct refusal to use condoms or due to manipulation and accusations about unfaithfulness from the male partners:<disp-quote><p>The girls usually prefer using protection but some of the men are the ones who refuse.

Poverty was described in terms of a failure by caregivers to provide for a young person&#x02019;s basic needs such as school fees, clothing, food, sanitary pads to adolescent girls, transport fare, and pocket money. As before, this can lead adolescents to engage in transactional sex to acquire these necessities:<disp-quote><p>Like when we girls are on our periods and you have requested your parents to give you money but they refuse, at that point you really don&#x02019;t know what to do so you are forced to go out and search from the sugar daddy.

While some parents&#x02019; behaviors could directly put their children at risk of sexual exploitation, both young people and other stakeholders in this study felt that parents&#x02019; roles were very important in guiding their children towards behaviors likely to be protective against SRB. Positive parental influences included encouraging sexual abstinence and keeping track of their children&#x02019;s movements, friendships, and pastimes. As an example of mothers modeling responsible contraceptive practices, a female peri-urban secondary school student explained,<disp-quote><p>They will get to know about family planning pills from their mothers &#x02026; so they buy them to avoid pregnancies &#x02026; they are buying those medicines because their mothers have shown them.

That teacher was making her stay behind all the times and then the girl did not know because she was young &#x02026; she was in class six&#x02026; (Group 6, female, peri-urban primary school)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Some key informants also described sexual relationships between pupils at school as an important and common risk factor for sexual health. One clinician explained this situation as follows:<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; especially when school opens, like in September when &#x02026; there are burst condoms, unprotected sex and increase in prostitution. (KI, clinician, female, 30)</p></disp-quote></p><p>In connection to protective benefits, some adolescent boys attending primary schools in peri-urban areas felt that enforced rules and regulations would make sure that students focused on their studies and would be less likely to engage in SRB. School attendance itself was perceived by young people as a protective factor, through enhancing ASRH knowledge and prompting safer sexual behavior. Additionally, some stakeholders felt that specific school structures or programs with an ASRH aspect offered significant protection against SRB, including school clubs and school counseling and guidance services. As one school teacher explained,<disp-quote><p>You see also in our school, guidance and counseling is being emphasized. &#x02026; we are encouraging them, we have this club of child rights. And we also have some signs which we are looking at from the girls. It is easy to identify that such a girl is undergoing torture; may be sexual abuse, physically, psychologically. (KI, primary school teacher, male, 48&#x02009;years)</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="section33-1359105317736783"><title>School dropout</title><p>Furthermore, dropping out of school was discussed in a few adolescent FGDs as contributing to sexual risk-taking. For this group, the difficulty in finding paid employment typical of the area could lead adolescents to take on transactional forms of sex to obtain gifts or money.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section34-1359105317736783"><title>Macro-level factors</title><p>A few participants (including two teachers, two CBO employees, and a clinician) discussed macro-level risk factors, that is, factors that operate at a population level.</p><sec id="section35-1359105317736783"><title>Societal changes</title><p>Among the macro-level factors noted was the perception that a set of changes in society over time have together promoted risky sexual behavior. These changes included that adolescents normalize early sexual behavior, a deteriorating quality of parenting, and a general sense that society has lost its moral basis. As one key informant shared,<disp-quote><p>I can go to a rural place there, and am sure this lady has a boyfriend or is married, but if I have money I can just take the lady from him &#x02026; that is the problem with the society now days. It is about you being financially stable. It is not about the traditions and morals anymore. (KI, CBO employee, male, 27&#x02009;years)</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="section36-1359105317736783"><title>Restrictive ASRH policies</title><p>Also, some policies surrounding ASRH were considered restrictive. Some stakeholders explained that although there is demand by adolescents for certain ASRH services, like longer term contraception, the present policy framework prohibits provision of such services to those under 18&#x02009;years:<disp-quote><p>This injection that women get. In fact it is the most preferred contraception among the girls &#x02026; the private doctors will give them. It is an illegal thing but you realize that most of the girls will be using it. (KI, secondary school teacher, female, 51&#x02009;years)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Another participant who is a clinician also stated,<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; the issue was with the policies. We couldn&#x02019;t give contraceptives to those under 18. (KI, clinician, female, 30&#x02009;years)</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="section37-1359105317736783"><title>Traditional customs and beliefs</title><p>Some key informants suggested that certain traditional beliefs and customs, particularly those encouraging early marriage, may infringe adolescents&#x02019; rights and freedom of choice, as well as predispose to SRB. As described earlier, this issue also acts at the level of the family, highlighting diversity between family contexts and the interrelated nature of categories within the Ecological Framework drawn on in this article:<disp-quote><p>One which is common is the old men taking young girls. In our culture that is very common. The Mijikenda men, they believe that after a certain age such as 40 and above, a man should have a younger wife. We call such a wife Kiboma.

They gave various scenarios in which the local authorities such as the local police and Chief&#x02019;s office took action when such crimes were reported in Kilifi. One, for example, narrated,<disp-quote><p>Somebody sleeps with his own daughter &#x02026; until she becomes pregnant, the case is taken to the Chief &#x02026; There is one who was imprisoned just the day before yesterday. (Group 11, male, young adult)</p></disp-quote></p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section39-1359105317736783"><title>Discussion</title><p>Young people and stakeholders&#x02019; perceptions suggest that a range of SRBs occur among adolescents in Kilifi, especially transactional sex, early sexual debut, unprotected sex, and multiple sexual partnerships. Similarly, sexual violence is reported as common and the adolescent girls seem to bear the brunt. The occurrence of SRB and violence among Kenyan adolescents (<xref rid="bibr16-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Juma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Marston et al., 2013</xref>) and adolescents from other parts of SSA (<xref rid="bibr25-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2007</xref>) is widely documented. Our findings support those of reports from the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (<xref rid="bibr19-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">KNBS and ICF International, 2014</xref>) that show a high occurrence of teenage pregnancies and payment for sex in Kilifi County, although this health survey data did not comprehensively explore factors underlying these behavioral patterns.</p><p>Our findings also indicate that the social environment presents a milieu for a majority of the risk factors. Significant among these factors is the lack of pragmatic youth-friendly ASRH services. We suggest that the difficulties in safe sex negotiation, and insufficient knowledge and misconceptions about sexual health described by participants in this study are likely consequences of poor ASRH services. Similar to our findings, socio-psychological factors such as concerns about confidentiality, fear and embarrassment, and poor accessibility and unaffordability have been described as serious bottlenecks for youth-friendly services targeting adolescents from Kenya (<xref rid="bibr12-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Godia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">National Coordinating Agency for Population and Development (NCAPD) et al., 2011</xref>) and across SSA (<xref rid="bibr5-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Biddlecom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr11-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Geary et al., 2014</xref>). With only 7&#x02009;percent of Kenyan health facilities providing youth-friendly services (<xref rid="bibr27-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">NCAPD et al., 2011</xref>), the need for comprehensive adolescent-friendly ASRH remains urgent.</p><p>Furthermore, our participants&#x02019; views underscore the devastating impacts of household poverty on ASRH. These effects are cross-cutting and may link to certain social environment factors like engagement of adolescent girls in risky commercial activities, dropping out of school, and sexual exploitation of adolescents by tourists following the pursuit for financial and material gains. Likewise, poverty may propagate materialistic tendency portrayed by some adolescents as earlier reported under the individual-level factors. Indeed, survey data from across Kenya show that adolescents from the most poor households are most likely to be engaged in sexual activity and not to be using contraceptives both in rural and urban areas (<xref rid="bibr19-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">KNBS and ICF International, 2014</xref>). Although this is the case, the evidence is mixed in that some studies indicate that household income may or may not predict certain forms of SRB and that these effects may vary from one country to another, or by sex and age of the adolescent (<xref rid="bibr3-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Berhan and Berhan, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr13-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Handa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Madise et al., 2007</xref>) This points to a need for more research to delineate the effects of household income on adolescent sexual health.</p><p>Additionally, parenting style was another topic of discussion with views that &#x0201c;neglectful&#x0201d; parenting predisposes adolescents to SRB and that there are opportunities for parents to support safer behavior in relation to sexual health. We propose that this factor is linked to other perceived risk factors such as negative modeling, school dropout, and attendance at &#x0201c;risky&#x0201d; social events. Correspondingly, a study from rural Western Kenya identified poor caregiver monitoring as a predisposing factor for SRB among adolescents (<xref rid="bibr34-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Puffer et al., 2011</xref>). To this end, findings from other parts of SSA also indicate that low levels of parental monitoring and poor parent&#x02013;adolescent communication are associated with elevated risk of adolescent sexual activity for both male and female adolescents (<xref rid="bibr4-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Biddlecom et al., 2009</xref>). This highlights the need for SRH interventions to incorporate aspects of parental or caregiver involvement.</p><p>The current findings also suggest that insecurity within the community facilitates the occurrence of various forms of sexual violence, especially against adolescent girls. More worrisome is that home and school environments where the majority of the adolescents spend most of their time are perceived as unsafe. These views are consistent with other findings from Kenya, which indicate that home environment may often be unsafe for adolescents and that perpetrators of sexual crimes are most likely to be close family members such as fathers and siblings, or peers and teachers at school (<xref rid="bibr35-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Ruto, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">UNICEF et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Emerging from these issues, our findings highlight that gender inequality is a major concern in relation to adolescent SRB and human rights more broadly. In our data, varying risk factors associated with gender cross ecological domains to reinforce susceptibility to SRB, especially for the female adolescents. Among these risk factors are the Mijikenda patrilineal culture that supports male dominance, thereby creating power asymmetries at environmental and family levels; poverty that disproportionately exposes girls and young women to sexual harms and exploitation; and gendered cultural practices such as early girl marriage. Gender inequality has also been highlighted in other studies from Kilifi with examples such as maternal blame for health problems within the family and the lack of autonomy for females to participate in certain health programs without permission from men within the household (<xref rid="bibr18-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Kamuya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Marsh et al., 2011</xref>). These findings emphasize the need to incorporate an intersectional perspective (<xref rid="bibr37-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Shields, 2008</xref>) in delineating the cross-cutting influence of gender for risk factors surrounding ASRH. This is important because differences in individual&#x02019;s control over resources and power are often embedded within social identities such as gender, age, and ethnicity (<xref rid="bibr37-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Shields, 2008</xref>). These power dynamics can generate unfair or negative beliefs, attitudes, and values surrounding sexual behavior.</p><p>Our findings also underscore the enormous impact of negative cultural beliefs, norms, and customs on adolescents&#x02019; SRB. Their views indicate that some existing customs and beliefs such as early marriages infringe on adolescents&#x02019; rights and freedom while others practices during events like burial ceremonies predispose them to high-risk experiences. These experiences concur with findings from other parts of Kenya (<xref rid="bibr16-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Juma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Njue et al., 2009</xref>), as well as SSA (<xref rid="bibr7-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Boyden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Wadesango et al., 2011</xref>), where such practices have been linked to poor health and social livelihood. Thus, ASRH interventions need to consider the specific socio-cultural dynamics that impact adolescents&#x02019; sexual health.</p><p>Concerning protective factors, few opportunities were discussed by participants and this may reflect the poor state of ASRH services in this region or a general lack of awareness of available services and structures for ASRH. Nonetheless, some participants acknowledged the existence of certain protective factors, especially school-based ASRH services and structures like teen clubs, guidance and counseling teachers, and functional school regulations. Indeed, school attendance has been attributed with large protective effects for early sexual debut among Kenyan adolescents (<xref rid="bibr13-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Handa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr19-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">KNBS and ICF International, 2014</xref>), which emphasizes the need to enable school attendance and strengthen existing school structures by incorporating opportunities for ASRH promotion. There is a need to identify and strengthen both formal and informal systems that can be protective and promotive factors for ASRH in our context and similar contexts.</p><p>Besides, much as ASRH services are not yet comprehensive or adolescent-friendly (<xref rid="bibr27-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">NCAPD et al., 2011</xref>), access to some form of ASRH services remains an important protective factor. These findings indicate that there is a mix of private, non-profit organization, and public service providers offering a range of ASRH services like short- and long-term contraception methods. While some of these services are free or subsidized for adolescents, more needs to be done in making the relevant ASRH services more usable, accessible, and affordable for adolescents. These are also major issues that adolescents grapple with from other parts of SSA and the rest of the world and have been earmarked for much-needed intervention (<xref rid="bibr2-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Bearinger et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>These findings highlight the perceived importance of legal or punitive action for sexual offenders in handling and addressing sexual violence and injustices against adolescents in Kilifi. Indeed, the Kenyan laws on sexual offenses have been recently amended (<xref rid="bibr28-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">National Council for Law Reporting (NCLR), 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Ndungu, 2007</xref>) to extensively define sexual violence beyond mere focus on morality. New themes that had not been clearly addressed in the older laws include criminalization of sexual harassment, child sex tourism, child pornography, gang rape, incest, and child prostitution (<xref rid="bibr28-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">NCLR, 2014</xref>). There are also provisions for the protection of vulnerable witnesses, entitlement of both victims and perpetrators to treatment and professional counseling, and long-term supervision of dangerous sexual offenders after serving their prison sentences (<xref rid="bibr28-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">NCLR, 2014</xref>). Notwithstanding, sexual crime is still problematic in Kilifi (<xref rid="bibr28-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">NCRC, 2014</xref>), and this may partly be tied to not only low levels of awareness by the public about their rights and existing laws on sexual crime but also low levels of awareness by key stakeholders such as police and public administrators who are in charge of implementing these laws (<xref rid="bibr30-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Ndungu, 2007</xref>). Overall, while evidence surrounding the effectiveness of legal action for sexual perpetrators remains scanty, especially in the SSA context, restorative justice or human rights approaches for handling sex offenders are clearly important (<xref rid="bibr21-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">McAlinden, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-1359105317736783" ref-type="bibr">Ward et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Overall, this study has several strengths. Our participants were a diverse mix of adolescent sub-groups, that is, primary and secondary school adolescents, those who had dropped out of school and adolescents living with HIV. They were also recruited with a representation of both rural and peri-urban settings in Kilifi County. In addition, findings were triangulated across the different methods used to consider those from FGDs and key informants. At the same time, in interpreting our findings, it is important to take account of limitations for this study. First, the views shared by our participants may be specific to adolescents living in Kilifi at the Kenyan coast. Although similar views about SRB may be shared from other geographical contexts, we are not in position to ascertain the relevance of these findings to other groups or populations. Additionally, as for qualitative methods in general, data collection, analysis, and interpretation are subject to individual influence; we have countered this effect through maintaining reflexivity and ensuring the active contribution of a multi-disciplinary research team in all stages of this research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section40-1359105317736783"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, our findings stress that SRB is a significant problem among adolescents at the Kenyan coast. Many of our findings highlight the generalizability of risk factors that have been documented in studies in other regions of Kenya and beyond, particularly the gendered nature of such risks. However, novel risk factors in the Kenyan coastal context include the following: the negative impact of the tourism industry on adolescents&#x02019; sexual behavior, the severe implications of family poverty such as engagement of adolescent girls in risky commercial activities, and the negative consequences of certain customary events like funeral ceremonies. Moreover, these factors coexist or interplay across different ecological levels. Important measures to counter SRB in this and similar contexts are likely to include the following: useful and accessible ASRH services for adolescents; improved safety within the adolescents&#x02019; neighborhood, home, and school environments; responsible parenting; tackling oppressive and potentially harmful cultural norms and customs; ensuring that legal and other regulatory processes are recognized and enacted in these settings; and addressing poverty within households. Gender inequality remains a major concern that should be explored and addressed with special attention to the intersectionality of its aspects across ecological domains. Opportunities for improving ASRH exist. First, many Kenyan adolescents are school goers and thus could be accessed with a range of ASRH services through the education system. Second, a presence of diverse private, public, and civil society service providers in the region presents existing platforms for resource mobilization and through which improvement in access plus quality of ASRH can be realized. Third, a comprehensive legal framework and national guidelines for management of sexual violence in Kenya exist and thus need more public awareness and more effective implementation. To this end, intervention research should focus on delineating effective program and policy action to tackle these drivers of adolescent SRB at different ecological levels in Kilifi and other geographical settings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all the participants who took part in this study.
