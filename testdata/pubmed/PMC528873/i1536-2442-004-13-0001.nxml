It has been argued that because of the high nutritional quality of its foliage, <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> might facilitate leafhopper invasion of native Hawaiian ecosystems that were originally dominated by the endemic tree <named-content content-type="genus-species">Metrosideros polymorpha</named-content> (Gaudichaud). In the present study, we quantified suitability of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> as ovipositional hosts for <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. rufofascia</named-content>. Overall, leafhoppers preferred to deposit their eggs into the foliage of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content>. <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> presence in the area did not affect leafhopper oviposition on <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content>. Foliar pubescence provided good protection of hirsute morphotypes of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content>. At the same time, glabrous <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> morphotypes were quite suitable for leafhopper oviposition. There was no difference in the abundance of leafhopper eggs along a precipitation gradient. Our results confirm that invasion of native Hawaiian forests by the weed <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> will facilitate their invasion by <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. rufofascia</named-content>. Because of the broad host range characteristic of the two-spotted leafhopper, this build-up may adversely affect a number of endemic plant species growing in native forests.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><named-content content-type="genus-species">Sophonia rufofascia</named-content></kwd><kwd><named-content content-type="genus-species">Myrica faya</named-content></kwd><kwd><named-content content-type="genus-species">Metrosideros polymorpha</named-content></kwd><kwd>biological invasion</kwd><kwd>exotic species</kwd><kwd>oviposition</kwd><kwd>biotic facilitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The two-spotted leafhopper, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Sophonia rufofascia</named-content> (Kuoh and Kuoh), originally described from southern China (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-kuoh1" ref-type="bibr">Kouh and Kouh 1983</xref>), was first discovered on Oahu in 1987 (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-heu1" ref-type="bibr">Heu and Kumashiro 1989</xref>). Since then, it has spread to all of the major Hawaiian islands, where it has been reported to attack over 300 plant species in 83 families (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-fukada1" ref-type="bibr">Fukada 1996</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-alyokhin1" ref-type="bibr">Alyokhin <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). Leafhopper feeding and oviposition cause plant vascular bundle abnormalities, resulting in interveinal chlorosis, vein browning, retarded development of new growth, and even death of affected plants (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-jones2" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). In commercial guava, leafhopper injury reduces yields by &#x02248;23&#x00025; compared to pesticide-protected trees (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-jones1" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). Being a highly polyphagous insect, the two-spotted leafhopper poses a threat both to agricultural production and to natural habitat conservation in Hawaii. Among its recorded host plant species, 68&#x00025; are economically important fruit, vegetable, and ornamental crops; and 22&#x00025; are endemic to the Hawaiian islands, including 14 rare and endangered species (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-fukada1" ref-type="bibr">Fukada 1996</xref>). Two-spotted leafhopper damage has been implicated as a cause of severe dieback of several native Hawaiian plants, such as ohia-lehua tree <named-content content-type="genus-species">Metrosideros polymorpha</named-content> (Gaudichaud) and uluhe fern <named-content content-type="genus-species">Dicranopteris linearis</named-content> Underwood (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-palmer1" ref-type="bibr">Palmer 1993</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-lenz1" ref-type="bibr">Lenz 2000</xref>). However, while proving that <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. rufofascia</named-content> feeding is indeed detrimental to <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. linearis</named-content> fern, <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-jones2" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref> failed to find a significant correlation between leafhopper presence and extensive uluhe death in natural habitats. Similarly, <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-alyokhin1" ref-type="bibr">Alyokhin <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> observed wide spread symptoms of leafhopper damage but no significant dieback of surveyed plants. Nevertheless, the two-spotted leafhopper remains an important pest in Hawaii, applying a substantial stress on native and economically important vegetation (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-lenz1" ref-type="bibr">Lenz 2000</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-lenz2" ref-type="bibr">Lenz and Taylor 2001</xref>).</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> is the endemic tree that used to dominate a wide variety of Hawaiian ecosystems (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-walker1" ref-type="bibr">Walker and Vitousek 1991</xref>). It occurs over a wide ecological range from coast to high-elevation montane habitats, from desert to wet rainfall regions, and from recent lava flows to old, deeply weathered soils (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-drake1" ref-type="bibr">Drake and Mueller-Dombois 1993</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-kitayama1" ref-type="bibr">Kitayama and Mueller-Dombois 1995</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-kitayama3" ref-type="bibr">Kitayama <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). Not surprisingly, this plant displays a high degree of morphological variation, with foliar pubescence being one of the major distinguishing characteristics among infraspecific varieties (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-kitayama3" ref-type="bibr">Kitayama <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). This variation is clinal along elevational and rainfall gradients (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-corn1" ref-type="bibr">Corn and Hiesey 1973</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-kitayama3" ref-type="bibr">Kitayama <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). Hirsute trees are presumably better adapted to harsh environmental conditions that makes them the more abundant morphotype at higher elevations and in areas prone to drought. For the same reason, they are also predominant in pioneering situations, such as on young lava flows and in disturbed areas along roadsides. Hirsute morphotypes in such places are gradually replaced by glabrous morphotypes, similar to pioneer plant species being replaced by later successional plant species in more floristically diverse continental regions (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-stemmermann1" ref-type="bibr">Stemmermann 1983</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-mueller-dombois1" ref-type="bibr">Mueller-Dombois 1983</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-kitayama1" ref-type="bibr">Kitayama <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-kitayama3" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>).</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> Aiton is an evergreen broad-leafed tree that is listed among the 12 most noxious weeds in the state of Hawaii (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-smith1" ref-type="bibr">Smith 1985</xref>). <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> forms monotypic stands that replace and exclude native vegetation, particularly <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content>. In addition to direct competition with native plants, <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> also alters ecosystem-level processes indirectly through association with a nitrogen-fixing actinorhizal symbiont (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-vitousek1" ref-type="bibr">Vitousek <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-vitousek2" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). By increasing the nitrogen content of Hawaiian soils, it facilitates invasion by a broader range of exotic plant species, which are otherwise inadequately adapted to compete with endemic vegetation on nitrogen-poor volcanic soils (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-gerrish1" ref-type="bibr">Gerrish and Mueller-Dombois 1980</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-vitousek1" ref-type="bibr">Vitousek <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-vitousek3" ref-type="bibr">Vitousek and Walker 1989</xref>). Furthermore, high nitrogen content in its foliage may favor development of herbivorous insect populations (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-mattson1" ref-type="bibr">Mattson 1980</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-louda1" ref-type="bibr">Louda and Collinge 1992</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-lenz2" ref-type="bibr">Lenz and Taylor 2001</xref>).</p><p>An increase in leafhopper abundance on <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> may result in their subsequent dispersal to other plant species in an area. Therefore, competitive stresses imposed on native vegetation by <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> invasion might be further aggravated by increased leafhopper herbivory. In a recent survey conducted in Hawaii Volcano National Park, <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-lenz2" ref-type="bibr">Lenz and Taylor (2001)</xref> captured up to 20 times more two-spotted leafhopper adults on traps hung on native plant species within sites invaded by <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> than in sites where this weed was removed as a part of an ecosystem preservation effort. However, two-spotted leafhopper adults are highly mobile. Therefore, it was not clear if the observed increase in captures was due to the movement of adults that had completed their development on <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content>, to the establishment of higher leafhopper populations on native vegetation, or to the combination of these factors.</p><p>Unlike <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> leaves, <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> leaves are never pubescent. Foliar pubescence is known to present a physical barrier to leafhopper colonization (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-johnson1" ref-type="bibr">Johnson 1975</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-tingey1" ref-type="bibr">Tingey 1985</xref>). Furthermore, in <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> pubescence is associated with a thicker cuticle layer (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-kitayama3" ref-type="bibr">Kitayama <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>), which can provide an additional challenge for both proboscis (especially in younger instars) and ovipositor penetration. <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-lee1" ref-type="bibr">Lee (1981)</xref> observed lower levels of herbivory on hirsute vs. glabrous trees prior to the leafhopper invasion. <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-jones2" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref> pointed out that feeding damage caused by the two-spotted leafhopper was also more severe on glabrous morphotypes of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. linearis</named-content> when compared to hirsute morphotypes. However, they did not provide any data to quantify their observation. Nothing is known about effects of foliar pubescence on <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. rufofascia</named-content> oviposition. We hypothesized that two-spotted leafhopper eggs would be more abundant on <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> and glabrous morphotypes of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> than on hirsute morphotypes of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content>. As a result, <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> forests will be more prone to leafhopper invasion (1) in areas invaded by <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content>, and (2) during late successional stages dominated by glabrous <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> morphotypes. To test our hypothesis, we quantified the rates of egg infestation of leaves on the two trees in different habitats on the islands of Hawaii and Kauai.</p><p>The two-spotted leafhopper has been recorded from a wide variety of habitats (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-fukada1" ref-type="bibr">Fukada 1996</xref>). In the survey by <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-alyokhin1" ref-type="bibr">Alyokhin <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref>, leafhoppers appeared to have a preference for wetter, closed habitats rather than drier, open ones. However, the occurrence of different plant species in their survey was itself habitat-dependent. Therefore, it was not clear if the observed difference could be attributed to the humidity itself. Plants suffering from water-stress have been shown to be more prone to attack by phytophagous insects (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-mattson2" ref-type="bibr">Mattson and Haack 1987</xref>), and leafhopper herbivory by itself increases the level of moisture stress in affected trees (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-lenz1" ref-type="bibr">Lenz 2000</xref>). Therefore, knowing effects of humidity on leafhopper distribution is important for a better understanding of the consequences of its invasion in different habitats.

Our results support the suggestion that damage caused by exotic pests often entails positive interactions, either one-way or two-way, among the introduced species (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-howarth1" ref-type="bibr">Howarth 1985</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-simberloff1" ref-type="bibr">Simberloff and Von Holle 1999</xref>). Indeed, in their recent review of the published literature, <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-simberloff1" ref-type="bibr">Simberloff and Von Holle (1999)</xref> reported that of 190 pairwise interactions between the alien species tested, 82&#x00025; consisted of &#x0002b;/&#x02013; interactions similar to the one described in the present study, 5.3&#x00025; consisted of &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; interactions, and only 6.3&#x00025; consisted of mutually negative &#x02212;/&#x02013; interactions.</p><p>Oviposition preference of the leafhoppers was strongly influenced by the presence of foliar pubescence on <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> trees. In all habitats where <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> trees were mostly hirsute, the number of leafhopper eggs was lower on the endemic tree than on <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content>.

Therefore, we suggest that increased captures of adult leafhoppers on <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> trees in the areas invaded by <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-lenz2" ref-type="bibr">Lenz and Taylor 2001</xref>) probably indicate a general build-up of the leafhopper populations in those areas, not their increase specifically on <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> trees. In other words, the invasive plant provided a reservoir for the pest to build up upon, but its direct association with the native plant did not appear to be particularly important.</p><p>The glabrous morphotype of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> was more suitable for leafhopper oviposition than the hirsute morphotype. All <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> trees surveyed on the island of Kauai lacked foliar pubescence. Accordingly, their infestation with leafhopper eggs was comparable to that of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> at two of the Kauai sites. At the remaining two Kauai sites, <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> harbored fewer eggs than <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content>, possibly because the high nitrogen content of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> foliage favored leafhopper development under particular local conditions (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-mattson1" ref-type="bibr">Mattson 1980</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-louda1" ref-type="bibr">Louda and Collinge 1992</xref>). However, the difference was far less dramatic than at the hirsute morphotype-dominated sites surveyed on the island of Hawaii. When growing within the same geographic area, hirsute morphotypes of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> harbored 30 times less eggs than glabrous morphotypes. Also, visible symptoms of leafhopper damage (chlorosis, vein browning) were always more severe on the glabrous trees (Alyokhin, unpublished data). This confirms anecdotal observations of <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-jones2" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref>, who reported higher levels of leafhopper damage to the glabrous morphotypes of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. linearis</named-content> when compared to the hirsute morphotypes of the same species.</p><p>Foliar trichomes create a mechanical barrier, limiting leafhopper access to the leaf surface, interfering with locomotion and attachment to a plant, and often causing death of entrapped individuals (<xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-broersma1" ref-type="bibr">Broersma <italic>et al.</italic> 1972</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-pillemer1" ref-type="bibr">Pillemer and Tingey 1976</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-tingey1" ref-type="bibr">Tingey 1985</xref>; <xref rid="i1536-2442-004-13-0001-elden1" ref-type="bibr">Elden and Elgin 1992</xref>). Therefore, it is not surprising that hirsute <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. polymorpha</named-content> made a poor ovipositional host for two-spotted leafhoppers. Its replacement by glabrous <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. faya</named-content> will result in build-up of leafhopper populations that are otherwise tolerant of dry conditions dominated by the hirsute morphotype. Because of the broad host range characteristic of the two-spotted leafhopper, this build-up may adversely affect a number of endemic plant species growing in native forests.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Jonavee Lim and Roxanne Cumming for technical assistance.
