Activation of NRF2 has chemopreventive effects in cancer and exerts beneficial effects in a number of diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory diseases, hepatosteatosis, obesity and insulin resistance. Hence, there have been great efforts to discover and characterize novel NRF2 activators. One reported NRF2 activator is the labdane diterpenoid andrographolide. In this study, we identified the mechanism through which andrographolide activates NRF2. We showed that andrographolide inhibits the function of KEAP1, a protein that together with CUL3 and RBX1 forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase that polyubiquitinates NRF2. Andrographolide partially inhibits the interaction of KEAP1 with CUL3 in a manner dependent on Cys151 in KEAP1. This suggests that andrographolide forms Michael acceptor dependent adducts with Cys151 in KEAP1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, leading to inhibition of NRF2 ubiquitination and consequently accumulation of the transcription factor. Interestingly, we also showed that at higher concentrations andrographolide increases NRF2 protein expression in a Cys151 independent, but likely KEAP1 dependent manner, possibly through modification of other Cys residues in KEAP1. In this study we also screened secondary metabolites produced by endophytes isolated from non-flowering plants for NRF2-inducing properties. One of the extracts, ORX 41, increased both NRF2 protein expression and transcriptional activity markedly. These results suggest that endophytes isolated from non-flowering or other plants may be a good source of novel NRF2 inducing compounds.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant extracts are known to have anti-inflammatory properties and are widely used in traditional medicine. Andrographolide, a labdane diterpenoid, was isolated from the popular medicinal plant <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic>. This herb has long been used as traditional medicine in Asian countries for the treatment of the common cold, sore throat, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, diarrhea and inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Andrographolide contains a Michael acceptor group. The carbon in the &#x003b2;-position from the carbonyl moiety of the Michael acceptor group can form a covalent bond with the thiolate group of reactive cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204853.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

The &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; carbons of the Michael acceptor group are indicated. (B) HEK293T cells were treated with increasing andrographolide concentrations, as indicated, for 4 hours. DMSO was added as a negative control and the Cullin E3 RING ligase (CRL) inhibitor MLN4924 (1 &#x003bc;M) served as positive control. Cells were lysed and cell lysates analyzed by Western blotting using NRF2 and actin antibodies. (C) To measure the time dependence of andrographolide dependent NRF2 activation, HEK293T cells were treated with 7.5 &#x003bc;M andrographolide or 1 &#x003bc;M MLN4924 for the indicated times. Subsequently, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. The CRL substrate p27<sup>Kip1</sup> served as a positive control for the CRL inhibitor MLN4924. (D) To measure Nrf2 transcriptional activity, the ARE luciferase reporter assay was performed as described under Materials and Methods. The cells were transfected for 24 hours before treatment with andrographolide (7.5 &#x003bc;M) or sulforaphane (10 &#x003bc;M) for 6 hours. The results shown are representative of two independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0204853.g001"/></fig><p>Apart from the regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, it has been reported in a number of studies that andrographolide also functions as an activator of the NF-E2 Related Factor-2 (NRF2) [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. NRF2 is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that regulates the expression of phase I drug metabolizing enzymes and antioxidant proteins. Drugs that activate NRF2 are studied for the treatment of diseases that are associated with oxidative stress, such as neurodegenerative diseases. NRF2 activators are also considered as chemopreventive agents in cancer. Thus, by activating NRF2, andrographolide exerts cytoprotective effects.</p><p>It was recently reported that andrographolide upregulates NRF2 in a manner dependent on p38 MAPK and ERK activation [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204853.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Andrographolide has also been reported to from adducts with Cys77, Cys151, Cys273 and Cys368 in KEAP1 [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The KEAP1 protein is the major negative regulator of NRF2. KEAP1 is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that also contains the scaffold protein Cullin 3 (CUL3) and the RING domain containing protein RBX1 [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this complex, KEAP1 functions as a substrate recognition subunit. KEAP1 binds via its double-glycine repeat (DGR) domain to the NRF2 substrate and via its &#x02018;&#x02018;Bric a brac, Tramtrack and Broad Complex/Pox virus and Zinc finger&#x0201d; (BTB/POZ) domain to the CUL3 scaffold. The RBX1 subunit recruits ubiquitin charged E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes to facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin onto lysine residues in NRF2. Various NRF2 activating drugs function by forming adducts with cysteine residues in KEAP1. One major cysteine that is modified by a number of NRF2 activating compounds, such as sulforaphane and the tripertinoid CDDO-Me, is Cys151. It has been reported that modification of Cys151 by these compounds leads to the dissociation of KEAP1 from CUL3, thus preventing NRF2 ubiquitination [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Here we hypothesized that andrographolide could induce NRF2 by forming a covalent adduct with critical cysteine residues in KEAP1 [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], resulting in the inhibition of KEAP1-dependent NRF2 degradation. We found that the induction of NRF2 by andrographolide is dependent on the presence of Cysteine 151 in KEAP1, strongly implicating this residue as the major molecular target of andrographolide. Andrographolide induced KEAP1 modification at Cys151 leads to partial dissociation of KEAP1 from CUL3, thus inhibiting NRF2 ubiquitination and degradation, and ultimately leading to the induction of the phase 2 response. Of note, at higher concentrations, andrographolide also induces NRF2 protein expression in a Cys151 independent manner.</p><p>NRF2 can also be induced by various other plant derived compounds [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Such bioactive metabolites may either be produced by the plants themselves or by endophytes living within the plant tissues [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, secondary metabolites produced by endophytes isolated from non-flowering plants were screened for Nrf2-inducing properties. We focussed specifically on non-flowering medicinal plants, particularly tropical ferns and mosses that are local to Singapore, given that these plants are less studied as endophyte reservoirs. Among the plants chosen were the tropical ferns <italic>Phlegmariurus phlegmaria</italic>, <italic>Taenitis blechnoides</italic>, <italic>Pyrrosia piloselloides</italic>, <italic>Psilotum nudum</italic>, <italic>Ophioglossum reticulatum</italic> and <italic>Dicranopteris linearis</italic> as well as the mosses <italic>Calymperes erosum</italic>, <italic>Campylopus serratus</italic>, <italic>Philonotis thwaitesii</italic> and <italic>Vesicularia dubyana</italic>. Given that a number of these plants have been implicated to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, we hypothesized that the fungal and bacterial endophytes living within these plants may also produce secondary bioactive metabolites with NRF2 inducing properties. Notably, the extract ORX 41 showed a marked increase in NRF2 protein expression and transcriptional activity compared to the vehicle control. Further studies are needed to identify the exact component within this crude organic extract that accounts for the NRF2 inducing properties. The findings from this study have important implications for the understanding of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of andrographolide as well as the identification of novel plant derived NRF2 inducing compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Collection of tropical ferns and mosses</title><p>The tropical ferns (<italic>Dicranopteris linearis</italic>, <italic>Ophioglossum reticulatum</italic>, <italic>Psilotum nudum</italic>, <italic>Pyrrosia piloselloides</italic> and <italic>Taenitis blechnoides</italic>) and mosses (<italic>Calymperes erosum</italic>, <italic>Campylopus serratus</italic>, <italic>Philonotis thwaitesii</italic> and <italic>Vesicularia dubyana</italic>) were collected within the National University of Singapore (NUS) Kent Ridge campus (1&#x000b0; 17' 48.2" N, 103&#x000b0; 46' 34.7" E).

We also showed that the effect of low andrographolide concentrations is dependent on Cys151 in KEAP1. Similar to other compounds that act via Cys151, andrographolide may function by disrupting the interaction between KEAP1 and CUL3. We have also shown that at higher concentrations, andrographolide acts via a mechanism independent of Cys151 in KEAP1. The effect of high andrographolide concentrations may be due to the interaction of the drug with other cysteine residues in KEAP1. Alternatively, andrographolide may potentially induce NRF2 protein expression in a KEAP1 independent manner.</p><p>In previous studies, Yen et al., 2016 and Wong et al., 2016 found that induction of the NRF2 protein and the NRF2 transcriptional target HO-1 by andrographolide is partially prevented by treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. A similar, though less pronounced inhibitory effect NRF2 protein expression and HO-1 mRNA expression was observed with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In these two studies, the authors used andrographolide concentrations of 10 &#x003bc;M and 30 &#x003bc;M, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204853.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These concentrations are similar to the low concentration of 7.5 &#x003bc;M used in our study. The reasons for the discrepant results are currently unclear. However, it is important to note that the previous studies observed that the p38 and ERK inhibitors blocked the andrographolide dependent increase in NRF2 protein expression only partially. In contrast, we have shown that mutating Cys151 in Keap1 completely prevents the effect of 7.5 &#x003bc;M andrographolide. One caveat is that in our studies we relied on overexpressed proteins, as it was necessary to exogenously introduce the C151S KEAP1 mutant into cells. Nonetheless, in support of a Cys151 dependent mechanism of action of andrographolide, Yuan et al., 2012 have reported that andrographolide can indeed form an adduct with Cys151 of recombinant KEAP1 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>What is the mechanism through which compounds that interact with KEAP1 lead to inhibition of NRF2 ubiquitination? Various NRF2 stabilizing compounds form adducts with Cys151 in KEAP1. Cys151 localises to the KEAP1 BTB domain, which mediates KEAP1 homodimerization as well as binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase scaffold protein CUL3. It has been suggested that drugs that bind to Cys151 lead to a dissociation of CUL3 from the KEAP1 substrate receptor [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On the other hand, it has also been shown that NRF2 stabilization by Cys151 dependent NRF2 inducers can occur in the absence if CUL3-KEAP1 dissociation and is accompanied by a conformational change in the KEAP1 protein [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Of note, our results indicate that mediating binding to CUL3 is unlikely to be the only function of the KEAP1 BTB domain. Thus, when we substituted the Keap1 BTB domain with that of a different CUL3 substrate receptor protein (KLHL12), BTB homodimerization and binding to CUL3 were preserved, but NRF2 degradation was prevented. This confirms that the BTB domain also exerts conformational control over the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which may be disrupted by Cys151 interacting drugs [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In addition to Cys151, Yuan et al., 2012 have also shown that andrographolide reacts with Cys77, Cys273 and Cys368 residues in KEAP1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. This suggests that andrographolide can potentially inhibit KEAP1 function through the interaction with other cysteine residues. We indeed observed that at a high concentration of 100 &#x003bc;M, andrographolide induces NRF2 protein expression in a Cys151 independent manner. At this concentration, andrographolide increased the binding of both wild type and C151S mutant KEAP1 to CUL3, suggesting that the effect of andrographolide at this concentration is mediated through Keap1 as well. Of note, other NRF2 inducers that stabilize the transcription factor in a Cys151 independent manner, e.g. arsenite, monomethylarsonous, PMX290 and nitro-fatty acids, have also been reported to cause an increase in the interaction between KEAP1 and CUL3 [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204853.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204853.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is likely that these NRF2 inducers cause a conformational change in KEAP1 that is accompanied by an increased interaction between KEAP1 and CUL3. However, whether the increased KEAP1-CUL3 binding is functionally significant is currently not clear. Further elucidation of the underlying mechanism will improve our understanding of Keap1 function and may aid future drug design for chemopreventive and therapeutic purposes.</p><p>To identify novel NRF2 activating compounds, we also isolated endophytes from non-flowering plants local to Singapore and tested whether the endophytes produce bioactive metabolites with NRF2 inducing properties. We focussed on tropical ferns and mosses, some of which have been traditionally used in many countries in Asia as traditional medicine remedies to treat various conditions. Examples include the use of <italic>Phlegmariurus phlegmaria (</italic>also known as &#x02018;coarse tassel fern&#x02019;) applied to wounds in the form of a paste [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or the use of <italic>Taenitis blechnoides</italic> as medicine for post-natal women in native tribes in Malaysia and in India [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204853.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Apart from these non-flowering plants, <italic>Psilotum nudum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204853.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and <italic>Dicranopteris linearis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] have also been suggested to have antioxidant properties. Thus, given that non-flowering plants have been implicated to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, we hypothesized that the fungal and bacterial endophytes living within these plants may also produce secondary bioactive metabolites with NRF2 inducing properties.</p><p>Our results show that among the organic extracts isolated from the bacterial and fungal endophytes, ORX 41 is the most promising extract as it showed significant NRF2-inducing properties. ORX 41 is the dichloromethane extract of a <italic>Phomopsis</italic> sp., a fungal endophyte isolated from the lamina of <italic>Dicranopteris linearis</italic>. Interestingly, a recent study reported that the acetonitrile extract of the fungal endophyte <italic>Phomopsis</italic> sp.Cs-c2 from <italic>Senna spectabilis</italic> (DC.) contains a number of compounds, cytochalasin H, cytochalasin J and alternariol, with anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="pone.0204853.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The compounds were shown to inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species by stimulated neutrophils. It would be interesting to test whether these compounds are present in our dichloromethane extract and whether the compounds have NRF2 inducing properties.</p><p>Hence, we conclude that ORX 41 has the greatest potential in inducing NRF2. Further studies are needed to identify the exact component within this crude organic extract that accounts for its NRF2 inducing properties. The identification and characterization of the NRF2 inducing compound within the organic extract ORX 41 could lead to the discovery of a novel NRF2 inducer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204853.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Western blot analysis of NRF2 protein concentrations in HEK293T cells after treatment with andrographolide and arsenite.</title><p>(A, B) HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-NRF2 and either wild type FLAG-KEAP1 or C151S mutant FLAG-KEAP1 for 2 days before treatment with andrographolide (7.5 &#x003bc;M) and arsenite (20 &#x003bc;M) for 6 hours.
