The types of fish and shellfish and fermentation process used in its production depend on the region from which it derives. Variations in ingredients and fermentation procedures yield end products with different smells, tastes, and colors. For this data article, we employed an electronic panel (e-panel) technique including an electronic nose (e-nose), electronic tongue (e-tongue), and electronic eye (e-eye), in which smell, taste, and color are evaluated by sensors instead of the human nose, tongue, and eye to avoid subjective error. The presented data comprise clustering of 46 commercially available fish sauce products based separate e-nose, e-tongue, and e-eye test results. Sensory intensity data from the e-nose, e-tongue, and e-eye were separately classified by cluster analysis and are shown in dendrograms. The hierarchical cluster analysis indicates major three groups on e-nose and e-tongue data, and major four groups on e-eye data.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0005"><bold>Specifications Table</bold><table-wrap id="t0010" position="float"><alt-text id="at0025">Table</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Subject area</td><td>Food science</td></tr><tr><td>More specific subject area</td><td>Food quality assessment using electronic sensor technology</td></tr><tr><td>Type of data</td><td>Table and dendrograms</td></tr><tr><td>How data was acquired</td><td>Each fish sauce product was tested with an e-nose (&#x003b1;FOX 4000, Alpha M.O.S., Toulouse, France), e-tongue (ASTREE, Alpha M.O.S.), and e-eye (IRIS VA300, Alpha M.O.S.), and the resulting data subjected to cluster analysis using R software.</td></tr><tr><td>Data format</td><td>Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>Experimental factors</td><td>The fish sauce products used were made by various companies in Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, China, the Philippines, and Italy.</td></tr><tr><td>Experimental features</td><td>The smells, tastes, and colors of commercially available fish sauce products were assessed by e-nose, e-tongue, and e-eye analysis.</td></tr><tr><td>Data source location</td><td>Tokyo, Fukuoka, and Abashiri, Japan</td></tr><tr><td>Data accessibility</td><td>Data are presented in this article</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0010"><bold>Value of the data</bold><list list-type="simple" id="li0005"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">The availability of these data will enable a discussion of the influence of factors such as raw materials and the production process on smell, taste, and color development during fish sauce product manufacture.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">The data presented will allow estimation of fish sauce product consumer preferences in different countries.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">The smell, taste, and color data provided will be useful for culinary applications and the development of fish sauce products.</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Data</title><p id="p0030">Fish sauce is produced from seafood of various types. <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> displays the geographic origins and ingredients of the commercially available fish sauce products analyzed. Anchovy and sardine appear to be widely used in fish sauce production in Thailand and featured in fish sauce products from Vietnam, China, and Italy. A fish sauce product from the Philippines contained mackerel. Flying fish, which is often used as <italic>dashi</italic>, a broth employed in various dishes in Japan (especially in the <italic>Kyushu</italic> area), was found in several Japanese fish sauce products. Bonito is also employed for <italic>dashi</italic> preparation throughout Japan, and was also present in many of the fish sauce products tested from this country. In addition, Japanese sandfish, tuna, cod, sea bream, cutlassfish, deep-sea smelt, sea urchin, oyster, shrimp, and squid were found to be used in the manufacture of fish sauce products in Japan. Commercial fish sauce products from Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, China, the Philippines, and Italy clustered into three major groups when the e-nose data were analyzed (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Cluster analysis of the e-tongue data also identified three groups (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), whereas that of the e-eye data yielded four major groups (<xref rid="f0015"

id="p0035">Fish sauce possesses distinctive smells, tastes and colors depending on the ingredient fish, fermentation process, geographic origins. Here we analyzed these features of fish sauces from Asian countries as well as Italian products. To avoid the effects of subjective assessment, we used an e-nose, e-tongue, and e-eye to precisely analyze the smell, taste, and color of fish sauce products from several countries. The e-nose and e-tongue consist of arrays of non-selective gas and liquid sensors with broad and partially overlapping selectivity towards the compounds present in a sample <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In addition, an e-eye was used to distinguish color components using camera-equipped apparatus and computer-assisted analysis. Of the commercial fish sauce products selected, 30 were produced in Japan, 11 were from Thailand, two derived from Vietnam, and one was from each of China, the Philippines, and Italy (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The list of numerical data indicating signal intensities on e-nose, e-tongue and e-eye sensors was brought to hierarchical cluster analysis to classify the fish sauces based on their smell, taste and color.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>3</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0025"><label>3.1</label><title>Materials</title><p id="p0040">All of the 46 fish sauce products were purchased at local markets in Tokyo, Fukuoka, and Abashiri (Japan).
