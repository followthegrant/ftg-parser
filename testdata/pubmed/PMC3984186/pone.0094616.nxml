The underlying mechanism by which IPF fibroblasts become desensitized to polymerized collagen, thereby eluding collagen matrix-induced cell death has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that the pathologically altered PTEN/Akt axis suppresses autophagy via high mTOR kinase activity, which subsequently desensitizes IPF fibroblasts to collagen matrix induced cell death. We found that the autophagosome marker LC3-2 expression is suppressed, while mTOR activity remains high when IPF fibroblasts are cultured on collagen. However, LC3-2 expression increased in response to IPF fibroblast attachment to collagen in the presence of rapamycin. In addition, PTEN over-expression or Akt inhibition suppressed mTOR activity, thereby increasing LC3-2 expression in IPF fibroblasts. Furthermore, the treatment of IPF fibroblasts over-expressing PTEN or dominant negative Akt with autophagy inhibitors increased IPF fibroblast cell death. Enhanced p-mTOR expression along with low LC3-2 expression was also found in myofibroblasts within the fibroblastic foci from IPF patients. Our data show that the aberrant PTEN/Akt/mTOR axis desensitizes IPF fibroblasts from polymerized collagen driven stress by suppressing autophagic activity, which produces a viable IPF fibroblast phenotype on collagen. This suggests that the aberrantly regulated autophagic pathway may play an important role in maintaining a pathological IPF fibroblast phenotype in response to collagen rich environment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Pulmonary Fibrosis Research Grant from the American Lung Association, Scientist Development Grant from the American Heart Association NIH R01 HL114662-01A1.

The lysosomal system is responsible for degrading macromolecules, including proteins, and for the turnover of cytoplasmic organelles by autophagy <xref rid="pone.0094616-Yunying1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094616-Eskelinen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The autophagic pathway consists of several distinct steps, resulting in the sequestration of cellular cargo such as damaged organelles, protein aggregates, or pathogens by the double-membraned autophagosomes <xref rid="pone.0094616-Mizushima1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094616-Mehrpour1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The beneficial roles of autophagy are associated with the homeostatic turnover of damaged cellular organelles and proteins <xref rid="pone.0094616-Engelender1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094616-Beau1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, it has been well established that deregulated autophagy is associated with several human diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory bowel diseases <xref rid="pone.0094616-Beau1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094616-White1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Prior studies have shown that stress inducing conditions such as ER stress, oxidative stress, or elevated ROS formation can promote the activation of autophagy <xref rid="pone.0094616-Kincaid1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and that lung injury caused by hyperoxia, cigarette smoke, or toxins is thought to be the initial step toward autophagy in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis <xref rid="pone.0094616-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094616-Ryter1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These studies further suggest that autophagy may be an important mechanism that represents an inducible response to stress in lung cells <xref rid="pone.0094616-Ryter2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094616-Ryter3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Therefore, the current concept of the role of autophagy is that when cells are exposed to a stressful environment, autophagy is initially activated to protect the cells from these conditions until it reaches its threshold.</p><p>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibroproliferative lung disease of unknown cause. IPF is characterized by the accumulation of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and aberrant remodeling of the lung architecture by excessive production of type I collagen rich matrix <xref rid="pone.0094616-Kuhn1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094616-KuhnIII1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094616-Yamashita1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Myofibroblasts are the main cell type that is responsible for this excessive production of extracellular matrix within fibroblastic foci that are characteristic of the fibrotic process. When normal lung fibroblasts attach to polymerized collagen, the PI3K/Akt pathway is suppressed by high PTEN activity, thereby inhibiting fibroblast proliferation and promoting apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0094616-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094616-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In contrast, when IPF fibroblasts attach to polymerized collagen, they exhibit high Akt activity due to PTEN suppression, thereby producing highly proliferative and anti-apoptotic phenotypes on collagen matrix <xref rid="pone.0094616-Xia2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094616-Nho1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Immunohistochemical analysis of IPF fibroblasts within the fibroblastic foci of IPF patient specimens also revealed that PTEN expression is suppressed while Akt activity is up-regulated <xref rid="pone.0094616-Xia3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Furthermore, prior studies have shown that autophagy is not activated in IPF fibroblasts, suggesting a possibility of a direct link between the deregulation of autophagy and the fibrotic process <xref rid="pone.0094616-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094616-Ricci1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We recently found that when IPF fibroblasts are cultured on polymerized collagen, autophagy is low, while normal lung fibroblast attachment to collagen increases autophagy induction. This finding suggests that normal lung fibroblasts sense polymerized collagen as a stress inducing environment while IPF fibroblasts have a pathologically altered mechanism to desensitize themselves to the stress inducing environment of polymerized collagen. Since Akt is an important kinase involved in negative regulation of autophagy via mTOR <xref rid="pone.0094616-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094616-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094616-Nav1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, these data further suggest that the aberrant PTEN/Akt axis in IPF fibroblasts suppresses autophagy induction, thereby maintaining the pathological IPF fibroblast phenotype on polymerized collagen. Therefore, our goal is to verify whether aberrant autophagic activity desensitizes IPF fibroblasts to stress inducing environments and confers a cell death resistant IPF fibroblast phenotype on collagen rich matrix. We first examined autophagic activity by measuring the autophagosome marker, LC3-2 protein <xref rid="pone.0094616-Kabeya1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We found that when IPF fibroblasts were cultured on collagen matrix, LC3-2 expression was low. In contrast, LC3-2 expression in control fibroblasts was elevated when cultured on collagen matrix, suggesting that the induction of autophagy in IPF fibroblasts is suppressed under this condition. Furthermore, when PTEN was over-expressed or Akt/mTOR functions were inhibited, LC3-2 expression was increased in IPF fibroblasts. Moreover, when autophagic activity in IPF fibroblasts expressing either PTEN or dominant negative Akt was inhibited by autophagosome inhibitors 3-methyl adenine (3MA) and chloroquine (CQ), cell death was significantly increased. Finally, we found elevated p-mTOR expression while LC3-2 expression was low in cells within the fibroblastic foci of IPF patient lung specimens. These studies showed that IPF fibroblasts have acquired a desensitizing mechanism to respond to environmental stress such as polymerized collagen matrix by utilizing the PTEN/Akt/mTOR axis, and this pathologically altered autophagic pathway may be responsible for the IPF fibroblast's ability to maintain a viable phenotype on collagen rich matrix.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study involves the analysis of human IPF patient specimens. Primary fibroblast lines were obtained from unused, existing pathological human tissue samples, and therefore is exempt (exemption 4).

All patients fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of IPF as established by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). For this study, new primary IPF fibroblast lines were generated as tissue became available.

Since autophagic function is predominantly regulated by Akt/mTOR kinases, this finding suggests that autophagic activity remains low when IPF fibroblasts are attached to polymerized collagen as a result of abnormally enhanced mTOR activity, a concept we previously published <xref rid="pone.0094616-Larsson1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Therefore, we next hypothesized that IPF fibroblasts have enhanced mTOR kinase activity due to the aberrant PTEN/Akt axis thereby inhibiting autophagic activity on collagen. To test this hypothesis, we first measured mTOR kinase activity using ser 2485 phosphorylated mTOR level as a surrogate marker from randomly selected 11 control and 10 IPF fibroblasts. Overall, the phosphorylated mTOR protein level was significantly higher in IPF fibroblasts compared with that of control fibroblasts cultured on collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094616-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> left and right). Likewise, when we measured p-mTOR expression in each control and IPF cell line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094616-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094616-g002">2A</xref>, p-mTOR expression was highly up-regulated in most individual IPF cell lines compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094616.s001">Figure S1A &#x00026; 1B</xref>). Therefore, taken together, our results showed that there is a clear distinction between control and IPF fibroblasts in that p-mTOR and LC3-2 are inversely related to each other, and autophagy is abnormally altered in IPF fibroblasts in response to collagen matrix. We next examined mTOR kinase activity in IPF and control fibroblasts as a function of time. mTOR kinase activity was high and relatively unaltered in response to IPF fibroblast attachment to collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094616-g002">Fig. 2B</xref> upper lanes 3&#x00026;4 and lower panel). In contrast, phosphorylation of mTOR was barely detectable in control fibroblasts as a function of time (lanes 1&#x00026;2). These data suggest that when IPF fibroblasts attach to polymerized collagen, the activity of mTOR kinase is up-regulated and remains high. To confirm this finding that mTOR kinase is abnormally high in IPF fibroblasts on collagen, we next treated control and IPF fibroblasts with various doses of mTOR kinase inhibitor rapamycin and measured mTOR activity on collagen matrix.

To test this, control and IPF fibroblasts were grown on polymerized collagen in the presence of various doses of autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine (3MA) or chloroquine (CQ), and cell viability was measured. If autophagy protects IPF cells from collagen induced cell death, the inhibition of autophagy can increase cell death. Viability of IPF fibroblasts was moderately decreased in the presence of 1 to 100 &#x000b5;M of 3MA or CQ (&#x0223c;10% and &#x0223c;20% decrease in cell viability when 100 &#x000b5;M of 3MA or CQ used, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094616-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).

These data show that IPF fibroblasts with low autophagy activity are less susceptible to polymerized collagen induced cell death when autophagic activity is inhibited due to pre-existing low autophagic activity. In contrast, control fibroblasts with enhanced autophagic activity become highly sensitized to polymerized collagen induced cell death in the presence of autophagy inhibitors, which further suggests that abnormal alteration of autophagy is linked to fibroblast viability. In order to verify whether autophagy inhibitors have an intrinsic toxic effect on viability of fibroblasts, IPF and control fibroblasts were treated with various doses of 3MA or CQ on tissue culture plates in the absence of polymerized collagen, and viable cells were measured.

When 10 &#x000b5;M of 3MA and CQ was used in IPF fibroblasts expressing PTEN, there was a significant decrease in cell viability compared with DMSO/water treated cells (&#x0223c;35% decrease in viable cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094616.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). Furthermore, when IPF cells expressing PTEN were treated with 100 &#x000b5;M of both 3MA and CQ together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094616-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), there was substantial decrease (&#x0223c;42%) in viable cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094616-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). Likewise, when IPF cells expressing dominant negative Akt were cultured on collagen in the presence of autophagy inhibitors, viable cells were also decreased (&#x0223c;20%). Collectively, these data demonstrate that when IPF fibroblasts attach to polymerized collagen, the altered PTEN/Akt pathway inhibits autophagy activity, which subsequently desensitizes IPF fibroblasts from polymerized collagen-induced cell death. However, IPF fibroblasts can become re-sensitized to polymerized collagen induced cell death by the forced activation of PTEN or dominant negative Akt in the presence of autophagy inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>mTOR activity is high while LC3-2 is low in cells within the fibroblastic foci of patients with IPF</title><p>Since autophagic activity is low in IPF fibroblasts cultured on polymerized collagen, we next sought to examine whether our <italic>in vitro</italic> results can be also found in myofibroblasts within the fibroblastic foci of IPF patient specimens.

However, IPF fibroblasts elude this apoptotic process and maintain highly proliferative and apoptotic-resistant properties by using the PTEN/Akt axis, which eventually destroys lung function by producing excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, <xref rid="pone.0094616-Kuhn1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094616-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094616-WallachDayan1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A recent study showed that autophagy is not activated in IPF fibroblasts and the inhibition of autophagy promotes extracellular matrix production, suggesting a direct link between the deregulation of autophagy and the fibrotic process <xref rid="pone.0094616-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094616-Ricci1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We found that IPF fibroblasts have abnormally low autophagic activity on polymerized collagen. Thus, these observations suggest that IPF fibroblasts have a pathologically altered mechanism to desensitize themselves to collagen matrix driven stress by maintaining low autophagic activity.</p><p>We previously found that when IPF fibroblasts attach to collagen rich matrix, Akt activity is up-regulated by PTEN suppression, which subsequently increases cell proliferation <xref rid="pone.0094616-Xia2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094616-Nho1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Akt is a crucial kinase regulating mTOR function and LC3-2 expression is inversely regulated by mTOR kinase activity. Thus, our hypothesis was that mTOR kinase activity is aberrantly up-regulated as a result of abnormally high Akt activity in IPF fibroblasts on collagen, inhibiting autophagosome formation. Our experiments demonstrated that IPF fibroblasts are less sensitized to polymerized collagen due to the aberrant PTEN/Akt axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094616-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). In contrast, increased induction of autophagic activity was found as a result of Akt inhibition due to enhanced PTEN activity when control fibroblasts were cultured on collagen matrix.</p><fig id="pone-0094616-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0094616.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the desensitization to polymerized collagen induced cell death in IPF fibroblasts.</title><p>We previously found that when control fibroblasts are attached to polymerized collagen, cell death is increased <xref rid="pone.0094616-Nho2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In contrast, IPF fibroblasts are resistant to collagen matrix induced cell death. In this study, we further elucidate the underlying mechanism that bestows a highly viable IPF fibroblast phenotype in response to polymerized collagen. When IPF fibroblasts are allowed to interact with collagen matrix, Akt activity is inappropriately high due to PTEN suppression, which in turn increases mTOR kinase activity. Autophagy in IPF fibroblasts is then subsequently suppressed, and this pathological event desensitizes IPF fibroblasts to polymerized collagen induced cell death.

Downwards arrow indicates reduced activity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0094616.g008"/></fig><p>Cells constantly monitor their surrounding environment to maintain their homeostasis, and autophagy is activated when cells are exposed to an unfavorable/stress causing environment. <xref rid="pone.0094616-Rote1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094616-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094616-Maiuri1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Thus, it is thought that the inhibition of the protective role of autophagy can sensitize cells to stress, which facilitates cells to be highly susceptible for polymerized collagen driven cell death. A prior study already documented that the inhibition of autophagic function in HeLa cells by 3MA treatment sensitizes them to a serum starved condition, thereby increasing cell death <xref rid="pone.0094616-Boya1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Likewise, we also found that enhanced cell death occurred when autophagic activity was inhibited in control fibroblasts on collagen matrices. However, the viability of IPF fibroblasts was relatively higher compared with control fibroblasts in the presence of autophagy inhibitors. These results strongly suggest that when IPF fibroblasts attach to polymerized collagen matrix, enhanced Akt/mTOR kinase activities suppress autophagy induction, and that further inhibition of already low autophagy has a minimal effect on cell viability. However, this finding can be reversed when PTEN is re-introduced or Akt is inhibited in the presence of autophagy inhibitors in IPF fibroblasts. These data show that the altered PTEN/Akt/mTOR axis suppresses autophagic induction when IPF fibroblasts are cultured on collagen, permitting IPF fibroblasts to maintain viability on collagen. Unlike IPF fibroblasts, we previously found that enhanced cell death occurs when control cells were cultured on collagen for an extensive time period <xref rid="pone.0094616-Nho2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Thus, it is thought that control fibroblasts sense polymerized collagen as a stress, and that autophagy is initially used as a defense mechanism to protect them from collagen matrix induced cell death until it reaches its threshold. However, IPF cells maintain low autophagy on collagen and this aberrant function permits IPF fibroblasts to maintain their viability.</p><p>Our results suggest that there are biological differences in LC3-2 and mTOR kinase activities in IPF and control fibroblasts. To address this, we analyzed multiple control and IPF fibroblasts cultured on polymerized collagen. We found that IPF fibroblasts have abnormally low autophagic activity in response to collagen matrix and this is due to an altered PTEN/Akt/mTOR axis. Our results were also supported from another group's prior finding that autophagic activity is reduced in IPF fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0094616-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In our current study, we further demonstrate that IPF fibroblasts acquire additional pathological properties by suppressing PTEN/Akt/mTOR-dependent autophagic activity, which permits IPF fibroblasts to efficiently maintain their viable phenotype on collagen rich matrix. Although our results indicate that IPF fibroblasts maintain low autophagy on polymerized collagen due to the deregulation of mTOR, we cannot rule out the possibility that an mTOR-independent mechanism to suppress LC3-2 expression exists. Because biological heterogeneity exists in patient specimens due to various ages, health, sex, and life styles (smoking, etc), it is a plausible assumption that each specimen is not biologically identical. Nevertheless, our main goal of this study was to examine whether enhanced Akt/mTOR suppresses LC3-2 expression in most IPF fibroblasts on collagen and we found that when IPF fibroblasts interact with collagen rich matrix, the alteration of a Akt/mTOR axis can contribute to the desensitization of IPF fibroblasts to the stress inducing effects of polymerized collagen.</p><p>Several experiments have previously been conducted to elucidate the role of autophagy on cell death from environmental stress, and our studies are further supported by their findings. For example, autophagy serves as a cell survival mechanism and suppression of autophagy via inhibition of lysosomal function contributes to zVAD-induced necrotic cell death <xref rid="pone.0094616-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Also, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy results in increased cell death, suggesting a protective role of autophagy <xref rid="pone.0094616-Sishi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Furthermore, Akt inhibition promotes autophagy and sensitizes PTEN null tumors to chloroquine <xref rid="pone.0094616-Degtyarev1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Lamoureux et al. also reported that the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine cooperates with the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 to inhibit autophagy, and sensitizes tumor cells to AZD5363-induced cell death in prostate cancer models <xref rid="pone.0094616-Lamoureux1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. These studies reveal that cells are able to utilize autophagy to protect themselves from stressful environments and the alteration of PTEN/Akt sensitizes cells to cell death- inducing stimuli when autophagic function is inhibited. Likewise, although autophagic activity was low in IPF fibroblasts on collagen, we also found that the modification of the PTEN/Akt axis increased autophagy and the subsequent inhibition of autophagic function significantly promotes IPF fibroblast cell death. Based on our results, it is apparent that IPF fibroblasts elude polymerized collagen driven stress by the alteration of the crucial PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway and low autophagic activity, which facilitates the desensitization process to polymerized collagen induced cell death. Therefore we propose that the understanding of this regulatory pathway may be a critical event in the response of fibroblast attachment to collagen rich matrix and targeting this axis may be a promising approach for promoting IPF fibroblast cell death. In summary, we found that IPF fibroblasts utilize the PTEN/Akt/mTOR-dependent autophagic regulatory pathway to elude the cell death inducing effect of polymerized collagen, and the alteration of the PTEN/Akt axis and the inhibition of autophagic activity may be an effective approach to sensitize IPF fibroblasts to collagen matrix and a useful strategy to limit the progression of IPF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0094616.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
