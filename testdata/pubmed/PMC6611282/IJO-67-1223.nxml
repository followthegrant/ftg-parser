He had undergone trabeculectomy with retinal cryopexy and laser photocoagulation in the left eye previously. He was seen to have a port wine stain on the left side of the face with hypertrophy of the lip and palate. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/80 in left eye. Intraocular pressure was 10 mmHg in both the eyes. A thin, cystic bleb was seen superiorly. The right eye fundus examination was unremarkable except for vertical cup disc ratio of 0.6. Diffuse orange red color was noted on left eye fundus examination [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]. The cup disc ratio was 0.8. Chorioretinal atrophic patches were seen in the superior and temporal periphery. Dilated tortuous vessels with terminal dark red saccules were witnessed in temporal and inferotemporal quadrants. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed characteristic &#x0201c;fluorescein cap&#x0201d; lesions suggestive of cavernous hemangioma of the retina. On optical coherence tomography subfoveal choroidal thickness was 675 microns in the right eye and 725 microns in the affected left eye. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was normal. The family history was negative for both the diseases. Since the patient's vision and intraocular pressure were maintained, he was observed further without any intervention.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Fundus images of case 1 showing widefield image of the retina (a) with areas of cryo atrophy and laser marks.

He had a port wine stain on the left side of the face associated with hemi-facial hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>]. The visual acuity was 20/80 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. The right eye showed inferior vitreous hemorrhage due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (DR). The left eye showed reddish orange fundus color due to a diffuse choroidal hemangioma. Furthermore, the superotemporal and temporal retina revealed the presence of large, flat neovascularization (NVE) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]. The fluorescein angiography revealed extensive capillary non-perfusion in addition to many other NVEs throughout the fundus [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>]. The intraocular pressure in both the eyes was 18 mmHg. The ultrasonography as well as the swept-source optical coherence tomography confirmed diffuse thickening of the choroid. The subfoveal choroidal thickness was 341 and 467 microns in the right and left eye, respectively [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>]. A diagnosis of proliferative DR with SWS was made. Systemic examination and MRI of the brain was found to be normal.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>External photo of the face, case 2.

However, after the second sitting of panretinal photocoagulation, the left eye developed peripheral shallow choroidal detachment along with shallow inferior exudative retinal detachment [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]. Further laser was deferred and the patient was given topical steroid eye drops. This exudation resolved spontaneously over the next two weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Traditionally, SWS includes vascular tumors of the choroid with normal retinal vasculature. There are sporadic reports of retinal vascular anomalies such as dilated retinal veins and retinal arteriovenous communications associated with SWS. Gerwin and Char[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] described a 7-year-old girl with features of SWS who also had dilated retinal vessels leading to an involuted angiomatous lesion in the affected eye. Allen and Parlette[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported a patient with port wine stain and a presumed Coats disease in the affected eye. However, in their patient no active telangiectatic or exudative lesions were seen. But it was presumed from a previous history of cryotherapy done elsewhere that the patient might be harboring Coats disease.</p><p>Diffuse choroidal hemangioma and cavernous hemangioma of the retina are rarely seen together. Cavernous hemangioma is usually considered to be the only ocular manifestation of this autosomal dominant condition. Sarraf <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] described a family with neuro-, oculo- cutaneous phacomatosis referred to as cavernoma multiplex. Members of one family showed cerebral cavernous hemangiomas, cutaneous hemangiomas and choroidal hemangiomas. One member had a retinal cavernous hemangioma alone. The rest of the members had cerebral and cutaneous hemangiomas. It was thought to reflect a variable expression of the disorder and the causative gene was thought to be in the locus of 7q11&#x02013;q22. However, none of the affected members had both retinal cavernous hemangioma and a choroidal hemangioma together and certainly not in the same eye.</p><p>Our patient shows the unique features of a retinal cavernous hemangioma and a diffuse choroidal hemangioma in the same eye. No genetic studies could be done for this patient, but the family history did not reveal any familial diseases such as SWS or related syndromes or retinal cavernous hemangioma. However, the presence of retinal cavernous hemangioma or a choroidal hemangioma should alert one to search for possible systemic and familial involvement.</p><p>The second patient in this report showed presence of high risk proliferative DR in the eye affected with diffuse choroidal hemangioma. This association has not been reported in the literature. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) overlying the choroidal hemangioma can show either hyperplasia or atrophy. Shields and Shields[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] found thinning and irregularity of RPE in 40% of cases with choroidal hemangioma. These changes accord protection from the development of DR. As a result one rarely sees DR in extreme cases of retinitis pigmentosa, pathologic myopia, etc., In a population based cohort study, Chen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found no significant association of retinitis pigmentosa with DR. They concluded that the loss of the outer retina might decrease oxygen consumption by the photoreceptors and thus prevent DR.</p><p>Arora <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] showed a thickened choroid in the affected eyes of patients with SWS which may remain asymptomatic, or develop subretinal hemorrhage and serous retinal detachment leading to vision loss.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] There is a higher risk of developing exudative retinal detachment either spontaneously or induced by drug.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Pan retinal laser photocoagulation has been recommended for the management of high risk proliferative DR, however it has been shown to result in increased choroidal thickness and blood flow till after 1 week.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Laser photocoagulation in already thickened and vascular choroid may lead to serious retinal detachment. Various modalities of treatment have been suggested including photodynamic therapy, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies injections, propranolol, and observation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Our patient resolved spontaneously with observation alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we report two cases of SWS with diffuse choroidal hemangioma who also had retinal cavernous hemangioma and retinal NVE due to proliferative DR in the affected eye.
