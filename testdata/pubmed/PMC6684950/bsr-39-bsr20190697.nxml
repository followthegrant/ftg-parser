Oxidative stress is considered to be the primary cellular event in acetaminophen-induced liver injury [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. When taken at overdose, most of APAP is metabolized by Phase II conjugating enzymes, mainly sulfotransferase (SULT) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), converting it to nontoxic compounds which are then excreted with the urine. Of the remaining APAP, approximately 5&#x02013;9% is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), mainly CYP2E1 into the highly reactive intermediate metabolite N-actyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Usually, NAPQI is rapidly detoxified by conjugating with glutathione (GSH). However, when Phase II metabolizing enzymes are saturated after APAP overdose, excessive NAPQ1 deplete GSH, leading to covalent binding of sulfhydryl groups in cellular proteins, this results liver oxidative stress [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we found that EOs from <italic>Nepeta cataria L.</italic> have a liver protective ability on acetaminophen-induced liver injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Supercritical fluid extraction of essential oil from <italic>Nepeta cataria L.</italic></title><p>The EO from leaf of <italic>Nepeta cataria L.</italic> was extracted by supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> extraction system.

The sulfation and glucuronidation pathways are considered detoxification routes, while the CYP oxidation pathway generates NAPQI, a reactive and toxic species. In case of acetaminophen toxicity, the Phase II conjugation enzymes are saturated, and a higher fraction is converted to NAPQI that leads to oxidative stress of liver. ROS is one of major factors in oxidative stress progress. Nrf2, which is likely activated by redox status changes induced by NAPQI. Mechanistically, the activated Nrf2 transfers from cytoplasm to nucleus, then it leads to transcriptional activation of antioxidant enzymes, such as NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), HO-1, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and GSTA, which increased the expression of SOD and CAT [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Besides, APAP caused severe liver injury characterized by significantly increased serum AST and ALT levels, ROS and hepatic MDA, as well as liver SOD, CAT depletions.</p><p>NAC can be used to detoxify for acetaminophen poisoning. It has the functions of anti-oxidation, scavenging oxygen free radicals, preventing DNA damage, regulating cell metabolic activity, regulating gene expression and signal transduction, and inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators in the body [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. NAC has the FDA approval for the treatment of potentially hepatotoxic doses of APAP. Therefore, we used NAC as the positive control drugs.</p><p>The first record of <italic>Nepeta cataria L.</italic> was documented in the ancient Chinese herbal book Ben-Cao-Gang-Mu (Ming Dynasty, by Shizhen Li). The book stated that the fired leaves and tender stems of <italic>Nepeta cataria L.</italic> could be served as food and tea. EO was extracted by different methods. SFE method was chosen in food industries, and has been extensively used to remove metal ions from various solid and liquid matrices of environmental samples. Different areas culturing <italic>Nepeta cataria L.</italic> have a variety of different ingredients, and uses for different functions. However, the function of <italic>Nepeta cataria L.</italic> was unclear.</p><p>In our studies, we found that EOs from <italic>Nepeta cataria L.</italic> up-regulated the expression and activities of Nrf2 and detoxification enzymes including UGTs and SULTs, as well as inhibited the activity of CYP2E1, which decreased plasma concentration of APAP and accelerated APAP harmless metabolism. Our data also showed that the effectiveness of EOs was as good as the NAC.</p><p>In summary, EOs from <italic>Nepeta cataria L.</italic> are effective in APAP-induced liver injury. They can be considered as a potential natural resource to develop hepatoprotective agent and feed additive instead of antibiotics. The results from the present study might supply useful functional food and better the understanding of the antioxidative characteristics of EOs from traditional herbal <italic>Nepeta cataria L.</italic></p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec5" sec-type="funding"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the foundation of Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province [grant number SXZRKXJJ-17775].
