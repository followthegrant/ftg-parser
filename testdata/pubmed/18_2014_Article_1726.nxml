However, even though the nuclear export signal 1 (NES1) of NS2 does not play a requisite role in NS2&#x02013;Crm1 interaction, there is no doubt that NES1 is crucial for vRNP nuclear export. While the mechanism of the NES1 is still unclear, it is speculated that certain host partners might mediate the NES1 function through their interaction with NES1. In the present study, chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 3 (CHD3) was identified as a novel host nuclear protein for locating NS2 and Crm1 on dense chromatin for NS2 and Crm1-dependent vRNP nuclear export. CHD3 was confirmed to interact with NES1 in NS2, and a disruption to this interaction by mutation in NES1 significantly delayed viral vRNPs export and viral propagation. Further, the knockdown of CHD3 would affect the propagation of the wild-type virus but not the mutant with the weakened NS2&#x02013;CHD3 interaction. Therefore, this study demonstrates that NES1 is required for maximal binding of NS2 to CHD3, and that the NS2&#x02013;CHD3 interaction on the dense chromatin contributed to the NS2-mediated vRNP nuclear export.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00018-014-1726-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>CHD3</kwd><kwd>Dense chromatin</kwd><kwd>VRNPs export</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Basel 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is the causative agent of seasonal influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and of the pandemics of 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is a serious health threat with its capacity for cross-species transmission and potential to cause a 1918-like pandemic by strains such as avian H5N1 or H7N9 viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The eight segments of the RNA genome from IAV form ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNP) with nucleoprotein (NP) and the trimeric polymerase. Unlike most RNA viruses, the transcription and replication of IAV take place in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Newly synthesized vRNPs exit from the nucleus into the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and assemble in the viral budding sites at the plasma membrane for the productive infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The nuclear export is a significant event in the viral life cycle. Both cellular and viral factors participate in the process. An important cellular factor for vRNP export is Crm1, a nuclear export receptor for proteins containing a characteristic leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In Crm1-dependent nuclear export, Crm1 forms a ternary complex with GTPase Ran and GTP in the nucleus for trafficking protein through the nuclear pore complex to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Influenza protein NS2 (a.k.a. nuclear export protein or NEP) is essential for Crm1-dependent vRNP export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Proteolytic sensitivity analysis suggests that the C-terminus of the NS2 protein adopts a relatively rigid conformation, and that the N-terminus that contains two NESs (NES1 and NES2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) has a more exposed conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Before the new NES2 was discovered, NES1 was the only NES in NS2 and contradictory conclusions can be drawn from the available data with regard to the key role of NES1 in Crm1-dependent vRNP export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. On the one hand, this is why vRNPs nuclear export adopts a Crm1-dependent manner, whereas NS2&#x02013;Crm1 interaction is NES1-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. So far, the issue has been resolved by the existence of NES2; that is, NS2&#x02013;Crm1 interaction would occur through the NES2 binding with Crm1, even though the NES1 was deleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. On the other hand, this is why mutation at the crucial residues in the NES1 sequence in NS2 did not abolish the interaction between NS2 and Crm1 but significantly affected the vRNP nuclear export executed by NS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This contradiction is still&#x000a0;unresolved and it raises the question as to whether there are other factors assisting the process through its interaction with NES1.</p><p>In the present study, CHD3 was identified as a novel host protein involved in the NS2-associated nuclear export of vRNP. Our data suggest that the interaction would assist in tethering NS2 and Crm1 to vRNP facilitating the export. In addition, since only after CHD3 interacted with NES1, would the vRNPs be exported, it suggests that the interaction would expose the otherwise hidden NES1 for nuclear export.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>COS-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium (HyClone, Thermo Scientific, Beijing, China) supplemented with 10&#x000a0;% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Thermo Scientific, Quarantine, Australia).

Myc-tagged wild-type NS2 (Myc-NS2) and mutant NS2 [Myc-NS2(L19S)] expression plasmids were generated by inserting each ORF into the pCDNA3.1-Myc vector.

The pHW2000-NS [NS2(L19S)] was generated by site-mutation, in which a T to C mutation was introduced at position nt 539, which would not change NS1 protein. pHW2000-Flag-NS2 was constructed as follows.

To indicate the role of NES1&#x02013;CHD3 interaction in the nuclear export, the NS2 and NS2(L19S) were fused with RFP.

As the observation of delayed vRNP export by NES1 mutation during IAV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], it is curious that the mutation in NES1 did not reduce the interaction of NS2 with Crm1 but hindered the fusion export, although to a lesser extent.

A recombinant virus, WD&#x02013;NS2(L19S), was generated with this mutation for the investigation. The overlapping NS1 was not changed in the resulting virus. It could be shown that, when compared with WD infection, at early stage of WD&#x02013;NS2(L19S) infection, NS2 tended to enter into cyt, nuc and ch150 fractions, and less Crm1 and NS2 were in the &#x0003e;ch500 and ch500 fractions, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b <italic>a</italic>). The observation were further supported by statistical analysis which showed significant difference of Crm1 between nuc and &#x0003e;ch500 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B, b), and significant difference of NS2 between ch150 and ch500 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b <italic>c</italic>) in WD but not WD&#x02013;NS2(L19S) infection, confirming the role of NS2&#x02013;CHD3 interaction in locating NS2 and Crm1 on dense chromation.

At 6&#x000a0;h p.i., however, while the obvious export of vRNP could be observed under WD infection with NP translocation to the cytoplasm, WD&#x02013;NS2(L19S) infection exhibited minimal vRNP export.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p>IAV vRNPs display a biphasic pattern of intracellular localization during infection. They translocate in the nucleus to allow transcription to take place early in the life cycle of the virus, and are exported to the cytoplasm for package into progeny virions later in the life cycle. The current &#x02018;&#x02018;daisy-chain&#x02019;&#x02019; model indicates that during translocation of vRNPs, interaction between the IAV NS2 and Crm1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] is important for export of vRNPs to facilitate viral propagation. The translocation of vRNPs also depends on the function of NES1 in NS2. However, puzzling conclusions can be obtained from various experiments. On the one hand, NES1 would facilitate nuclear export dependent on Crm1 when it was fused onto other polypeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], implicating a direct interaction with Crm1 as with most other NESs. On the other hand, previous study indicated that the NES1 in NS2 does not contribute to binding NS2 to Crm1; it was demonstrated that mutation on NES1 did not affect the interaction between NS2 and Crm1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and leptomycin B treatment, an inhibitor to Crm1, has no effect on the localization of NS2 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that another leucine-rich NES2 is also involved in the nuclear export of vRNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The interaction between NES2 and Crm1 may explain why deletion of NES1 does not abolish the NS2&#x02013;Crm1 interaction. Nevertheless, despite all these studies, an unsettled question can still be raised as to why, in the case of NES1 mutation, NS2 by itself could not efficiently execute the export through its interaction with Crm1. At least we can rule out that the disruption of NES1 reduces the NS2&#x02013;Crm1 interaction leading to the weaker nuclear export, since the disruption of NES1 actually enhanced the NS2&#x02013;Crm1 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>So, it seems that NES1 would not merely function through binding to Crm1. While the mechanism underlying the NES1 remains unclear, certain host partners can be proposed to interact with and mediate the NES1 function. As identified by our experiments, CHD3 could be an important host factor in vRNP export via interaction with the NES1 domain. From the data obtained, at least two possible mechanisms can be raised to interpret the role of the interaction in vRNP export.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The interaction would increase the export factors (NS2 and Crm1) around the vRNP, facilitating the export. It has been demonstrated that vRNPs were assembled on the chromatin before being exported to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our data indicated that NS2 could be recruited to the dense chromatin via the NS2&#x02013;CHD3 interaction. The subsequent NS2&#x02013;Crm1 interaction would allow Crm1 preferential access to it, as was observed from the HIV-1 Rev protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The processes thus increased the export factors (NS2 and Crm1) around the vRNA on dense chromatin, which would aid vRNP export. Though it is technically difficult to observe the accurate subcellular localization for vRNPs, NS2, CHD3 and Crm1 at the same time, their colocalization on chromatin could be indirectly supported by the fact that the CHD3&#x02013;NS2 interaction is important for tethering NS2 and Crm1 onto dense chromatin for vRNPs export. We should note that, since the construct with mutation in NS2 NES1 still apparently retains interaction with CHD3, the NES1 just seems required for maximal binding, which explains why the mutation in the NES1 only delayed but did not abrogate the export of vRNPs. Additionally, though NP would also be a candidate for recruiting Crm1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], our data indicated that NS2 should play a more important role in recruiting Crm1 than NP, because the shift of the location of Crm1 changed as did NS2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d <italic>a</italic>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The interaction would expose the NES1 for performing its function in vRNP export. During infection, it can be demonstrated that NS2 locates in the nucleus at an early stage (3.5&#x000a0;p.i.) (Fig. S3 in supplemental materials) and in the cytoplasm (5&#x000a0;p.i.) or cell membrane (6&#x000a0;p.i.) at later stages of the infection (Fig. S3 in supplemental materials). NS2 can also be shown to colocalize with NP/vRNP throughout the infection (Fig. S3 in supplemental materials). This implies that NES1 in NS2 could be hidden in the early stages of the viral life cycle and exposed to execute its function in the later stages. The data in the present study demonstrated that the vRNP export was executed only after the CHD3&#x02013;NES1 interaction occurred. Thus, our data raised the possibility that the interaction between NES1 in NS2 and CHD3 on chromatin kept the NES1 exposed for nuclear export after vRNP assembly. Supporting this, when the NS2 was fused with the RFP, the NS2&#x02013;RFP fusion protein instead completely located in the cytoplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), in contrast to the whole cell distribution of RFP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). However, when the L19S mutation was introduced into the NES1, which led to reduced interaction between NS2 and CHD3, NS2(L19S)&#x02013;RFP relocated to some extent into the nucleus (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). The partial relocation of NS2(L19S)&#x02013;RFP into nucleus would be explained by the fact that L19S mutation just reduced but did not abolish the NS2&#x02013;CHD3 interaction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). The role of the interaction in NES1 exposure could be illustrated using a monoclonal antibody against the NES1.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Previous research has shown that chromatin regions appear to be more dynamic than expected, indicating that heterochromatin is a platform which plays roles in the recruitment and spreading of regulatory proteins implicated in various aspects of chromosome biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Other studies have found the interaction of NP with nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and the interaction of viral polymerase complex with CHD6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These would suggest the mechanism which could mediate the linkage of the subunits of vRNPs with dense chromatin. Further, the interaction of M1 with core histones 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] was reported. Our findings additionally indicated the translocation of NS2 on dense chromatin at an early stage of infection. Therefore, all necessary subunits could be recruited to the dense chromatin, which supported that the chromatin was an excellent platform for IAV vRNPs assembly and its export.</p><p>In summary, this study identifies a new factor in NS2 mediated nuclear export. CHD3 can not only provide the conduit for the assembly of NS2 with vRNP on the chromatin but its interaction with NES1 in NS2 may also result in its exposure for Crm1-dependent nuclear export. Together with the existence of NES2, these observations consolidate the data from previously seemingly contradictory data and provide a crucial link in understanding the vRNP export during the life cycle of IAV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
