Data pooled from 21 studies indicate an overall prevalence estimate of 10.7% in community-dwelling older adults [<xref rid="AFV170C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There is no generally accepted definition of frailty; however, it has been defined as a &#x02018;state of increased vulnerability to poor resolution of homeostasis after a stressor event, resulting from cumulative loss of physiological reserve&#x02019; [<xref rid="AFV170C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Those suffering from frailty have been found to have an increased risk of hospitalisation and falls [<xref rid="AFV170C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Factors linked with the development and progression of frailty include smoking, alcohol consumption and depression [<xref rid="AFV170C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], obesity [<xref rid="AFV170C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the presence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes [<xref rid="AFV170C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is a prominent symptom of fibromyalgia, affecting up to 11% of adult men and women [<xref rid="AFV170C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and it is linked with adverse health outcomes including an increased mortality risk [<xref rid="AFV170C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this study, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria were used to identify those suffering from CWP [<xref rid="AFV170C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; subjects had to have pain for a minimum of 3 months in both the left and right sides of the body, above and below the waist and in the axial skeleton. CWP appears to be fundamentally different in its aetiology compared with more localised rheumatic or osteoarthritic pains. Risk factors for CWP include psychological distress [<xref rid="AFV170C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], poor sleep [<xref rid="AFV170C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], low levels of physical activity and being overweight [<xref rid="AFV170C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="AFV170C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Perturbations in the Hypothalamic&#x02013;Pituitary&#x02013;Adrenal axis have been linked with the development of chronic pain [<xref rid="AFV170C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and we hypothesised that CWP, by acting as a stressor, would be associated with an increased risk of incident frailty. Previous studies provide support for a link between pain and frailty, although they have been unable to determine the direction of the observed associations because of the cross-sectional nature of the data [<xref rid="AFV170C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="AFV170C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this analysis was to determine whether the occurrence of CWP predisposes middle-aged and older men to the development of, or worsening, frailty.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="afv170_s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="afv170_s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>Details regarding recruitment and study set-up have been described elsewhere [<xref rid="AFV170C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, 3,369 community-dwelling men aged 40&#x02013;79 were recruited from population registers in eight centres: Florence (Italy), Leuven (Belgium), &#x00141;&#x000f3;d&#x0017a; (Poland), Malm&#x000f6; (Sweden), Manchester (UK), Santiago de Compostela (Spain), Szeged (Hungary) and Tartu (Estonia). Subjects were mailed a study information pack, a short postal questionnaire, and they attended a health screening at a local research clinic. Of those who completed baseline assessments, 86% (adjusted for mortality) completed the follow-up assessments with a mean of 4.3 years (range 3.0&#x02013;5.7 years; SD = 0.3) after baseline data were collected [<xref rid="AFV170C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. All assessments were carried out using standardised protocols. Ethical approval for the study was obtained in accordance with local institutional requirements in each centre. All subjects provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="afv170_s2b"><title>Assessments</title><sec id="afv170_s2b1"><title>Postal questionnaire</title><p>The initial postal questionnaire captured demographic, health and lifestyle information including smoking and alcohol consumption. Subjects were also asked whether they were currently being treated for asthma, chronic bronchitis, adrenal and/or prostate disease, epilepsy, peptic ulcer, thyroid disease, heart, kidney and/or liver conditions, testicular and/or pituitary disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and if they had ever suffered a stroke or been diagnosed with cancer.</p></sec><sec id="afv170_s2b2"><title>Other assessments</title><p>Subjects who attended for assessment completed an interviewer-assisted questionnaire that included the Beck's Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) [<xref rid="AFV170C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the 36-Item Medical Outcomes Study Survey (SF-36) [<xref rid="AFV170C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) [<xref rid="AFV170C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Physical function tests included the Reuben's Physical Performance Test (PPT) [<xref rid="AFV170C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Tinetti's balance and postural stability index [<xref rid="AFV170C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Three neuropsychological tests were conducted to evaluate cognitive function; these measured visuo-perceptual abilities, executive function and memory [<xref rid="AFV170C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the recognition component of visual memory retrieval [<xref rid="AFV170C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and cognitive processing speed and visual scanning [<xref rid="AFV170C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These assessments were used to provide deficits to make up the FI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/afv170/-/DC1">Supplementary data, Appendix 1, available in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online</ext-link>).

The variables used fulfilled the requirements for the development of an FI; they related to health status, increased with age, did not appear too early in life and covered a range of systems. The deficits included co-morbidities and cognitive functioning, as well as items from the BDI-II, the SF-36, the PTT and the Tinetti index (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/afv170/-/DC1">Supplementary data, Appendix 1 available in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online</ext-link>). The same deficits were used in the FI at baseline and follow-up. Binary variables were re-coded; &#x02018;0&#x02019; represented the absence of and &#x02018;1&#x02019; the presence of a deficit. A value of &#x02018;0.5&#x02019; was used for categorical variables that indicated an intermediate response. Continuous variables were dichotomised based on the 10th centile. The FI was calculated as the number of health deficits present in an individual divided by the number of deficits considered. The FI was categorised using published criteria [<xref rid="AFV170C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; robust subjects had FI scores &#x0003c;0.2, pre-frail subjects were 0.2&#x02013;0.35 and frail subjects were &#x0003e;0.35. The EMAS FI has been associated with an increased risk of mortality [<xref rid="AFV170C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and impaired overall sexual functioning [<xref rid="AFV170C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="afv170_s2d"><title>Ascertainment of pain status</title><p>Subjects were asked if they had experienced &#x02018;any pain which lasted for one day or more&#x02019; in the past month. Those who answered positively were then asked if their pain lasted 3 months or more and to indicate by shading a pain manikin. Those satisfying the ACR criteria for CWP were identified. Those participants who did report pain, but did not meet these criteria, were classified as experiencing &#x02018;some pain&#x02019; and those who did not report any pain were classified as experiencing &#x02018;no pain&#x02019;. Using this definition in EMAS, CWP has previously been associated with poor mental health, the presence of co-morbidities and recent adverse life events [<xref rid="AFV170C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="afv170_s2e"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Analyses were conducted using STATA SE v13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Depending on distribution, parametric (paired <italic>t</italic>-tests) and non-parametric (Wilcoxon rank sum) statistical approaches were used to describe differences in baseline characteristics between those non-frail at baseline and those who did or did not develop frailty at follow-up. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between CWP at baseline and the new occurrence of frailty. To facilitate the longitudinal analysis, only subjects who were either robust or pre-frail at baseline were included in these models. Analyses were performed unadjusted, then adjusted for baseline age and centre and subsequently for baseline BMI, depression, smoking status and physical activity. The results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Negative binomial regression was used to determine the association between CWP at baseline and an increase in FI at follow-up, with the change in FI as the dependent variable and CWP the main predictor. Negative binomial regression is typically used to model over-dispersed count variables. To facilitate this modelling approach, the FI was first multiplied by 100 to convert it to a scale from 0 to 100 (to yield integer values without changing the distribution), with 0 representing no deficits and 100 maximum deficits. Analyses were performed unadjusted, then adjusted for baseline age and centre, and subsequently for baseline BMI, depression, smoking status, physical activity and FI. As two items of the BDI-II were included as deficits in the FI; assessing changes in sleeping patterns and concentration; these were removed from the BDI-II score before running the analysis in order to avoid spurious associations being found. The results were reported as incident rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CIs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="afv170_s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="afv170_s3a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Of the 3,369 men who took part in EMAS, 2,736 subjects, mean age 59.2 years (SD 10.6), had complete data to allow FI characterisation at baseline and follow-up.

This was independent of previously identified risk factors such as smoking status, BMI and depressive symptoms.</p><p>Our data are consistent with the findings from earlier studies [<xref rid="AFV170C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="AFV170C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In a cross-sectional study of 1,705 men aged 70 or older, an association was found between frailty, defined using the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria, and intrusive pain (determined using a question from the Short-form 12-item health survey: &#x02018;During the past four weeks, how much did pain interfere with your normal work&#x02014;including both work outside the home and housework?&#x02019;), after adjustment for demographic factors, number of co-morbidities and arthritis [<xref rid="AFV170C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In a cross-sectional study of 4,968 men and women, moderate or greater levels of pain (assessed using a 5-point verbal descriptor scale: &#x02018;How much bodily pain have you had during the past 4 weeks?&#x02019;) were found to be associated with frailty, measured using self-report items from the Canadian Study of Health and Ageing [<xref rid="AFV170C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A key limitation with these cross-sectional studies is their inability to determine the temporal nature of the association. Our longitudinal data confirm an association between a baseline assessment of CWP and the subsequent development of, and worsening of, frailty over 4.3 years of follow-up.</p><p>We can hypothesise possible mechanisms linking chronic pain with the development of frailty. Chronic pain is associated with a variety of adverse health factors including depression and comorbidities. Karp <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="AFV170C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] argued that, due to the multidimensional impact CWP has on older people, it is plausible that it impacts on physiologic systems, reduces reserve and decreases one's ability to maintain homeostasis. This view was supported by Shega <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="AFV170C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], who argued that older adults with persistent pain and its associated conditions, including lack of sleep and poor nutrition, may experience a decrease in their reserve, which increases the likelihood of falls and cognitive dysfunction. The evidence that perturbations in the stress-hormone axis are linked with the development of CWP would be consistent with this [<xref rid="AFV170C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The strength of the association found between pain and frailty in the current study would appear to be stronger for CWP than some pain. This may be explained by CWP having more profound effects on a number of health outcomes than regional/short-lived pain [<xref rid="AFV170C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. CWP is also recognised by ACR as a meaningful clinical capture of severe pain, whereas it is not clear what the measure for &#x02018;some pain&#x02019; is capturing, which could suggest that there is a dose&#x02013;response relationship between pain and frailty.</p><p>Our findings are also consistent with earlier studies reporting associations between frailty and a variety of health and lifestyle factors. Hubbard and colleagues [<xref rid="AFV170C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported that heavy smokers (determined through self-report) were the most frail (using an FI) compared with light and never smokers. Blaum and colleagues [<xref rid="AFV170C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] conducted a cross-sectional analysis on 599 women aged 70&#x02013;79 and found that obesity (BMI &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was associated with frailty (defined using a &#x02018;frailty phenotype&#x02019; approach). Strawbridge and colleagues [<xref rid="AFV170C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] carried out analyses on prospective risk factors that were measured in 574 subjects aged 65&#x02013;102, over three decades. Frailty was categorised based on whether subjects had difficulties in two or more functional domains; both smoking and depression were cumulative predictors of frailty. Past research has also identified an association between frailty and social deprivation [<xref rid="AFV170C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and future research should take this into consideration when exploring the association between pain and frailty.</p><p>Our study has unique positive features; the prospective data were derived from a large population-based sample; a standardised approach was taken to the conduct of the study and established and validated measures were used to capture CWP and frailty. There are limitations; the response rate for participation at baseline was 41% with those who declined to take part being older, more likely to be current smokers and reporting experiencing less pain lasting at least 1 day in the past month, than those who participated in the study [<xref rid="AFV170C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Accordingly, the estimates of the occurrence of both frailty and CWP at baseline may differ from the base populations from which the subjects were recruited, and caution is required in interpreting these absolute estimates. Similarly, a number of men did not attend for the repeat survey; some had died while others declined to participate. Given this, the results relating to the absolute incidence of frailty need to be interpreted with some caution. It seems unlikely that any such selection factors would impact on the findings reported here which were based on internal comparison of those who took part. The data on CWP in this study were obtained by self-report and a shaded manikin&#x02014;it is possible that errors of recall or shading in the manikin may have resulted in some misclassification of exposure status (CWP); the effect of any such misclassification though would be to attenuate any real biological association. Finally, the cohort studied comprised predominantly Caucasian men, with a mean age of 59 years; therefore, caution is needed when extrapolating the findings beyond this group</p><p>In conclusion, CWP is associated with both incident, and worsening frailty in middle-aged and older European men, largely independent of health and lifestyle confounders. Our findings not only suggest potential opportunities for targeted interventions to reduce the occurrence of frailty, but also highlight that clinicians need to be more attentive of the pain status of older people. Further studies are needed to confirm our observations and identify the physiological mechanisms underpinning this association.</p><boxed-text position="anchor" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Key points</title></caption><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>CWP was associated with worsening frailty among older men, as assessed using an FI.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This association was largely independent of various health and lifestyle factors.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The aetiology of the relationship between pain and frailty requires further study.</p></list-item></list></p></boxed-text></sec><sec id="afv170_s5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="afv170_s6"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ageing/afv170/-/DC1">Supplementary data mentioned in the text are available to subscribers in <italic>Age and Ageing</italic> online</ext-link>.</p>
