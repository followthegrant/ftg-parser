Recently, inflammatory signals are suggested to be one of the most important factors in modulating chemoresistance and establishing metastatic lesions. In addition, epidemiological studies have demonstrated that periodontitis, the most common chronic inflammatory condition of the oral cavity, is closely associated with oral cancer. However, a correlation between chronic periodontitis and chemoresistance/metastasis has not been well established. Herein, we will present our study on whether sustained infection with <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, a major pathogen of chronic periodontitis, could modify the response of OSCC cells to chemotherapeutic agents and their metastatic capability <italic>in vivo</italic>. Tumor xenografts composed of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>&#x02013;infected OSCC cells demonstrated a higher resistance to Taxol through Notch1 activation, as compared with uninfected cells. Furthermore, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>&#x02013;infected OSCC cells formed more metastatic foci in the lung than uninfected cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Porphyromonas gingivalis</kwd><kwd>oral cancer</kwd><kwd>Taxol</kwd><kwd>Notch1</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which is the most common cancer of the oral cavity, is mainly treated with surgery alone. Because surgical treatment of OSCC sacrifices both important functionality and esthetics of the head and neck, surgical treatment of OSCC should be minimized or replaced with other treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, chemotherapy is used as an adjuvant therapy, not as a single treatment modality, for OSCC because it rarely results in a cure and has demonstrated limited effectiveness in OSCC [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, improvement of OSCC responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents is essential for patients with OSCC to obtain a better functional and cosmetic result from treatment that could be obtained through a deeper understanding of the reasons or mechanism involved in the low sensitivity of OSCC cells to chemotherapeutic agents.</p><p>Recently, the importance of signals from the tumor microenvironment that is composed of extracellular matrix, fibroblasts, and immune cells has been emphasized. Among the numerous factors in the microenvironment, signals of inflammatory stimuli confer resistance to chemotherapy and tumor progression [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Accordingly, associations between inflammation and cancer cells have been extensively studied in a variety of cancers such as gastric, lung, and colorectal cancer, suggesting that inflammatory mediators are linked to therapeutic resistance and increased aggressiveness of tumor cells, including their invasive and metastatic abilities [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It has been suggested that inflammation contributes to the formation, maintenance, and expansion of pluripotent cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small subpopulation of tumor cells with the capability of self-renewal, dedifferentiation, and tumorigenicity [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Notably, CSCs are also thought to be a major reason why cancer cells demonstrate aggressive behaviors such as chemoresistance and metastasis. This hypothesis can be supported by numerous studies including observations that CSCs are expanded and that prostaglandin E2, an inflammatory mediator, induces CSC expansion and accelerates the formation of liver metastases in mice by activating NF&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that inflammatory signals from the microenvironment modulate the responsiveness of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents through the acquisition of stem cell properties.</p><p>Chronic periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases of the oral cavity, especially in older patients. A relationship between periodontal diseases and oral cancer is strongly suspected because of the common occurrence of periodontitis, but this correlation has been investigated only in several epidemiological studies and a few experimental studies. The epidemiological studies demonstrated a higher risk of oral cancer in patients with periodontal disease [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and experimental studies indicated that <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, a major pathogen involved in chronic periodontitis, increased the invasive capability of OSCC cells through the production of MMP-2 and 9 [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recently, we also observed that acute and chronic exposure to <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> increased the migratory and invasive properties of oral cancer cells, with a higher secretion of MMPs [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that prolonged and repeated chronic exposure to <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> helped provide OSCC cells with resistance to Taxol by promoting CSC properties, suggesting that chronic periodontitis plays a role in the chemoresistance of OSCC cells [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although studies on a variety of cancers have been conducted for the association between cancer stemness and resistance to chemotherapy, there are few reports on a direct link between inflammation and chemoresistance. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no <italic>in vivo</italic> study has been performed on chronic periodontitis and the responsiveness of oral cancer to chemotherapeutic reagents. To clarify whether chronic periodontitis could modify the susceptibility of OSCC to chemotherapeutic agents <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined whether prolonged and repeated <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infection mimicking chronic periodontitis could affect the responsiveness of tumor xenografts to Taxol in mice. In addition, we investigated the mechanism involved in the chemoresistance of OSCC cells that were sustainedly infected with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, especially on the Notch pathway, because the most recent <italic>in vitro</italic> studies consistently suggested that Notch signaling promotes several malignant features of migration, invasion [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], chemoresistance [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and stemness [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Slower <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth was exhibited by OSCC cells sustainedly infected with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> than noninfected OSCC cells</title><p>It has been shown that Ca9-22 and SCC25 OSCC cells infected with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> showed lower proliferative activity than non-infected cells [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To further confirm that <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infection contributes to the slower growth of OSCC cells, we infected OSC-20 OSCC cells with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> twice and observed growth potential of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-infected and non-infected cells. As expected, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-infected OSC-20 cells displayed retarded growth in comparison with non-infected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To investigate whether chronic periodontitis could affect the growth of oral cancer <italic>in vivo</italic>, we compared the tumor volume induced by sustainedly <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-infected OSCC cells with that of uninfected control OSCC cells in nude mice. Briefly, cells were repeatedly infected with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> twice a week for 5 weeks. Then the right flank of a mouse was injected with the infected OSC-20 cells, and the left flank of the same mouse was injected with uninfected OSC-20 cells. To rule out potential animal-to-animal variations, infected and uninfected tumor cells were simultaneously implanted in the same mouse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Tumor volume was measured once a week, starting 8 days (1 w) after subcutaneous implantation of tumor cells. As we continued to monitor tumor growth during the following weeks, we were able to detect marked increases in tumor volume on both sides; tumors induced by uninfected control OSC-20 cells were significantly larger than those induced by <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>&#x02013;infected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The slower tumor growth observed with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>&#x02013;infected cells indicated that chronic infection with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> could slow tumor growth in an OSCC xenograft mouse model. At Thirty-five days after inoculation, the tumor masses were excised, sectioned, and stained with H &#x00026; E. These sections displayed histopathologic findings of OSCC, with prominent central necrosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, left panels). At high magnification, the OSCC cells showed marked pleomorphism, little keratin production, and high mitotic activity, which are characteristics of moderately differentiated OSCC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, right panels). There was no definitive difference in histologic grade or morphological features between tumors induced by uninfected and <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>&#x02013;infected OSC-20 cells.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Tumor mass growth was slowed in OSCC cells with a sustained <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infection</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> OSC-20 OSCC cells were infected with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> at a MOI of 100 for 2 h and cultured for an additional 24 h.

The Notch signaling pathway is known to play a critical role in maintaining the CSC population [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, we investigated the expression of cleaved Notch1 (Notch intracellular domain, NICD), its active form, in OSC-20 cells chronically infected with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. As expected, protein levels of NICD were significantly increased over time in OSC-20 cells with a <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In addition, increased levels of NICD in <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>&#x02013;infected cells were observed in other types of OSCC cells lines (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Such activation of Notch1 in infected OSC-20 cells was further confirmed with significant stimulation of CSL promoter activity detected by a luciferase assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), as well as changes in the mRNA levels of <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hey1</italic>, putative downstream targets of active Notch1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, middle and right panels).

When we first examined cellular toxicity to Taxol in na&#x000ef;ve OSC-20 cells, their viability was gradually decreased in a dose-dependent manner at both 24 and 48 h of Taxol incubation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Importantly, NICD-overexpressing OSC-20 cells exhibited higher viability than control cells transfected with an empty vector in the presence of Taxol. Such resistance to Taxol toxicity was prominent 24 h following a drug treatment, but not at a later time point (48 h) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This is an interesting parallel to our previous finding that indicated reduced susceptibility to Taxol in Ca9-22 cells, another OSCC cell, upon chronic exposure to <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. Moreover, these findings led to the hypothesis that <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> contributes to and induces activation of Notch1 that leads to the development of Taxol resistance in various OSCC cells.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Overexpression of NICD decreases Taxol-induced cell death in OSCC cells</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Cells were treated with various concentrations of Taxol (0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 nM) for 24 or 48 h and then subjected to an MTT assay. <bold>(B)</bold> Cell viability was analyzed in Taxol-exposed cells pretreated with or without NICD transfection. <bold>(C)</bold> OSC-20 cells with a sustained <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infection and uninfected OSC-20 cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right and left flanks, respectively, of nude mice.

Application of Taxol (10 mg/kg) or vehicle via intraperitoneal injections was initiated 14 days after tumor inoculation and was continued twice a week for a 4-week period. When OSC-20&#x02013;induced tumors were compared between <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>&#x02013;infected and control xenografts following repeated Taxol treatment, we found a greater increase in size associated with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infection, albeit smaller initial measurements before application of Taxol (N = 6, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, left panel). In addition, the suppressive effect of Taxol on the growth rate of tumors was significantly greater in control xenografts, as compared with that of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>&#x02013;infected OSC-20 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, right panel), indicating lower sensitivity to Taxol in <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>&#x02013;infected tumor xenografts.

Briefly, BALB/c mice were administered injections of OSC-20 cells (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) into their tail vein and sacrificed 30 days later for removal of major organs including the lungs, liver, and kidneys to evaluate distant metastasis of OSC-20 cells. When metastatic lesions were detected, they were localized exclusively to the lung surface, sparing the liver and kidneys. The size of metastatic foci was variable, ranging from microscopic lesions that were not readily detected in gross specimens (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, middle panels) to large nodules that replaced large portions of the lung lobes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, right panels). Indeed, the repetitive exposure of OSC-20 cells to <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> for 5 weeks resulted in metastatic foci in the lung tissues of all mice tested (six out of six). Importantly, four of six mice exhibited the formation of macronodules. In contrast, only one mouse injected with uninfected OSC-20 cells developed macronodules in the lungs. As a result, a fewer number of metastatic foci had formed in mice injected with uninfected OSC-20 cells than in mice injected with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>&#x02013;infected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). In addition to metastatic foci, the mice injected with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>&#x02013;infected OSC-20 cells showed higher serum levels of human MMPs including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-10, in contrast to low to nearly undetectable MMPs in mice injected with uninfected OSC-20 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Such low MMP levels may reflect the limited invasive ability of uninfected OSC-20 cells or alternatively reflect a reduced amount of MMPs released from only a few microscopic metastatic lesions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>While acceleration of tumor growth by inflammation-driven mechanisms is well established [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], our understanding of tumor cell responses to microbial infection&#x02013;induced inflammation can be complicated by multiple factors, including the types of host tumor cells and status of bacterial cells and/or host tumor cells. For example, previous studies have reported that live and heat-killed <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infections promoted host cell survival and cellular apoptosis, respectively [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In other studies, live <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> induced apoptosis in trophoblasts but enhanced proliferation in gingival epithelial cells by modulating cell cycle progression [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Considering these complex results, no clear conclusion has been drawn at this moment on the response of tumor cells to <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infection.</p><p>There have been only a few <italic>in vivo</italic> studies that investigated the effect of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> on tumor growth. According to one of these studies, growth of C26 colon carcinoma was accelerated by a <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> GroEL treatment in BALB/c mice [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis indicated that a transient <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infection suppressed host cell proliferation in Ca9-22 OSCC cells by inducing G1 arrest and autophagy [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, we have reported the reduced proliferation of Ca9-22 OSCC cells resulting from a prolonged and repeated infection with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> that mimicked chronic inflammation [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A similar suppressive effect was also found with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> in this study, as evidenced by reduced tumor growth in BALB/c xenograft mice harboring OSC-20 OSCC cells that were chronically infected with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. It is possible that soluble factors released from <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> may promote cell proliferation and contribute to tumor growth, but <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> itself may suppress proliferation of oral cancer cells and tumor mass growth, potentially by cell cycle arrest and autophagy, as we reported, or by residual immune reaction to signals from <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> in BALB/c mice.</p><p>In addition to its effect on tumor growth, our previous report demonstrated that prolonged and repeated infection with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> induced epithelial mesenchymal transition and resistance to Taxol and slowed proliferation cycles in OSCC cells. The cells also displayed higher expression levels of CD44 and CD133, representative indicators for cancer stemness [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A number of signaling cascades, including the Notch1 pathway, have been recently linked to formation of CSCs, development of chemoresistance, and acquisition of an epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our findings of enhanced NICD signaling in OSCC cells induced by chronic <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), as well as decreased sensitivity of NICD-overexpressing OSCC cells to Taxol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), suggest that chronic <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infection plays an important role in allowing OSCC cells to develop chemoresistance in a Notch1-dependent manner. In addition, enhanced sensitivity of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>&#x02013;infected tumor xenografts to combinations of Taxol and DAPT, an inhibitor of Notch activation, further supports that the Notch signaling pathway has a central role in mediating the chemoresistance of chronically infected oral cancer cells.</p><p>Our results are in line with other studies that demonstrated the critical role of the Notch signaling pathway in the regulation of CSCs and chemoresistance [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Recent reports have also demonstrated the enhanced efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs including docetaxel and paclitaxel when combined with DAPT in prostate cancer xenograft models and all platinum-resistant ovarian tumors, respectively [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While these findings suggest the need of combined Notch inhibition to improve efficacy of various chemotherapeutic reagents, whether a similar approach can be directly applied to target chronically inflamed cancer, especially periodontitis-associated oral cancer has never been examined. To our knowledge, our current results from both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses present the first experimental evidence supporting the usefulness of Notch inhibition in concert with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy to effectively cure chronically inflamed OSCC in the presence of periodontitis-causing pathogens.</p><p>Experimental evidence from mouse cancer models and human cancer studies has demonstrated the tight association of chronic inflammation with tumorigenesis and tumor progression. However, our current understanding regarding inflammation in a metastatic cascade is mainly restricted to the effects of inflammatory mediators on metastasis, including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1 beta, and TGF-beta, as well as relevant molecular mechanisms [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A limited number of experimental studies have demonstrated the effect of bacterial infection on cancer metastasis with metastatic tumor growth promoted by the administration of bacterial LPS in mice [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It remains unknown whether bacterial pathogens such as <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> can directly influence the metastatic progression of oral cancer. A recent report indicated that a chronic infection involving <italic>P. gingivalis/Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> through oral administration markedly enhanced the invasiveness of chemically induced OSCC in mice [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Herein, we presented the first experimental and molecular evidence demonstrating that OSCC combined with repetitive <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infections resembling chronic periodontitis developed higher metastatic potential through the activation of the Notch signaling pathway, a key molecular player modulating the EMT and tumor angiogenesis. Thus, our findings may provide a rationale for a combined therapeutic approach in patients with oral cancer consisting of anti-inflammatory regimens and periodontitis treatments along with chemotherapy to decrease the pro-metastatic activity of chronically inflamed cancer cells.</p><p>In summary, we presented <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental evidence supporting the idea that sustained infection with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, a major pathogen responsible for chronic periodontitis, promotes distant metastasis of oral cancer, as well as its resistance to anti-cancer agents. Our results suggest that resolution of chronic periodontitis may serve as a promising therapeutic target for metastatic and chemoresistant oral cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cancer cell and bacterial cultures</title><p>The human OSCC cell line, OSC-20, was cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (DME/F12; Hyclone, Logan, UT), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO), streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/mL), and amoxicillin and penicillin (100 IU/mL) (Gibco&#x02013;Invitrogen Corporation, Rockville, MD) at 37 &#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.
