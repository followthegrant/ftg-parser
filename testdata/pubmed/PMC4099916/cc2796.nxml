A recalibrated version, PIM 2, has recently been published. Although released in 2003, PIM 2 was derived from data collected between 1998 and 1999. We aimed to assess temporal changes in performance of both of these scores. Specifically, we hypothesised that the 6-year period between commencement of data collection (1998) and publication (2003) of the revised PIM 2 score may have allowed for significant decalibration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective data collection from a single, 20-bed tertiary PICU over 5 years (1999&#x02013;2003). The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated using the standard formula, discrimination assessed via the area under the receiver&#x02013;operating characteristic curve (ROC), and calibration using the Hosmer&#x02013;Lemeshow goodness of fit test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Scores were calculated for 4183 patient episodes (average 800&#x02013;900 admissions/year). There was no significant temporal variation in either case mix (cardiac surgery 27&#x02013;31%) or disease severity (data not shown). Both scores discriminated well, consistently yielding an area under the ROC curve &#x0003e; 0.75 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> top). Not surprisingly, PIM demonstrated a loss of calibration (Hosmer&#x02013;Lemeshow &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>&#x0003e; 15.5, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003e; 0.05) from 2000 onwards. PIM 2 also showed a temporal trend towards decalibration that became apparent by 2003. This trend was mirrored by a progressive reduction in SMR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> bottom), such that the upper confidence limit for the PIM 2 SMR was less than 1.00 by 2002. Interestingly, the SMR derived from either score decreased at a similar rate, 0.07&#x02013;0.08 per year.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="cc2796-1"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both scores continue to discriminate well between survival and nonsurvival. As expected, PIM 2 is better calibrated than PIM, although both appear to be decalibrating at a similar rate. Because PIM 2 reflects the 1998&#x02013;1999 standard of care, many PICUs will currently exhibit fewer deaths than expected (SMR &#x0003c; 1.00). More frequent calibration appears necessary.</p></sec></body></article>
