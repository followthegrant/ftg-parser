The seed oil from camelina has been converted to jet fuel and improved fuel efficiency in commercial and military test flights. Hydrogenation-derived renewable diesel from camelina is environmentally superior to that from canola due to lower agricultural inputs, and the seed meal is FDA approved for animal consumption. However, relatively low yield makes its farming less profitable. Our study is aimed at increasing camelina seed yield by reducing carbon loss from photorespiration via a photorespiratory bypass. Genes encoding three enzymes of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> glycolate catabolic pathway were introduced: glycolate dehydrogenase (GDH), glyoxylate carboxyligase (GCL) and tartronic semialdehyde reductase (TSR). These enzymes compete for the photorespiratory substrate, glycolate, convert it to glycerate within the chloroplasts, and reduce photorespiration. As a by-product of the reaction, CO<sub>2</sub> is released in the chloroplast, which increases photosynthesis. Camelina plants were transformed with either partial bypass (GDH), or full bypass (GDH, GCL and TSR) genes. Transgenic plants were evaluated for physiological and metabolic traits.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Expressing the photorespiratory bypass genes in camelina reduced photorespiration and increased photosynthesis in both partial and full bypass expressing lines. Expression of partial bypass increased seed yield by 50&#x02013;57&#x000a0;%, while expression of full bypass increased seed yield by 57&#x02013;73&#x000a0;%, with no loss in seed quality. The transgenic plants also showed increased vegetative biomass and faster development; they flowered, set seed and reached seed maturity about 1&#x000a0;week earlier than WT. At the transcriptional level, transgenic plants showed differential expression in categories such as respiration, amino acid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism. The increased growth of the bypass transgenics compared to WT was only observed in ambient or low CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, but not in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The photorespiratory bypass is an effective approach to increase photosynthetic productivity in camelina. By reducing photorespiratory losses and increasing photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rates, transgenic plants show dramatic increases in seed yield.

The plant is an attractive crop for sustainable biofuel production on marginal lands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Its seeds contain about 40&#x000a0;% oil by weight (twice that of soybean seeds) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which can be readily converted to industrial lubricants, biodiesel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and jet fuel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The camelina seed meal is FDA approved for animal consumption. However, camelina plants have a relatively low seed yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and are therefore currently not profitable enough in cultivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Increasing seed yield of any oil crop will reduce the competition for land with food and feed production and conservation. We have addressed this issue by increasing yield through reducing photorespiratory carbon and energy losses.</p><p>Photorespiration is caused by the oxygenase activity of the CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). In C3 plants such as camelina, RuBisCO catalyzes the reaction of CO<sub>2</sub> with the five carbon sugar phosphate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RUBP) about 75&#x000a0;% of the time to generate two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). The other 25&#x000a0;% of the time, RuBisCO catalyzes the reaction of O<sub>2</sub> with RUBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] to generate one molecule of 3-PGA and one molecule of phosphoglycolate (2-PG) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). 3-PGA is used in the chloroplast for RUBP regeneration or is diverted towards starch or sucrose synthesis. 2-PG is a toxic metabolite which inhibits photosynthesis in the chloroplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To avoid this detrimental effect, 2-PG is converted to glycolate, which is transported to the peroxisomes, and via photorespiration, the two molecules of 2-PG eventually form one molecule of 3-PGA at the loss of one molecule of CO<sub>2</sub> through mitochondria. Therefore, while the carboxylase activity of RuBisCO leads to carbon fixation, the oxygenase activity causes carbon loss. In addition, each round of photorespiration generates one molecule each of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>, both of which are toxic and require energy for their metabolism. In terms of the energy cost, photorespiration increases the cost of photosynthetic carbon fixation by about 50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Overview of the photorespiratory bypass. <italic>RuBisCO</italic> ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, <italic>RuBP</italic> ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, <italic>PGP</italic> phosphoglycolate phosphatase, <italic>GDH</italic> glycolate dehydrogenase, <italic>GCL</italic> glyoxylate carboxyligase, <italic>TSR</italic> tartronic semialdehyde reductase.

Mutants in photorespiratory pathway genes are often lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Synthetic metabolic pathways that bypass photorespiration, but do not eliminate it, have been shown to reduce photorespiratory carbon loss and thereby increase photosynthetic efficiency and biomass yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The most effective of these different photorespiratory bypasses is the one described by the Peterhansel group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Kebeish and coworkers introduced three enzymes from the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> glycolate catabolic pathway into <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> chloroplasts to create this photorespiratory bypass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this pathway (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), glycolate was oxidized to glyoxylate in the chloroplasts by the bacterial glycolate dehydrogenase (GDH). Then, two molecules of the 2-carbon glyoxylate were converted by glyoxylate carboxyligase (GCL) to a three-carbon tartronic semialdehyde (TSA) releasing one CO<sub>2</sub> inside the chloroplast. The tartronic semialdehyde is converted to glycerate by the enzyme tartronic semialdehyde reductase (TSR) to re-enter photosynthesis. There are several advantages to this approach. First, it generates a competing pathway for the plant photorespiratory cycle, as shown by the reduced glycine/serine ratios in transgenic plants expressing the bypass genes. Second, the CO<sub>2</sub> from glyoxylate is released directly inside the chloroplasts for re-fixation by RuBisCO. Expression of the photorespiratory bypass genes resulted in significant increases in photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub>-fixation and consequently biomass accumulation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the full bypass, partial bypass comprising of GDH alone was also found to be successful in increasing photosynthesis and biomass production in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and potato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. GDH expression increases glyoxylate content in chloroplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Independent reports from literature indicate that isolated wild-type chloroplasts from various species can metabolize glycolate as well as glyoxylate to release CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], but the related enzymes are not yet identified. While there is evidence that in isolated chloroplasts, glyoxylate can reduce or even inhibit photosynthesis by inhibiting RuBisCO activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], excess glyoxylate in leaf disks was found to promote photosynthesis and reduce photorespiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In an attempt to investigate methods to reduce photorespiration and increase photosynthetic productivity, Oliver and Zeleitch found that tobacco leaf disks floated on 5&#x02013;25&#x000a0;mM potassium glyoxylate (pH 4.6) showed doubling of <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> evolution in light by 57&#x000a0;% and reduction in glycolate concentration by 40&#x02013;60&#x000a0;%. These results indicated that glyoxylate acts to increase photosynthesis primarily by decreasing glycolate formation and photorespiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In another report, incubating soybean mesophyll cells with glyoxylate increased photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by 150&#x000a0;%, and inhibited CO<sub>2</sub> incorporation in glycolate and glycine by 71&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. While the mechanism of this inhibition is unknown, GDH overexpression in chloroplasts of partial and full bypass expressing plants reduced photorespiration, increased photosynthesis and increased biomass fixation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by 80&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and in potato by up to 131&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>We introduced this photorespiratory bypass into camelina to increase photosynthetic efficiency and decrease CO<sub>2</sub> loss by photorespiration. We introduced either a partial bypass (GDH only; DEF2 lines) or the full bypass (GDH, GCL and TSR; DEF2+TG1 lines) into camelina with the enzymes targeted to the chloroplasts. Transgenic plants expressing both partial and full bypass genes had reduced levels of photorespiration, increased photosynthesis rates and increased vegetative biomass. The research presented here indicates that the expression of photorespiratory bypass is a successful approach towards increasing crop productivity and seed yield in the biofuel crop camelina.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Introduction of photorespiratory bypass genes into <italic>Camelina sativa</italic></title><p>For the catabolic conversion of glycolate to glycerate and CO<sub>2</sub> in chloroplasts (photorespiratory bypass, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), genes encoding three bacterial enzymes&#x02014;GDH, GCL and TSR were introduced into <italic>C. sativa</italic> nuclear genome and the proteins were targeted to chloroplasts. The bacterial sequences were codon-optimized for expressing in plants (GenBank: KP967458-KP967462). The first step of the photorespiratory bypass is the oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate. This step is catalyzed by the enzyme glycolate dehydrogenase (GDH), containing three subunits, GlcD, GlcE and GlcF (construct DEF2, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The second step involves ligation of two glyoxylate molecules to form a 3-carbon tartronic semialdehyde (TSA) and the release of a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule. This conversion is catalyzed by glyoxylate carboxyligase (GCL). The third step involves conversion of TSA to glycerate by tartronic semialdehyde reductase (TSR). The gene constructs of GCL and TSR are included in vector TG1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Plants were either transformed with DEF2 (DEF2 lines; partial bypass), TG1 (TG1 lines) or co-transformed with DEF2 and TG1 constructs together (DEF2+TG1 lines; full bypass). The integration and expression of the transgenes in plants was verified by PCR using gDNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) and cDNA templates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Using PCR, we were able to isolate homozygous lines for all the three combinations&#x02014;DEF2, TG1 and DEF2+TG1. In T<sub>3</sub> homozygous plants, the protein expression of the transgenes was quantified by ELISA with antibodies specific to each protein. Green leaves of 3-week-old plants were used to quantify bypass proteins. On average, in DEF2 transgenics, GlcD expression was detected to be 0.76&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g fresh weight (FW), GlcE was 0.61&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g FW, and GlcF was 0.89&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g FW. On average, in TG1 plants, the expression of GCL was 5.7&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g FW and TSR was 11.8&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g FW (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). The catalytic activity of the bypass enzymes was evaluated by isolating the chloroplasts from transgenic and WT plants, and using chloroplast extracts to perform enzymatic assays. The activity of GDH was determined by measuring glyoxylate generation after feeding chloroplast extracts with glycolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Chloroplasts from DEF2 and DEF2+TG1 transgenics showed 65&#x02013;120&#x000a0;% higher GDH activity than WT chloroplasts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d).

The amount of glycine and serine in leaves is indicative of the carbon flux through photorespiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]; higher ratios of glycine/serine are related to higher RUBP oxygenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We investigated the glycine/serine ratio in leaves of DEF2 and DEF2+TG1 transgenics. Samples were taken in photorespiratory conditions (high light, about 5&#x000a0;h after dawn; day samples), and non-photorespiratory conditions (1&#x000a0;h before dawn; night samples). In the day samples, glycine/serine ratio was reduced by 23&#x000a0;% in DEF2 and 27&#x000a0;% in DEF2+TG1 plants. There were no differences in glycine/serine ratio between the night time samples. We further investigated whether the bypass-related CO<sub>2</sub> evolution in chloroplasts improved plant photosynthesis.

Because of this dramatic increase in leaf size, we undertook an anatomical examination of transgenic and WT leaves.

Given the average observed increases in leaf area of 30&#x02013;48&#x000a0;%, it suggests that the increase in leaf area in the transgenic lines compared to WT does not involve increase in cell division, but may fully be explained by increased cell size.

While seed yield data from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are not available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], in camelina, expression of both partial and full bypass increased seed yield, number of siliques formed per plant and the transgenics flowered about a week earlier than WT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The reduced glycine/serine pools in transgenic plants indicate that the photorespiratory carbon flux has also been reduced. However, further investigation is required to ascertain which aspect of the photorespiratory pathway is affected. First, biochemical models of leaf photosynthesis can be used to determine the CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure in WT, DEF2 and DEF2+TG1 chloroplasts at which the RuBisCO carboxylation rate approaches the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> loss by photorespiration (CO<sub>2</sub> photocompensation point).

Such a phenotype may be caused by a difference in stomatal aperture: WT had to keep the aperture fully open to gain more CO<sub>2</sub> but lost more water at the same time, while the transgenic plants did not have to do so due to a higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentration inside the chloroplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In DEF2+TG1 plants, high chloroplastic CO<sub>2</sub> levels can be attributed to the enzyme GCL, which converts glyoxylate into tartronic semialdehyde in the chloroplasts and releases CO<sub>2</sub> as a result. However, it remains to be elucidated why DEF2 plants, which only express the GDH enzyme, show a similar phenotype.</p><p>The increased glyoxylate generation in DEF2 plants can either be transported to peroxisomes for processing or it may be catabolized within the chloroplasts. While the pathways involved in the plastid metabolism of glyoxylate are not yet identified, previous research indicates that isolated WT chloroplasts can metabolize glyoxylate to release CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Blume et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] observed that pyruvate can inhibit glyoxylate-dependent CO<sub>2</sub> evolution. Because pyruvate and glyoxylate have similar chemical structures, they may compete for the binding site of the plastidic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. PDC has thus been cited as one of the enzymes that may be able to decarboxylate glyoxylate in the chloroplasts for CO<sub>2</sub> evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, this or related pathways of glycolate and/or glyoxylate catabolism in chloroplasts may not exclusively account for the increased photosynthetic productivity of GDH-expressing plants. In leaf disks, excess glyoxylate was found to increase <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by 1.2&#x02013;2.3 fold, and decrease glycolate concentration and photorespiratory CO<sub>2</sub> evolution by more than 50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is possible that GDH-expressing plants, such as the DEF2 plants in this report and in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] take advantage of these unknown pathways and exhibit increased photosynthesis and reduced photorespiration by a two-faceted approach in the chloroplast competing for glycolate as a substrate to form glyoxylate, and a glyoxylate inhibition of glycolate production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While the alternate pathway for glyoxylate catabolism is not well understood, it seems to increase chloroplast CO<sub>2</sub> levels in DEF2 chloroplasts and increase photosynthesis, just as GCL seems to increase CO<sub>2</sub> levels in DEF2+TG1 chloroplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In agreement with this hypothesis, bypass transgenics show growth phenotypes conditional on the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of the air in which they grow.</p><p>Previous research has shown that plants grown in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions have increased respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In soybean plants grown in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (560&#x000a0;ppm), Leakey and coworkers reported that photosynthesis increased by about 20&#x000a0;%, generating more photosynthetic storage products such as starch. They also reported increased dark respiration and postulated that it was a mechanism to increase starch degradation at night, which prevented excess starch accumulation in leaves at dawn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Bypass expressing camelina plants showed a similar phenotype as the &#x0201c;high-CO<sub>2</sub>&#x0201d; grown soybean plants. The accumulation of starch in the light period was more than twice that of WT camelina plants and was completely utilized by the end of the dark phase. Bypass expressing plants also showed higher pre-dawn respiration rates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>b). Consistent with this observation, in our sequencing data, expression of respiration-related genes was affected. For example, the respiration complex cytochrome b-c1 was expressed at higher levels in the bypass expressing plants compared to WT plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>a). The transcript profiles suggest that the accumulation of starch in the DEF2+TG1 lines was most likely due to a reduction of starch turnover during the light. Transcripts of starch degrading enzymes such as glucan:water dikinase and isoamylase were significantly lower in the DEF2+TG1 lines compared to WT. The higher starch levels in the leaves of the bypass plants could indicate increased internode elongation during the dark phase. The elevated respiration is fueled by starch degradation and provides the energy (ATP) for sucrose export to the phloem. Sucrose export costs account for about 30&#x000a0;% of the dark respiration rate in mature leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], so in our fully grown camelina leaves, the increased amounts of starch and correlating increases in dark respiration suggest increased sucrose export via the phloem during the night&#x02014;again correlating with increased growth rates during the dark phase.</p><p>Because the full bypass and the partial bypass with the alternate pathway may both release CO<sub>2</sub> in chloroplasts, but may generate different intermediate and end products, we observe similarities as well as differences in phenotypes and transcript abundances between DEF2 and DEF2+TG1 plants. Genes that are affected in their transcript abundance between the DEF2 plants and DEF2+TG1 transgenics could offer a clue to potential pathways and players involved. Although several of those genes are not yet characterized (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>a, b, <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>), transcripts encoding enzymes functional in terpene biosynthesis (cineole-synthase&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase; and cytosolic ACCases) as well as enzymes involved in plastidic fatty acid biosynthesis (pyruvate kinase, plastid ACCase) suggest a possible allocation of assimilated carbon through plastidic lipid metabolism in DEF2+TG1 plants. There was increased transcript abundance for multiple sugar transporter genes in DEF2 and DEF2+TG1 plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>b). Accumulation of sucrose in source cells can cause feedback inhibition of photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Overexpression of sugar transporters in bypass transgenics may have increased the efficiency of export of sugars (sucrose) via phloem to sink tissues. This could help in increasing seed yields, as well as further improving photosynthetic efficiency by relieving the feedback inhibition of photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. As a corollary to that, transgenic overexpression of known sugar transporters may further remove sucrose build-up, and may increase photosynthesis even more in bypass transgenics.</p><p>An interesting difference in the results from our study compared to the previously reported effects of plants grown in high CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] or plants expressing photorespiratory bypasses using bacterial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or plant genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] is the change in leaf phenotype. Previous studies with plants expressing photorespiratory bypasses reported development of larger, lighter colored and thinner leaves in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In contrast, bypass transgenics in camelina had larger leaves and similar chlorophyll content as WT leaves (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure&#x000a0;S1). While the leaves were larger, they were not noticeably thinner. In the mesophyll of bypass leaves, the cells were more loosely arranged, with fewer but larger mesophyll cells per unit area than WT leaves which had more tightly packed, smaller mesophyll cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f). One possible reason for this difference in leaf anatomy could be species related. Another could be developmental constraints on the number of cells formed within the leaf, or an extended cell elongation stage. Indeed, the difference between the cellular distribution in bypass transgenics compared to WT is reminiscent of older leaves near the end of elongation stage compared with younger leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. As leaves expand, chloroplast surface area also increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Further, RuBisCO levels have been reported to correlate with total chloroplast volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], and leaf photosynthesis per unit area correlates linearly with increasing RuBisCO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Analysis of whether larger cells in bypass transgenics have a higher number of chloroplasts, whether the chloroplasts are larger in size, and measurements of overall RuBisCO content would be necessary to correlate the anatomical data with increased photosynthesis per unit area in the bypass plants. It also remains to be investigated whether the larger leaves in camelina bypass transgenics shade lower leaves and prevent them from reaching their highest photosynthetic potential in field conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p><p>Another area that must be investigated in future studies is the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of bypass transgenics. Because the photorespiratory bypass reduces carbon flux through photorespiration, it also reduces the release of ammonia from glycine catabolism and re-fixation into glutamine. Therefore, plants expressing the photorespiratory bypass are predicted to have an increase of 15&#x000a0;% in NUE, although this has never been tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. NUE is defined as the proportion of all nitrogen inputs that are accumulated by the plant in biomass and seed, as well as nitrogen that is recycled by plant residue into the soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. NUE of a plant affects both the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied, as well as potential recycling of nitrogen into the soil. In Arkansas rice fields, it was observed that about 18&#x000a0;% of variable productions costs could be attributed to nitrogen fertilizer and its application, making it one of the largest expenses in the grain production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Therefore, NUE is an important feature for optimization of &#x02018;benefit to cost ratio&#x02019; of a crop plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], and may be an advantage of bypass plants. An increase in leaf nitrogen content can cause the formation of larger chloroplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] while increasing <italic>V</italic><sub>cmax</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and further increasing photosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Camelina is a biofuel crop with a great potential. By increasing photosynthetic productivity, the strategy of photorespiratory bypass could have a significant economic impact for camelina production, by not only increasing seed oil and meal harvested per acre of land, but also by reducing crop cycle time and thereby reducing input resources of land and labor. Because photorespiration is a cause of carbon loss in most C3 plants, this strategy may be applied to other agriculturally important C3 crops, such as rice and soybean. The aspect of increasing nitrogen use efficiency is one that if realized in bypass expressing plants as predicted, would lead to significant reduction in fertilizer application, and lower the environmental cost of agriculture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Gene synthesis, optimization and cloning</title><p>The photorespiratory bypass genes used in the experiments originated from the <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 genome (strain MG1655) available on the NCBI website (gi49175990).
