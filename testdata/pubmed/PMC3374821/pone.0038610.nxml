In agreement with an embodied cognition viewpoint, a hypothesis has been advanced that gestures and language form a single communication system and words whose retrieval is facilitated by gestures are semantically represented through sensory-motor features. However, it is still an open question as to what extent this treatment approach works. Results from the recovery of motor deficits have suggested that action observation promotes motor recovery only for actions that are part of the motor repertoire of the observer. The aim of the present experiment was to further investigate the role of action observation treatment in verb recovery. In particular, we contrasted the effects induced by observing human actions (e.g. dancing, kicking, pointing, eating) versus non human actions (e.g. barking, printing). Seven chronic aphasic patients with a selective deficit in verb retrieval underwent an intensive rehabilitation training that included five daily sessions over two consecutive weeks. Each subject was asked to carefully observe 115 video-clips of actions, one at a time and, after observing them, they had to produce the corresponding verb. Two groups of actions were randomly presented: humans versus nonhuman actions. In all patients, significant improvement in verb retrieval was found only by observing video-clips of human actions. Moreover, follow-up testing revealed long-term verb recovery that was still present two months after the two treatments had ended. In support of the multimodal concept representation's proposal, we suggest that just the observation of actions pertaining to the human motor repertoire is an effective rehabilitation approach for verb recovery.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well known that in aphasic patients word-finding difficulties are the most pervasive symptom of language breakdown. Different rehabilitation therapies based either on the simple use of gesture <xref rid="pone.0038610-Hanlon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038610-Pashek1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> or on gestures paired with verbal production <xref rid="pone.0038610-PasheK1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038610-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> have been proposed. In a work by Hanlon et al. <xref rid="pone.0038610-Hanlon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, the effect of different unilateral gestural movements on naming to confrontation were examined. Results showed that activating the hemiplegic right arm to execute a communicative but non-representational pointing gesture facilitated aphasics' naming abilities. Raimer et al. <xref rid="pone.0038610-Raimer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> examined the effect of gestural treatments using pantomimes paired with verbal training for noun and verb retrieval in a group of aphasic patients. Results showed a specific improvement in naming trained nouns and verbs but not in untrained words.</p><p>According to these data, gestures and speech are two separate domains. Gestures might interact either at an early stage, when the message to be conveyed is being prepared for linguistic formulation (&#x0201c;conceptual gestures&#x0201d;) or during later stages, when the retrieval of lexical items momentary fails (&#x0201c;lexical gestures&#x0201d;) <xref rid="pone.0038610-Hanlon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038610-Hadar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038610-Krauss1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>More recently, a different interpretation has been proposed <xref rid="pone.0038610-Krauss2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In agreement with an embodied cognition viewpoint <xref rid="pone.0038610-Barsalou1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038610-Gallese1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, some authors have suggested that gesture and speech are strongly connected to the same conceptual representation. Words whose retrieval is facilitated by gestures are more likely to be analogically encoded in a multimodal representation including sensory-motor features <xref rid="pone.0038610-Krauss2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038610-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The more a word is grounded in sensory-motor features, the more the real execution of the corresponding gesture will facilitate its retrieval <xref rid="pone.0038610-Krauss2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Very recently, Marangolo et al. <xref rid="pone.0038610-Marangolo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> presented data in favour of the embodied representation proposal, which did not confirm that intentionally performing a gesture prior to name <xref rid="pone.0038610-Krauss2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> is a necessary prerequisite for enhancing naming. The authors <xref rid="pone.0038610-Marangolo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> investigated whether the &#x0201c;observation of semantically congruent actions&#x0201d; and/or &#x0201c;the observation and execution of semantically congruent actions&#x0201d; would improve verb-finding difficulties in a group of six aphasic patients. Differently from most of the previous reports <xref rid="pone.0038610-PasheK1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038610-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, neither treatment was combined with verbal cues. Results showed a significant improvement in verb retrieval not only when subjects, prior to naming, were required to observe and then to execute the action performed by the examiner (&#x0201c;action observation and execution&#x0201d;), but also when they were required to simply observe the action (&#x0201c;action observation&#x0201d;). In both conditions, this improvement was still present two months after the two treatments ended. No significant effects were found in the control condition in which patients first observed the action performed by the examiner and then had to execute a meaningless movement. In short, results clearly showed that the simple observation of a semantically congruent action has reinforced verb retrieval in the same way as the actual execution of the action. Current views assume that a shared motor representation for the execution and observation of actions, the so-called &#x0201c;Mirror Neuron System&#x0201d;, is implicated in understanding others' actions by means of an automatic matching process that links observed and performed actions <xref rid="pone.0038610-Binkofski1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038610-Rizzolatti1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> In line with the Mirror Neuron hypothesis and the multimodal concept representation proposal <xref rid="pone.0038610-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, the authors argued that in their work the observation of the performed action was sufficient to activate in the semantic system its corresponding sensory-motor representation, which served as input at the lexical level facilitating verb retrieval <xref rid="pone.0038610-Marangolo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The role of action observation, as an effective strategy in neurorehabilitation, has been yet supported by several recent studies showing that action observation has a positive impact on recovery of motor deficits after stroke <xref rid="pone.0038610-Franceschini1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038610-Bellelli1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Ertelt et al. <xref rid="pone.0038610-Ertelt1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> combined observation of daily actions with concomitant physical training of the observed actions in eight stroke patients with moderate, chronic motor deficit of the upper limb. A control group of eight participants post-stroke paired motor training with observation of geometric symbols and letters. Significant functional improvement on standard scales occurred for combined action observation and motor training compared with controls despite a stable pre-training baseline. Very recently, these results were replicated in a larger group of twenty-eight participants with chronic upper limb motor deficits, a group affected by Parkinson's disease <xref rid="pone.0038610-Franceschini1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038610-Buccino1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and post-surgical orthopedic patients <xref rid="pone.0038610-Bellelli1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>However, it is still an open question as to what extent the Action Observation approach is really effective. It has been suggested that the Mirror Neuron System is indeed more strongly activated by actions that can be reproduced and are part of the motor repertoire of the observer. In an fMRI study, Buccino et al. <xref rid="pone.0038610-Buccino2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> investigated whether the observation of actions performed by nonconspecifics (e.g. monkey and dog) would activate the same cortical areas that are active when subjects observe actions made by humans. Results showed that when the observed action is common to animals and humans (e.g. biting), there is a clear overlap between the activated areas. In contrast, during the observation of an action that does not belong to humans (e.g. barking), there was a clear difference in the distribution and extent of activations. Similar results were obtained comparing familiar versus unfamiliar actions <xref rid="pone.0038610-CalvoMerino1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038610-Cross2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and human agents versus robotic agents <xref rid="pone.0038610-Tai1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038610-Shimada1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, even when all actions were matched for kinematics <xref rid="pone.0038610-Shimada1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038610-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

Although our data are strictly behavioural, we could speculate that the mechanism underlying this effect involves the Mirror Neuron System, which is equally active when actions are actually carried out and/or are simply observed <xref rid="pone.0038610-Binkofski1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038610-Rizzolatti1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Earlier studies have proposed that the Mirror Neuron System responds most robustly when watching familiar, executable actions made by conspecifics <xref rid="pone.0038610-Buccino2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Brain regions associated with the Mirror System show stronger responses to human actions than to animal actions <xref rid="pone.0038610-Buccino2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and to actions made by robots <xref rid="pone.0038610-Tai1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0038610-Shimada1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. These findings are consistent with the notion that observing actions with familiar kinematic features, which are within one's motor repertoire, result in greater Mirror Neuron involvement than observing less familiar actions. In line with most of the prior reports, we found that only human actions belonging to the sensory-motor experiential repertoire of the observer (e.g, dancing, eating) enhance verb recovery. These effects were consistently present even two months after the end of the treatment independently of the motor effectors (mouth, hand, foot, body) performing the action. We hypothesize that the observed familiar action exerts its influence at the semantic level because the sensory-motor representation, on which it is matched, produces an outcome that is known to the acting individual. Actions that are not part of the motor repertoire of the observer, such as natural (e.g, barking, raining) or mechanical actions (e.g., printing, digging) cannot make use of this matching process.</p><p>One final point regards a possible transfer of verb treatment effects in the language examination which would indicate a generalization of the recovery also in other tasks. Although only one patient made significant improvement in the verb naming task of the BADA test after the treatment, more interestingly, six out of seven patients showed a significant change in the description task with an increase in the use of verbs before and after the treatment. These different results might be due to the fact that while the verb naming task is administered using static and non-contextualised picture of actions, in the description task, verb production is more contextually-driven (e.g., the verb &#x0201c;to read&#x0201d; is presented in the context of a man who is reading a newspaper seated in an armchair) and therefore, in some ways, it better duplicates the situation used during the treatment (the video-clips presented were all contextually-driven).</p><p>In conclusion, our data clearly confirm that Action Observation Treatment is an useful rehabilitation strategy to promote a long-lasting recovery in verb production in aphasic patients. However, since the number of patients treated was small, the facilitation found between human and non human actions and their corresponding neural correlates deserve further investigations. We believe that these new findings open future directions for planning new therapeutic interventions for language rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0038610.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>
