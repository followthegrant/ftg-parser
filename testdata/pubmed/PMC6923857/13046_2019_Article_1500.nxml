It has been shown to bind to p53 protein in cell cytoplasm and nucleus causing inactivation of its tumor suppressor activity in cancer cells. Several other activities of mortalin including mitochondrial biogenesis, ATP production, chaperoning, anti-apoptosis contribute to pro-proliferative and migration characteristics of cancer cells. Mortalin-compromised cancer cells have been shown to undergo apoptosis in in vitro and in vivo implying that it could be a potential target for cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We implemented a screening of a chemical library for compounds with potential to abrogate cancer cell specific mortalin-p53 interactions, and identified a new compound (named it as Mortaparib) that caused nuclear enrichment of p53 and shift in mortalin from perinuclear (typical of cancer cells) to pancytoplasmic (typical of normal cells). Biochemical and molecular assays were used to demonstrate the effect of Mortaparib on mortalin, p53 and PARP1 activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Molecular homology search revealed that Mortaparib is a novel compound that showed strong cytotoxicity to ovarian, cervical and breast cancer cells. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that although Mortaparib could interact with mortalin, its binding with p53 interaction site was not stable. Instead, it caused transcriptional repression of mortalin leading to activation of p53 and growth arrest/apoptosis of cancer cells. By extensive computational and experimental analyses, we demonstrate that Mortaparib is a dual inhibitor of mortalin and PARP1. It targets mortalin, PARP1 and mortalin-PARP1 interactions leading to inactivation of PARP1 that triggers growth arrest/apoptosis signaling. Consistent with the role of mortalin and PARP1 in cancer cell migration, metastasis and angiogenesis, Mortaparib-treated cells showed inhibition of these phenotypes. In vivo tumor suppression assays showed that Mortaparib is a potent tumor suppressor small molecule and awaits clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">These findings report (i) the discovery of Mortaparib as a first dual inhibitor of mortalin and PARP1 (both frequently enriched in cancers), (ii) its molecular mechanism of action, and (iii) in vitro and in vivo tumor suppressor activity that emphasize its potential as an anticancer drug.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mortaparib</kwd><kwd>Mortalin</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>PARP1</kwd><kwd>Inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Growth arrest</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par22">Mortalin/GRP75/HSPA9/mthsp70 is a ubiquitously expressed member of heat shock protein 70 family of chaperones and has been established to play key roles in number of biological processes including cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, protein folding, chaperoning, intracellular trafficking, mitochondrial biogenesis, apoptosis and carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is overexpressed in almost all types of cancers and regulates several properties of cancer cells including anti-apoptosis, migration, invasion, metastasis and drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Mortalin was shown to inhibit tumor suppressor p53 function by interacting with it in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] as well as in nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], where it controls centrosome duplication, activates telomerase and hnRNPK yielding malignant properties of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Of note, mortalin-p53 interactions were shown to be specific to cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Consistently, mortalin shRNA caused apoptosis in hepatocarcinoma, but not in primary liver cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, some potential anticancer drugs were shown to activate p53 function and also caused shift in mortalin staining pattern from perinuclear (typical of cancer cells) to pancytoplasmic (typical of normal cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Gao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] showed that mortalin shRNA caused induction of DNA damage signaling, leading to growth arrest of cancer cells. Proteins such as PARP1, BRCA1, ATM, ATR, CHK1, CHK2, RAD9 and p53 regulate DNA damage response for the maintenance of genome integrity, and are often mutated or dysregulated in large variety of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Enforcement of DNA damage response by either the reconstitution of mutated DNA damage regulatory proteins or inhibition of repair signaling has been shown to cause growth arrest/apoptosis of cancer cells, and hence considered as a potential strategy for cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase (PARP)-1 is a 116-kDa nuclear protein that plays a key role in sensing DNA damage and its repair by recruitment of DNA repair machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It has also been shown to have function in various cellular contexts including metabolism, aging, inflammation, epigenetic modification, apoptosis and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Function of PARP1 for recruitment of DNA repair machinery has been shown to be dependent on its PARylation, addition of sugar moiety poly (ADP-ribosyl) (PAR), that requires NAD<sup>+</sup> and its removal by PARG (Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The latter is a nuclear and mitochondrial protein that removes PAR and restores PARP1 for next round of DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Olaparib, Niraparib, Rucaparib, Talazoparib and Veliparib are FDA approved drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] for PARP1 inhibition in BRCA1 mutated cancers. Currently, some other drug candidates, like simmiparib, are undergoing development in clinical phase trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] for assessing long term toxicity to many organs and resistance in clinical settings. Mechanistically, PARP1 inhibitors have been shown to compete with ligand NAD<sup>+</sup>, inhibit the PARylation of PARP1 or restoration by PARG enzyme resulting in increase in accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] leading to growth arrest/apoptosis in cancer cells. Components of DNA damage and oxidative signaling have been reported to mediate such growth arrest/apoptosis. These include activation of NFkB (Nuclear Factor kappa B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], Caspases, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) and p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In contrast to the NAD<sup>+</sup> dependent C-terminal inhibition of PARP1, DNA trapping mediated by its N-terminal has been reported as another independent way of its inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Olaparib, Simmiparib, Veliparib and MK4827 have been reported to cause N-terminal inhibition of PARP1 leading to growth arrest/apoptosis of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors have been shown to sensitize cancer cells to other anticancer drugs and hence deemed beneficial for combinatorial therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">By using abrogation of mortalin-p53 interaction as a screening assay, we isolated a compound (5-[1-(4-methoxyphenyl)(1,2,3,4-tetraazol-5-yl)]-4-phenylpyrimidine-2-ylamine; named Mortaparib) that causes nuclear enrichment and activation of p53 function through deregulation of mortalin. We found that the transcriptional repression of mortalin by Mortaparib caused inactivation of PARP1 leading to accumulation of DSB (Double-Strand Breaks) and apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. We present in silico and experimental evidences (in vitro and in vivo) for Mortaparib as a first potential dual inhibitor of mortalin and PARP1 for treatment of cervical and ovarian cancers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cells, plasmids and transfection</title><p id="Par25">Human normal cells (MRC5 and TIG3), cervical carcinoma (HeLa, ME180, SKG-II and SKG-IIIb), breast carcinoma (MCF7), osteosarcoma (U2OS), colorectal adenocarcinoma (DLD1), human lung carcinoma (A427 and A549), non-small lung cancer (NCI-H1299), ovarian cancer (SKOV3 and OVK 18&#x02013;1), human prostate cancer (PC3 and DU145), hepatoma (PLC) and human pancreatic (Suit-2) cancer cell lines were bought from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank (JCRB) or DS Pharma, Japan and grown in DMEM/RPMI/MEM medium-supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and incubated in a humidified incubator maintained at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.</p><p id="Par26">Cells stably expressing full-length mortalin protein were prepared, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

Although PARP1 is conventionally treated as a nuclear factor important for single strand DNA repair, several studies in the past have shown its occurrence in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. ADP-ribosyl transferase (ART), required for PARP1 function, was also shown to be present intact in submitochondrial fractionations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In view of this information and our data on the effect of Mortaparib on mortalin and PARP1, we predicted that these two proteins may interact either in nucleus and/or in mitochondria. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that mortalin and PARP1 possess potent interaction domains (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure&#x000a0;S5A). In addition, mortalin-interacting region of PARP1 was close to the one that interacted with Mortaparib (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure&#x000a0;S5A and B). The amino acid residues 71&#x02013;419 of PARP1 were predicted to be involved in its binding to mortalin. On the other hand, amino acid residues 42&#x02013;334 of mortalin interacted with PARP1. Mortaparib was predicted to bind to the carboxy terminus of PARP1 (662&#x02013;1014 aa) that was outside the direct binding region of PARP1 to mortalin. In order to test these predictions, we next performed co-immunoprecipitation of PARP1 and mortalin, and found that PARP1-immunocomplexes contained mortalin and vice versa (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f) demonstrating that these two proteins interact in cells. Of note, Mortaparib-treated cells showed decrease in both proteins and more so in their interaction as judged from immunocomplexes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). In order to validate the interactions further, we used COS7 cells expressing V5-tagged deletion mutants of mortalin. Immunoprecipiation with anti-PARP1 antibody revealed co-immunoprecipiation of V5-tagged deletion mutants of mortalin protein endorsing their interaction. Of note, some delection mutants did not co-precipiate and revealed that mortalin interacts with PARP1 by amino acid residues present in two domains (i) 1&#x02013;104 and (ii) 252&#x02013;390 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g).</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Mortalin overexpression and silencing affected PARP1 signaling</title><p id="Par55">In order to further support that mortalin-PARP1 interactions may be functionally relevant, we recruited overexpression and knock-down of mortalin and determined PARP1 activities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In order to overcome the effect of human papilloma virus (present in HeLa cells) on p53 activity, we used MCF7 cells for this assay. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, mortalin overexpressing cells, as expected, showed decrease in p53. Of note, increase in PARP1 was observed in these cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). On the other hand, mortalin compromised cells showed decrease in PARP1, increase in p53 and decrease in pro-caspase 3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). The data was confirmed by immunostaining with specific antibodies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). Furthermore, similar to Mortaparib-treated cells, mortalin shRNA-treated cells showed trapping of PARP1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). We also found that whereas cells overexpressing mortalin showed resistance to Mortaparib, mortalin-compromised cells were significantly sensitized to Mortaparib (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e and f). These data strongly supported that Mortaparib-induced inhibition of PARP1 signaling and apoptosis in cancer cells was mediated by targeting of mortalin.

Consistent with these phenotypes, molecular analyses showed down-regulation of proteins involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These included fibronectin, N-Cadherin, MMP2, MMP3, MMP-7, MMP-9, hnRNPK and vimentin in Mortaparib-treated cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d); E-cadherin, however, showed decrease.

In cancer cells enriched with mortalin expression, it has been shown to inactivate p53 tumor suppressor protein and activate others including telomerase and hnRNPK that promote cancerous properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Mortalin knockdown has earlier been reported to cause growth arrest, apopotosis, reversal of EMT and cancer cell stemness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hence, mortalin-targeting drugs have been deemed useful for cancer therapy. Differential subcellular distribution of mortalin in normal and cancer cells has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Furthermore, several studies showed that mortalin interacts with p53 in cancer cells, causing its cytoplasmic retention and inactivation of tumor suppressor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Small molecules that interfere with mortalin-p53 interaction, including MKT-077, Withaferin A and CAPE and specific anti-mortalin molecules (ribosomes, shRNA) were shown to activate p53 and resulting in growth arrest of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In view of these reports, we established a screening assay to visually detect activation of p53 (nuclear translocation) associated with shift in mortalin staining from perinuclear (cancer cells) to pancytoplasmic (normal cells) and screened a library of 12,000 small molecules. Mortaparib was selected as a strong candidate after four rounds of screening (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure&#x000a0;S1A and B). It showed cytotoxicity to a variety of cancer cells of which HeLa and SKOV3 showed strong response in many independent experiments (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure&#x000a0;S1C and D). At molecular level, we found that Mortaparib, not only leads to abrogation of mortalin-p53 interaction, nuclear translocation and activation of p53 activity but also downregulates mortalin at the transcriptional level. Mortalin has been reported for several functions that are essential for cell survival, maintainance of mitochondrial integrity, ATP generation and chaperoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Indeed, we found that Mortaparib treatment caused depolarization of mitochondria membrane, ROS activation and decrease in cellular ATP levels (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The latter is an important energy substrate and co-factor involved in post-translational modification (polyADP-ribosylation) and activation of PARP1, an essential step for PARP1-mediated DNA repair genomic stability and cell proliferation. PARP1 is often enriched in cancer cells and its inhibition has been shown to cause cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] making it an attractive target for cancer treatment. In recent years, PARP1 inhibitors have extensively been explored as anticancer drugs either as single agent or in combination with other conventional chemotherapeutic drugs for treatment of breast and ovarian cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. We next determined the effect of Mortaparib on PARP1 signaling. Indeed, Mortaparib-treated cells showed reduced PARP1 function, decrease in PAR and its trapping into DNA, resulting in accumulation of DSB (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In cell viability assays, Mortaparib showed cytotoxicity profile similar to that of Olaparib in various cell lines (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure&#x000a0;S2). In order to investigate the molecular link between mortalin and PARP1, we recruited mortalin overexpressing and compromised cells, and found an association between the two proteins. Whereas mortalin-overexpressing cells showed activated PARP1 signaling, its knockdown lead to decrease in PARP1 level as well as its downstream regulators evoking apoptosis. Furthermore, mortalin-compromised cells were found more sensitive to the Mortaparib treatment, as compared to overexpression derivatives (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). By co-immunoprecipitation, we found that PARP1 and mortalin proteins interact and these interactions are targeted by Mortaparib, as supported by molecular docking and experimental data (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures.&#x000a0;S4 and S5). p53 has been shown to interact with multiple proteins. Besides its interaction with PARP1, it has been identified as a substrate for covalent and non-covalent interaction with PAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Central and carboxy terminal region of p53 were found essential for interaction and complex formation with PARP1. Interestingly, we have previously reported that mortalin (residues 253&#x02013;282) binds to the carboxy terminal amino acid residues 312&#x02013;352 of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Co-immunoprecipitation of mortalin and PARP1, using the deletion mutants of mortalin, demonstrated that mortalin binds to PARP1 by two domains (amino acid residues 1&#x02013;104 and 252&#x02013;290). One of these includes p53 binding region. Taken together, these data suggested that Mortalin, p53 and PARP1 make tricomplex that may be abrogated by Mortaparib leading to functional activation of p53 and inactivation of PARP1. Indeed, Mortalin and PARP1 targeting by Mortaparib caused growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells, marked by activation of p53-p21<sup>WAF1</sup> and caspase signalings, respectively. Oxidative stress, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane and decrease in ATP signified apoptosis of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">Sub-toxic doses of Mortaparib showed significant inhibition of cell migration, invasion and angiogenic abilities in vitro as well as growth and metastasis in vivo (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) suggesting it to be a potent anti-tumor and anti-metastasis drug. Cells treated with Mortaparib showed decrease in N-Cadherin, MMP3, MMP2, MMP7, MMP9 and hnRNP-K. However, Mortaparib-induced decrease in cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis seems not to involve E-Cadherin as it remained unchanged. &#x003b3;H2AX is known as sensitive indicator of DNA double strand break and genotoxic stress. BRCA1 plays a major role in homologous recombination repair pathway and its knockdown results in steady increase in the level of &#x003b3;H2AX due to genotoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Of note, targeting mortalin and PARP1 by Mortaparib also caused decrease in BRCA1 that has earlier been shown to cause collateral lethality of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and increase in &#x003b3;H2AX protein. Ovarian and breast tumors with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are sensitive to the PARP1 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We found that Mortaparib-treated cells show remarkable decrease in BRCA1 and activated DNA damage signaling as signified by increase in &#x003b3;H2AX protein expression. These effects are likely to be mediated by inactivation of PARP1 and activation of p53 signaling by Mortaparib. Recently, Olaparib has been approved as the first PARP inhibitor in European Union and United States for the treatment of advanced BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Mortaparib may be another candidate drug for these cancers. Taken together, further studies are warranted to understand the molecular mechanisms of anticancer activity of Mortaparib and its clinical efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par59">Mortaparib inhibits mortalin and PARP1 resulting in activation of growth arrest and apoptosis signaling in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.
