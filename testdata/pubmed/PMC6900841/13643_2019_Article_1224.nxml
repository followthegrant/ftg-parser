Despite this observation, recent studies suggest that coercive measures, such as seclusion, restraints, involuntary hospitalization, or involuntary treatment, are steadily or increasingly being used without proof of their effectiveness. In nursing, several literature reviews have focused on understanding nurses&#x02019; perspectives on the use of seclusion and restraints. Although many studies describe the ethical dilemmas faced by nurses in this context, to this date, their perspectives on patient&#x02019;s rights when a broad variety of coercive measures are used are not well understood. The aim of this review is to produce a qualitative synthesis of how human rights are actually integrated into psychiatric and mental health nursing practice in the context of coercive work.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Noblit and Hare&#x02019;s meta-ethnographic approach will be used to conduct this systematic review.

Recent studies demonstrate that coercive measures, such as seclusion, physical or chemical restraints, involuntary treatment, and involuntary hospitalization, are steadily or increasingly being used in many jurisdictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] without clear evidence of their effectiveness when compared with treatments offered on a voluntary basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The Merriam Webster dictionary defines coercion as the act of &#x0201c;compel(ling) to an act or choice&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;achiev(ing) by force or threat&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Coercion can be either formal, informal, and/or perceived. Formal coercion refers to regulated, justified, and documented forms of coercion. Examples of formal coercion include involuntary hospitalization and/or treatment. Informal coercion refers to other forms of actions that use strategies to act against the patient&#x02019;s will that do not involve the use of legal provisions. Examples of informal coercion include threats and deception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Perceived coercion refers to the subjective experience or appreciation (generally by the patient himself) of what is/what is not coercion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Examples of perceived coercion include feelings of injustice and unfairness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Recent research shows the harmful effects of coercive measures on people with mental health problems. Although coercive measures are sometimes described as providing a sense of control and safety for patients, many of them also describe feelings associated with fear, trauma, and disempowerment when experiencing these measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In effect, the literature consulted prior to this review would suggest that involuntary hospitalization is associated with a higher risk of suicide during hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and that perceived coercion in a psychiatric setting also increases the risk of post-discharge suicide attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">It is also suggested that it is rather common factors, such as the intensity of services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the quality of the therapeutic relationship between the person and health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], that would influence the recovery of the person under coercive measures. In such a context, managerial approaches to risk management (which often justify the imposition of coercive measures) should be complemented and calibrated by an emphasis on relational approaches to care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Nurses, like many health professionals, have an important responsibility to protect, recognize, and defend the rights of people with mental health issues, including human rights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the evidence suggests that many health professionals sometimes exceed the limits imposed by law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], may underestimate informal coercion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and should be educated about its use and potential adverse effects given its estimated prevalence in psychiatric settings between 29 and 59% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Knowledge of the laws governing the use of these exceptional measures in psychiatry, that have a direct impact on the recognition of the rights of persons under coercion, is considered inconsistent between different types of health professionals and generally highly insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Little is known about how human rights are understood, integrated into practice, and participate in the experience of the health professionals responsible for implementing these measures. In nursing, several literature reviews focus on decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], ethical challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], or the quality of care provided under coercion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, to date, no systematic literature review has qualitatively synthesized the clinical relevance of human rights in psychiatric and mental health nursing practice.

A recent systematic review aimed to identify the ethical challenges that arise when coercion is used in mental health care but considered human rights as an exclusion criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The aim of this review is to produce a qualitative synthesis of how human rights are actually integrated into nursing practice in the context of coercive work.

The second objective of this review is to produce an explanatory framework of how human rights are recognized, protected, or challenged in psychiatric and mental health nursing. The main research question is as follows: What are the perspectives of nurses working in adult psychiatry regarding the patient&#x02019;s rights when coercion is used?

After the data extraction, the meta-ethnographic approach of Noblit and Hare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] will be used to synthesize the data. The reviewers will then refer to the eMERGe reporting guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] to report on the analytic synthesis process followed to produce the meta-ethnography and qualitative findings. This research protocol integrates the phases 1 (selecting meta-ethnography and getting started), 2 (deciding what is relevant), and 3 (reading included studies) of the meta-ethnography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] since they are specifically related to the systematic literature review.

Noblit and Hare propose a seven-step approach for qualitative evidence synthesis: (1) selecting meta-ethnography and getting started, (2) deciding what is relevant, (3) reading included studies, (4) determining how studies are related, (5) translating studies into one another, (6) synthesizing translations, and (7) expressing the synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This strategy allows for the development of interpretive explanations related to the extracted data and for a synthesis of these interpretive explanations in an explanatory framework. Noblit and Hare&#x02019;s methodological approach is frequently used in health sciences to provide a qualitative synthesis of patients&#x02019; or health professionals&#x02019; experiences of a given phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Since the objectives of this systematic review is to synthesize and provide an explanatory framework of how human rights are integrated in the practice of psychiatric and mental health nurses in the context of coercive work, the meta-ethnographic approach appeared as the most appropriate methodology for this study. Although this approach is generally appropriate for a small number of qualitative studies, the authors of this protocol and literature review will draw on Toye et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] guidance if needed to ensure that the synthesis of a larger number of studies &#x0201c;remain(s) firmly grounded in the [selected] primary qualitative studies&#x0201d; (p. 3).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Search strategy</title><p id="Par14">The research strategy was developed in an inductive manner during the preliminary research phase. The greatest challenge in this step was to formulate a strategy to identify contemporary empirical and qualitative articles discussing psychiatric and mental health nurses&#x02019; perspective on human rights when coercive measures are used. During this stage, different search strategies were tested in order to decide what was relevant for the meta-ethnography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It was determined that the phenomenon of interest in this review was coercion, from which various human rights issues may arise.</p><p id="Par15">The PICo method for qualitative research (Population [nurses], phenomenon of Interest [coercion], Context [psychiatry and mental health]) was then used to formulate the research strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Various articles addressing the phenomenon of coercion in a psychiatric context were first identified by manual research. This search facilitated the identification of key concepts in the final research strategy. For example, it was possible to apply the concept of coercion in different ways by identifying keywords and descriptors of situations typical to the psychiatric context (e.g., seclusion, restraints, involuntary hospitalization, and treatment). Similarly, terms such as involuntary hospitalization varied among authors and jurisdictions. During this stage, it was also possible to clarify what was meant by nurses&#x02019; &#x0201c;perspectives&#x0201d; (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A university librarian was also consulted to support the development of the search strategy.

If possible, data related to the settings in which the coercion takes place (for example, hospital care, community care), as well as the type of coercion used (for example, use of restraint, seclusion, or involuntary treatment) will also be extracted. Since the analysis process is iterative, inductive, and based on qualitative data, it is possible that new clusters of data emerge during data extraction and synthesis. Following the approach suggested by Noblit and Hare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], qualitative data from the selected studies&#x02019; results will also be extracted. More specifically, first- and second-order constructs will be extracted and analyzed to produce an interpretive synthesis of the data. Thus, the extraction of this type of data will focus on identifying the themes, metaphors, or central concepts of each study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data synthesis</title><p id="Par23">The meta-ethnographic approach used will require a thorough reading and re-reading of the selected studies in order to identify key concepts. All of these studies will be inserted into NVivo software which will facilitate the extraction of general descriptive and qualitative data, as well as the process of immersion within the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Thus, the coding of data and the identification of key concepts of the selected studies will be carried out through this software. If necessary, these data will also be aggregated in the form of an excel table to facilitate the synthesis and description of the results of the literature review. Data synthesis will be collaborative and carried out by the two main reviewers (PPL and SVO). The data synthesis will also be reviewed by MHG and JDJ until consensus is reached among the four reviewers.</p><p id="Par24">The synthesis of the qualitative data extracted in the previous step will consist in identifying the key concepts of the selected studies and determining how the different studies are associated with each other, to the research question and the phenomenon of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These concepts must above all remain faithful to the description of human rights during coercive work as it is experienced by psychiatric and mental health nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This synthesis, which consists of &#x0201c;translating studies into one another&#x0201d; (p. 9), will integrate reciprocal (converging) and refutational (diverging) data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The collaborative process in which the reviewers will engage will allow a consensus to be reached on the interpretation of first- and second-order constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The general descriptive data and qualitative data from each study will be compared with each other so that the approach remains sensitive to the context of the data collected. Subsequently, these concepts will be synthesized to produce an explanatory framework of how human rights are integrated into the practice of psychiatric and mental health nurses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par26">Current research hypothesizes that it is primarily the intensity of services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the quality of the therapeutic relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], rather than coercion, that have a positive effect on the person&#x02019;s recovery. Anecdotal evidence suggests the positive impact of human rights-based approaches to the recovery of people with mental health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In order to further explore the potential impact of these approaches, it seems necessary to map the current state of practices of health professionals who share responsibility for implementing coercive measures. This qualitative research review will provide a better understanding of how human rights issues influence or are considered in the daily practice of nurses when using coercion in psychiatry.</p><p id="Par27">Over the past decade, several systematic reviews have documented the perspective of psychiatric and mental health nurses in terms of the decision-making process they engage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the ethical dilemmas they face [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the quality of care they provide in a coercive context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, few studies focusing on the provision of nursing care in a coercive context have adopted a human rights perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This is surprising, since coercive measures are considered by many as a significant violation of human rights and should therefore be used as a last resort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A recent study by the first and third author [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] suggests many difficulties in applying coercive measures like involuntary treatment in the psychiatric setting, such as the involvement of family caregivers and the maintenance of the therapeutic alliance between service users and health professionals. Involuntary treatment is also sometimes perceived as promoting better access to mental health while inducing a feeling of fear for the person concerned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A recent meta-ethnography also demonstrates that the main themes associated with the experience of people affected by seclusion in psychiatry are the feeling of being &#x0201c;admitted to prison&#x0201d; and deprived of their rights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. These findings are troubling for the recognition, protection, and promotion of human rights in the psychiatric context and require further exploration.</p><p id="Par28">To our knowledge, this will be the first literature review combining a meta-ethnographic approach and a human rights perspective to examine the attitudes, experience, and practices of psychiatric and mental health nurses related to coercive work. By including a human right perspective, this systematic review will identify research areas that need further exploration and contribute to the development of a research agenda related to coercion and human rights in psychiatric and mental health work. The quality assessment of the articles prior to their final inclusion will also provide an opportunity to discuss the challenges associated with this step when meta-ethnography is used as a methodological approach. It will also be possible to discuss the global methodological issues associated with qualitative research on this topic. The meta-ethnographic approach will be particularly useful in determining how human rights are conceptualized in the scientific literature reviewed. By distinguishing first-order and second-order constructs, it will promote a better understanding of the use and integration of these rights in nurses&#x02019; daily practice. The extraction and analysis of first-order and second-order constructs will provide a critical review of the scientific literature to identify how the work of nurses, who share the responsibility for implementing these coercive measures, is framed as a human rights issue. The results of this review will then provide qualitative evidence to better understand how nurses can contribute to the recognition, protection, and advocate for human rights in a psychiatric context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p id="Par29">Several limitations to this systematic literature review and meta-ethnography must be addressed. Since the data from this protocol target coercion, it is possible that the importance of different approaches to coercion prevention (e.g., de-escalation techniques) or postvention may be minimized. As this study focuses on the nurses&#x02019; perspectives, it is also possible that interdisciplinary or non-nursing specific studies may be excluded. This study is also limited by the contextual nature of human rights, the recognition of which differs from one jurisdiction to another. This study also presents different strengths. To our knowledge, although the principles of advocacy and social justice are central to nursing practice, no study has yet synthesized qualitative evidence on human rights issues in psychiatric and mental health nursing. In a context where it is suggested that relational approaches to care can at least partially address the issues raised by coercion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and that rights-based approaches can facilitate the recovery process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], this study is also an opportunity to better understand how these approaches can be integrated into current nursing practices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>
