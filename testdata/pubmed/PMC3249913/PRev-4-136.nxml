The formation of peptic ulcers depends on the presence of acid and peptic activity in gastric juice plus a breakdown in mucosal defenses. There are two major factors that can disrupt the mucosal resistance to injury: non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) example, aspirin and Helicobacter pylori infection. Numerous natural products have been evaluated as therapeutics for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including peptic ulcer. There has been considerable pharmacological investigation into the antiulcer activity of some compounds. In this work, we shall review the literature on different medicinal plant and alkaloids with antiulcer activity. This article reviews the antiacid/anti-peptic, gastroprotective and/or antiulcer properties of the most commonly employed herbal medicines and their identified active constituents. The experimental parameters used for antiulcer activity were cold restraint stress-induced ulcer model, Diclofenac-induced ulcer model in rats, (HCl&#x02013;ethanol)-induced ulcer in mice and water immersion stress-induced ulcer in rats. The ideal aims of treatment of peptic ulcer disease are to relieve pain, heal the ulcer and delay ulcer recurrence. About 70% of patients with peptic ulcer disease are infected by Helicobacter pylori and eradication of this microorganism seems to be curative for this disease. This article reviews drugs derived from medicinal plant more commonly used in the world for peptic ulcer and, if reported, the antiulcer activity. This article will be concerned only with the antiulcer and gastro-protective effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Alkaloids</kwd><kwd>antiulcer activity</kwd><kwd>flavonoids</kwd><kwd>peptic ulcer</kwd><kwd>saponin</kwd><kwd>tannins</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>An ulcer is basically an inflamed break in the skin or the mucus membrane lining the alimentary tract. Ulceration occurs when there is a disturbance of the normal equilibrium caused by either enhanced aggression or diminished mucosal resistance. About 19 out of 20 peptic ulcers are duodenal. Gastric ulcers, found in the stomach wall, are less common. The gastric mucosa is continuously exposed to potentially injurious agents such as acid, pepsin, bile acids, food ingredients, bacterial products (Helicobacter pylori) and drugs. These agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of gastric ulcer, including enhanced gastric acid and pepsin secretion, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and cell proliferation growth, diminished gastric blood flow and gastric motility.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>

</p><p>A large number of spices and herbs have been evaluated by various researchers for their antiulcer effects to achieve a favorable outcome. Large numbers of medicinal plants and dietary nutrients have been shown to possess gastro-protective activities such as Aloe, Terminalia Chebula, Vetiveria Ziziinoides, Ginseng, Capsicum etc.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>The potential medicinal plants used in ulcer</title><p>In spite of being one of the well-known medicinal plants used inIndian traditional medicine to treat several ailments, studies pertaining to the pharmacologicalproperties of some medicinal plants are very scarce. We studied the antiulcer activity and acute toxicity of some medicinal plants. Our investigation showed that these investigated medicinal plants could prevent ulcer in rats in a dose-dependent manner. Histological studies revealed that these medicinal plants did not show any acute toxicity. Preliminary photochemical screening of this medicinal plant identified the presence of important secondary metabolites like flavonoids and tannins.</p><p>A variety of botanical products have been reported to possess antiulcer activity but the documented literature has centered primarily on pharmacological action in experimental animals. Except for a few phytogenic compounds (i.e. aloe, liquorice and chilly), limited clinical data are available to support the use of herbs as gastro-protective agents and thus, the data on efficacy and safety are limited. Despite this, there are several botanical products with potential therapeutic applications because of their high efficacy and low toxicity. Finally, it should be noted that substances such as flavonoids, aescin, aloe gel and many others, that possess antiulcer activity are of particular therapeutic importance as most of the antiinflammatory drugs used in modern medicine are ulcerogenic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Active principles of antiulcer activity are Flavonoids, terpenoids and tannins.</p><p>Some medicinal plants used in the treatment of ulcer:</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Ficus arnottiana</title><p>Family: Moraceae</p><p>Part used: Fruits, leafs</p><p>Common name:paras papal.</p><p>Active constituent: Fruits of the plant contain &#x003b2;-sitosterol, Gluanol acetate and Glucose, Friedelin, Sterols, alkaloids, Carbohydrates, Tannins, Phenols.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Chemical structure [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Scheme 1</xref>]</title><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Some potential plants with antiulcer activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PRev-4-136-g001"/></table-wrap><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Scheme 1</label><graphic xlink:href="PRev-4-136-g002"/></fig><p>Description: It is an important traditional medicinal plant distributed throughout India, mostly in rocky hills of 1350 m elevations.

These trees can grow very large, such as Alstonia pneumatophore, recorded with a height of 60 m and a diameter of more than 2 m. Alstonia longifolia is the only species growing in Central America. The leathery, sessile, simple leaves are elliptical, ovate, linear or lanceolate and wedge-shaped at the base. The leaf blade is dorsoventral, medium-sized to large and disposed oppositely or in a whorl and with entire margin. The leaf venation is pinnate, with numerous veins ending in a marginal vein. Alstonia trees are used in traditional medicine. The bark of the <italic>Alstonia constricta</italic> and the <italic>Alstonia scholaris</italic> is a source of a remedy against malaria, toothache, rheumatism and snake bites. The latex is used in treating coughs, throat sores and fever. Many Alstonia species are commercial timbers, called pule or pulai in Indonesia and Malaysia.</p><p><bold>Active constituent:</bold> Alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, phlobatannin, reducing sugars, simple phenolic, steroids, saponins and tannins.

The above different chemical compounds detected in <italic>A. scholaris</italic>, could make the plant useful in treating different ailments and have the potential for providing useful drug for human use. This is because the pharmacological activity of any plant is usually traced to particular compound. The presence of tannins and other phenolic compounds, which have antiseptic properties, could explain the use of this plant for the treatment of various diseases. It has also been mentioned that the antioxidant activity of plants might be due to their phenolic compounds.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Flavonoids are a group of polyphenolic compounds with known properties that include free-radical scavenging, inhibition of hydrolytic enzymes and anti-inflammatory actionThe saponin and flavonoids are used in ulcer treatments.</p><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Chemical structure [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Scheme 2</xref>]</title><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Scheme 2</label><graphic xlink:href="PRev-4-136-g003"/></fig><p><bold>Use:</bold> Used in ulcers, dysentery and wood paste is applied in rheumatism and toothache.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title><italic>Asparagus racemosus</italic> Willd</title><p>Local name: Satawari, satavari.</p><p>Family: Asparagaceae</p><p>Classification:</p><p>Kingdom: plantae</p><p>Phylum: Magnoliophyta</p><p>Class: liliopsida</p><p>Order: Asparagales</p><p>Family: Asparagaceae</p><p>Subfamily: Rhodendroideae</p><p>Tribe: rhododendreae</p><p>Genus: Asparagus</p><p>Specific epithet: Racemosus Willd.</p><p>Habitat: The plant grows best in tropical and subtropical dry and deciduous forests.</p><p>Part used: Shoots and tuberous roots.</p><p><bold><italic>Principal constituents:</italic></bold> The principal chemical constituents exhibiting medicinal properties are Shatavarin (steroidal saponin).

The milky white sap produced by the trunk of the papaya tree is also a useful remedy and is applied externally to accelerate the curing of abrasions, ulcers, boils, warts and cancerous growth. The papaya seeds are also useful as when ingested they help in throwing out worms from the body. The latex or the white sap produced by the papaya tree trunk is also effectual in this manner, but comparatively more aggressive. On the other hand, an infusion prepared with the flowers of the plant may be used to stimulate menstruation. The decoction prepared by boiling the ripe fruit in water is useful for curing enduring diarrhea and dysentery among children. While the raw papaya contains a white milky substance called papain, the ripe fruit is moderately laxative and helps in the movement of bowels.

Various herbal plants and plants extracts have significant antiulcer activity in animal models. It has muco-protective activity and gastric anti-secretary when compared with that of reference drugs. The extract is non-toxic even at relatively high concentrations. The antiulcer activity is probably due to the presence of flavonoids in all this plants. Our results showed that above-mentioned medicinal plants could prevent ulcer in rats in a dose-dependent manner. A variety of botanical products have been reported to possess antiulcer activity; finally, it should be noted that substances such as flavonoids, and tannins that possess antiulcer activity are of particular therapeutic importance. The results of this study indicate that extracts of leaves and plants extracts of some medicinal plant have good potentials for use in peptic ulcer disease. Our results showed that these medicinal plants could prevent ulcer in rats in a dose-dependent manner. The present study was designed to explore the mechanism of action of medicinal plants against experimentally induced gastric ulcers. The bark extracts were tested against aspirin- and ethanol-induced gastric ulcer models and histamine infusion-induced gastric acid secretion model in rats. It is concluded from this study that the drug possesses antiulcer activity in different gastric ulcer models. The antiulcer activity of the drug can be attributed to free-radical scavenging property, inhibition of acid secretory parameters and strengthening of gastric mucosal barrier.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
