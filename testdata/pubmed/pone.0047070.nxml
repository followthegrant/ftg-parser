At an inflammatory site, phagocytes serve as central regulators for both pro-inflammatory and homeostatic anti-inflammatory processes. However, it remains unclear if this is a recent evolutionary development or whether the capacity to balance between these two seemingly contradictory processes is a feature already displayed in lower vertebrates. In this study, we used murine (C57BL/6) and teleost fish (<italic>C. auratus</italic>) <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models to assess the evolutionary conservation of this dichotomy at a site of inflammation. At the level of the macrophage, we found that teleost fish already displayed divergent pro-inflammatory and homeostatic responses following internalization of zymosan or apoptotic bodies, respectively, and that these were consistent with those of mice. However, fish and mice displayed significant differences <italic>in vivo</italic> with regards to the level of responsiveness to zymosan and apoptotic bodies, the identity of infiltrating leukocytes, their rate of infiltration, and the kinetics and strength of resulting antimicrobial responses. Unlike macrophages, significant differences were identified between teleost and murine neutrophilic responses. We report for the first time that activated murine, but not teleost neutrophils, possess the capacity to internalize apoptotic bodies. This internalization translates into reduction of neutrophil ROS production. This may play an important part in the recently identified anti-inflammatory activity that mammalian neutrophils display during the resolution phase of inflammation. Our observations are consistent with continued honing of inflammatory control mechanisms from fish to mammals, and provide added insights into the evolutionary path that has resulted in the integrated, multilayered responses that are characteristic of higher vertebrates.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC) grants to DRB and MB.

Further, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have shown that the clearance of apoptotic cells within an inflammatory site also promotes the production of anti-inflammatory immune mediators, notably interleukin (IL)-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;, and platelet activating factor, as well as a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, IL-6 IL-8, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23, prostaglandin E2, leukotriene C4 and thromboxane B2 <xref rid="pone.0047070-Fadok1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047070-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Among others, the shift in the balance between TNF-&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2; contributes to the &#x02018;quenching&#x02019; of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species <xref rid="pone.0047070-Serinkan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

Importantly, although continued ROS production can lead to unnecessary tissue damage, premature neutrophilic apoptosis, and inhibition of apoptotic cell uptake, NADPH oxidase also appears to play an important role for the effective resolution of inflammation, by contributing to macrophage recognition and clearance of activated neutrophils at sites of inflammation <xref rid="pone.0047070-Fadeel1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Phagocytes contribute to both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory (resolution) responses at infectious foci <xref rid="pone.0047070-Maderna1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047070-Bianchi1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047070-Fullard1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, it remains unclear if this dichotomy is a recent evolutionary development or whether the capacity to balance between these two seemingly contradictory processes following phagocytosis is a feature already displayed by lower vertebrate phagocytes. Recent evolutionary developments may have provided novel strategies for the control of inflammation, but may contribute to the development of inflammation-associated diseases as new mechanisms look to integrate into existing immune regulatory networks. Importantly, phagocytes are known to internalize pathogens, apoptotic bodies or both at sites of inflammation, raising questions about the contributions of individual phagocytes to the inflammatory process <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In this study, we examined the effects of homeostatic phagocytosis on the regulation of pro-inflammatory antimicrobial responses. Using a comparative model of zymosan-induced peritonitis, the impact of apoptotic bodies on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured <italic>in vivo</italic> in both mice and fish. Zymosan is a commonly used pathogen mimic that induces self-resolving peritonitis <italic>in vivo</italic>

Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have shown that zymosan phagocytosis results in activation of pro-inflammatory responses that include induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates and increased infiltration of leukocytes, predominantly neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0047070-Cash1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0047070-Cuzzocrea1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Our findings suggest that the divergent responses to pathogenic vs. homeostatic particles at the level of the macrophage are already well established in lower vertebrates. However, notable differences were found between lower and higher vertebrates in the cellular components, kinetics, and magnitude of the inflammatory response. Our results provide added examples for the increased compartmentalization of cellular responses across leukocyte subsets in higher vertebrates. Most notably, our results suggest that the newly identified neutrophilic contributions to the down-regulation of acute inflammatory processes may represent a recent evolutionary development. This continued honing of phagocytic responses is likely a testament to the ever-increasing role of the phagocyte in the promotion and regulation of inflammation across evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animals were maintained according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care, and protocols were approved by the University of Alberta Animal Care and Use Committee Committee (ACUC-Biosciences; protocol numbers 760 and 595807).

For the group that had only internalized apoptotic bodies, pre-incubation did not lead to an added decrease in ROS production, suggesting that maximal down-regulation of respiratory burst responses was achieved by 2 h. Together, these data show that internalization of apoptotic bodies leads to discrete cellular events that result in reduced macrophage activation in the presence or absence of stimulatory zymosan particles. The former indicates that this control mechanism(s) is sufficient to over-ride stimulatory signals that would otherwise lead to pro-inflammatory responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Zymosan differentially induces cellular infiltration in mice and teleost fish</title><p>Cellular infiltration and induction of antimicrobial defenses are two of the hallmarks of inflammation at an infection site <xref rid="pone.0047070-Soehnlein1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

Fish mounted very robust, quick responses to zymosan that led to the recruitment of several leukocyte populations. Addition of apoptotic bodies resulted in a marked suppression of these responses.

Goldfish exhibited significantly higher cellular infiltration than mice following intraperitoneal challenge with zymosan (20-fold increase vs 1.5 fold increase). In goldfish, this infiltrate was composed of both lymphoid and myeloid cells, while murine leukocyte infiltration was dominated by neutrophils. Furthermore, apoptotic bodies inhibited infiltration of both myeloid and lymphoid cells in goldfish. This is in sharp contrast to mice, where the infiltrating macrophage and lymphocyte populations modestly decreased while neutrophil infiltration was maintained in the presence of apoptotic body stimuli.</p><p>Murine respiratory burst responses also displayed added cell specificity compared to our teleost model. In mice, apoptotic bodies preferentially caused a decrease in neutrophil respiratory burst, whereas only a limited effect was evident in macrophage responses. Murine respiratory burst responses also displayed faster kinetics preceding the wave of leukocyte infiltration, suggesting a significant contribution from resident peritoneal leukocytes. Our results are consistent with an evolutionary shift towards leukocyte specialization in mammals. This shift appears to favor targeted induction of leukocyte infiltration (F4/80<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/Gr1<sup>+</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup> neutrophils in this model), and is increasingly reliant on local peritoneal leukocyte populations for early activation of innate antimicrobial effector mechanisms.

However, recent studies highlight another role for mammalian neutrophils as contributors to homeostatic responses at an inflammatory site. Within hours after entering an inflammatory site, infiltrating neutrophils actively produce protective molecules, such as lipoxins from arachidonic acid, which promote resolution of an inflammatory response (coined &#x02018;lipid mediator class- switching&#x02019;) <xref rid="pone.0047070-Levy1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Our results add to this paradigm and indicate that mammalian neutrophils display an increased capacity to participate in the down-regulation of inflammation though contact dependent interactions with apoptotic bodies. This contact and subsequent internalization of apoptotic bodies significantly reduces neutrophilic as well as macrophage ROS production through a putative soluble factor-mediated mechanism. The identity of this soluble factor(s) is currently unknown but lipoxins have been shown to attenuate ROS production in a number of cells including microglia <xref rid="pone.0047070-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0047070-NascimentoSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, and aggregated peripheral blood leukocytes <xref rid="pone.0047070-Borgeson1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Further, while the ability of neutrophils to internalize apoptotic bodies appears to have evolved recently, teleost neutrophils are able to produce soluble factor(s) that downregulate macrophage ROS production. As such, future studies should assess the potential differences between mammals and teleosts in the production of pro-resolution molecules such as lipoxins, resolvins, and protectins, as well as the role(s) that these molecules may have in the resolution of inflammation through neutrophil/apoptotic body contact-dependent and independent mechanisms.</p><p>The balance between pathogen and homeostatic phagocytic responses is critical for the effective induction of pathogen clearance mechanisms that are efficiently controlled to prevent excessive tissue damage <xref rid="pone.0047070-Medzhitov1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Loss of this balance contributes to the development and exacerbation of autoimmune diseases that include systemic lupus erythematosus <xref rid="pone.0047070-Munoz1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, adult respiratory distress syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis <xref rid="pone.0047070-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, and can also lead to incomplete pathogen clearance <xref rid="pone.0047070-Soehnlein1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The specific importance of homeostatic phagocytic responses is further highlighted by several recent studies. For example, injection of apoptotic bodies has been shown to prevent the development of experimental immune complex-mediated inflammatory arthritis <xref rid="pone.0047070-vanLent1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, accelerate the resolution of acute inflammation <xref rid="pone.0047070-Huynh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, expand a pool of TGF-&#x003b2; tolerogenic T cells <xref rid="pone.0047070-Kleinclauss1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, non-specifically facilitate allogenic bone marrow engraftment <xref rid="pone.0047070-Bittencourt1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, and interfere with graft rejection and the development of graft-versus-host disease <xref rid="pone.0047070-Saas1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. These effects appear to be linked to the capacity of exogenously administered apoptotic bodies to promote an immunosuppressive environment, activate immunomodulatory cells, and decrease inflammatory immune cell infiltration <xref rid="pone.0047070-Huynh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. We have shown here for the first time that the presence of apoptotic bodies results in greatly diminished zymosan-induced ROS production. This provides added insights into the mechanisms by which apoptotic bodies contribute to the control of inflammatory processes and may also highlight unique therapeutic opportunities for treatment of those disease states that possess a strong ROS component.</p><p>Together, our results demonstrate that the distinct polarization of immune cells in response to inflammatory or homeostatic stimuli are evolutionarily intact in bony fish. However, differences in the rate of leukocyte migration to the inflammatory site, increased selectivity for the leukocyte subsets recruitment to this site, increased participation of resident leukocyte pools, and changes to the kinetics and strength of the antimicrobial response highlight the significant honing of that has developed for the control of inflammation across evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0047070.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>

<bold>Characterization of goldfish peritoneal myeloid cells.</bold> (A) Total peritoneal exudates were analyzed by imaging flow cytometry and four distinct cellular subsets characterized based on area, internal complexity, and morphology. Unlike macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, monocytes and neutrophils could not be subdivided into two distinct populations solely based on these parameters. Modified Wright's stain confirmed the presence of cells with classical lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte/macrophage morphology. (B) To better differentiate between myeloid populations within the goldfish peritoneal exudate, cells were analyzed based on surface CSF-1R expression and Sudan Black cytochemical staining, which denote monocyte/macrophages and neutrophils, respectively.
