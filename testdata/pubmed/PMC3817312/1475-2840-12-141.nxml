The mRNA and protein expression of profilin-1 was determined using real-time PCR and western blotting analyses. The levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as the activities of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) and protein kinase C (PKC), were detected using the appropriate kits. The levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) were determined using HPLC.

DPI (10 &#x003bc;mol/L) markedly decreased the elevated levels of ROS induced by AGEs (200 &#x003bc;g/ml, 24 h); however, GF 109203X (10 &#x003bc;mol/L) and BAY-117082 (5 &#x003bc;mol/L) exhibited no significant effect on the formation of ROS by AGEs. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that AGEs markedly increased the expression of profilin-1 in the cytoplasm and the formation of actin stress fibres, resulting in the rearrangement and redistribution of the cytoskeleton. This effect was significantly ameliorated by DPI, GF 109203X, BAY-117082 or siRNA treatment of profilin-1. Incubation with DPI and GF 109203X markedly inhibited the activation of PKC triggered by AGEs, and DPI and BAY-117082 significantly decreased the activity of NF-&#x003ba;B mediated by AGEs. Disruption of profilin-1 gene expression attenuated the extent of endothelial abnormalities by reducing ICAM-1 and ADMA levels and elevating NO levels (P&#x0003c;0.05, P&#x0003c;0.01), but this disruption had no effect on the activities of NF-&#x003ba;B and PKC (P&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings suggested that profilin-1 might act as an ultimate and common cellular effector in the process of metabolic memory (endothelial abnormalities) mediated by AGEs via the ROS/PKC or ROS/NF-&#x0049b;B signalling pathways.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Advanced glycation end products (AGEs)</kwd><kwd>Profilin-1</kwd><kwd>Endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>Cytoskeletal rearrangement</kwd><kwd>Reactive oxygen species (ROS)</kwd><kwd>Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B)</kwd><kwd>Protein kinase C (PKC)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious and rapidly growing disease, and diabetes-related vascular complications are major causes of patient disability and death. Large-scale clinical studies have confirmed that early intensive blood glucose control can reduce the incidence of diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, for patients with chronic long-term hyperglycaemia, despite strict future long-term glycaemic control, diabetes-related vascular complications remain or can develop. This phenomenon is known as &#x0201c;metabolic memory&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;hyperglycaemia memory.&#x0201d; There is growing evidence that faster-generated advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the conditions of long-term high glucose may be a unifying explanation for this phenomenon
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that AGEs are involved in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in diabetic vascular complications, and its levels in diabetic patients are highly correlated with the severity of macrovascular and microvascular complications
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, the mechanism of &#x0201c;metabolic memory&#x0201d; mediated by AGEs has not been fully elucidated to date. The direct effects of AGEs include protein glycation and crosslinking, which affect normal protein physiological functions. In addition, this process is prolonged and irreversible. There is a growing body of evidence that AGEs mediate &#x0201c;metabolic memory&#x0201d;, primarily via indirect pathways via its receptors (receptor for advanced glycation end products, RAGE)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Indeed, binding of AGEs to RAGE produces the excess formation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) independent of actual glucose, which subsequently activates protein kinase C (PKC) and the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) via intracellular signalling cascade reactions. This activation subsequently initiates the expression of a variety of diabetes-related genes and RAGE
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, self-maintaining conditions linked to AGE formation demonstrate that AGEs can conceivably contribute to &#x0201c;metabolic memory.&#x0201d;</p><p>Profilin-1 as an actin-binding protein is a class of small molecule proteins (12 to 15 KD) and is widely distributed in various types of cells with highly conserved sequences. This plays an important role in the regulation of actin polymerisation in a number of motility functions. The reorganisation and redistribution of the cytoskeleton, particularly actin proteins, forms a pathological basis for endothelial cell contraction and increased vascular permeability, which contributes to endothelial abnormalities and vascular disease
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Under pathological conditions, such as diabetes or atherosclerosis (AS), profilin-1 levels were increased in atherosclerotic lesions, the aorta or in serum. It was recently reported that profilin-1 overexpression triggered indicators of endothelial dysfunction and attenuated the expression of profilin-1 conferred protection from AS in vivo
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, Romeo et al. reported that profilin-1 and low density lipoprotein (LDL) was downstream molecules mediating diabetic endothelial dysfunction, and revealed that the endothelial damage triggered by the profilin-1 pathway in diabetes and in lipid oxidation was surprisingly similar
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that profilin-1 may be a common and ultimate pathway in endothelial cell injuries, and blockade of profilin-1-mediated biological effects may help to prevent the occurrence of endothelial abnormalities and vascular disease.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that incubation of endothelial cells with AGEs caused a significant increase in endothelial permeability via cytoskeletal alterations and actin rearrangement
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Due to the pivotal role of profilin-1 in the reorganisation and redistribution of actin, we propose that profilin-1 may be involved in metabolic memory mediated by AGEs as an ultimate pathway in endothelial injury. Thus, the present study aimed to elucidate the role of profilin-1 in endothelial injury mediated by AGEs and its underlying signal transduction pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC12,ATCC,CRL-2480) were obtained from the Tumor Research Institute of Beijing Medical University (Beijing, China).

These results showed that antioxidants or blockade of the PKC or NF-&#x003ba;B pathways significantly improved the endothelial abnormalities induced by AGEs, concomitantly with down-regulation of profilin-1 expression (Figures&#x000a0;

This was attenuated by treatment with the antioxidant DPI, PKC inhibitor GF109203X or NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor BAY117082; (2) Knockdown of profilin-1 gene expression attenuated AGE-induced endothelial abnormalities; (3) AGEs up-regulated the expression of profilin-1 via the excess production of ROS and subsequent activation of PKC and NF-&#x003ba;B. Taken together, these findings suggested, for the first time, that profilin-1 plays an important role in endothelial injury induced by AGEs, which may contribute to macrovascular complications in DM.</p><p>There is accumulating evidence that AGEs formation due to chronic hyperglycaemia has a chemical, cellular and tissue effect in metabolic memory. AGEs have been previously associated with the development of diabetes-related macrovascular and microvascular complications
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It has been recently reported that dietary AGEs in diabetic patients or intraperitoneal injection of AGEs in rats caused an impairment in the vascular endothelium
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], which was prevented by treatment with the AGE inhibitor benfotiamine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Accumulation of AGEs in the vasculature initiated a series of morphological and functional changes in endothelial cells and induced an increase in endothelial permeability and cell apoptosis. Moreover, it also promoted endothelial (progenitor) cell migration, adhesion and focal contact formation, concomitantly with the decreased synthesis of NO and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It is well-known that the vascular endothelium is an important target of hyperglycaemic damage and an increase in endothelial permeability to macromolecules results in vascular dysfunction that is associated with several pathological states, including diabetes. Previous studies have demonstrated that the elevated ADMA levels connected with the uncoupling of NO synthesis contributing to endothelial dysfunction were associated with future cardiovascular events in diabetic patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Indeed, ADMA has been recognised as a marker of endothelial dysfunction and as a risk factor of cardiovascular diseases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It was recently reported that AGEs markedly increased ADMA levels in tubular and endothelial cells via the stimulation of local ROS production
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A great deal of studies have demonstrated that circulating level of sICAM-1 is considered to be one important marker of endothelial dysfunction and it was reported that the endothelial dysfunction marked by impaired acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortic rings and elevated levels of sICAM-1 were present in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the present study, we explored the effect of AGEs on the adverse actions in cultured endothelial cells. Consistent with previous studies, incubation with AGEs markedly reduced the synthesis of NO, increased the levels of ADMA, ICAM-1 and intracellular ROS, which was attenuated by pretreatment with the antioxidant DPI, suggesting that exogenous AGEs directly induced endothelial injury via the overproduction of ROS.</p><p>Profilin-1, an intracellular actin-binding protein, achieves its function via the regulation of the size, localization and dynamics of unpolymerised actin in cells contributing to endothelial cell contraction and vascular hyperpermeability. Previous studies have demonstrated that cardiovascular risk factors, such as homocysteine, LDL, ox-LDL, and oxidised cholesterol can up-regulated the expression of profilin-1 in cultured endothelial cells, resulting in cytoskeletal structural remodelling
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that overexpression of profilin-1 up-regulated the expression of ICAM-1, increased endothelial cell permeability, induced endothelial cell apoptosis and promoted endothelial cell migration, adhesion and focal contact formation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and silencing profilin-1 gene expression provided significant protection on endothelial cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In vivo studies have further demonstrated that profilin-1 expression was up-regulated in endothelial cells and macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE null mice, and in the aorta of diabetic rats, and the serum levels of profilin-1 were significantly elevated in patients with severe AS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In contrast, attenuated expression of profilin-1 conferred protection against AS in LDL receptor null mice
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recently, Romeo et al. reported that high-fat diet (HFD) up-regulated the expression of profilin-1 in both stromal vascular cells and adipocytes of white adipose tissue (WAT) and pfn heterozygote mice (PfnHet) displayed near normalization of HFD-induced glucose intolerance and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that profilin-1 plays an bran-new role in modulation of immune homeostasis within the WAT microenvironment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Because endothelial damage stimulated by profilin-1 in diabetes is surprisingly similar with that in lipid oxidation, it is conceivable that profilin-1 may function in a common pathway that induces vascular endothelial injuries in vascular lesions. It has been previously reported that incubation with AGEs caused a significant increase in the permeability of endothelial cell monolayers via significant disorganisation of the F-actin cytoskeleton and disruption of tight and adherent junctions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, detailed studies on the role of profilin-1 in AGE-induced adverse actions in vascular endothelial cells are lacking. In addition, the protection offered by specifically blocking the expression of profilin-1 against AGE-induced endothelial alterations has not yet been reported. This study found that treatment with AGEs markedly up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of profilin-1, which was accompanied by the rearrangement and redistribution of the cytoskeleton. However, silencing profilin-1 expression significantly attenuated endothelial injury by increasing the synthesis of NO and decreasing the levels of ADMA and ICAM-1. This occurred concomitantly with the attenuation of the cytoskeletal rearrangement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that AGEs up-regulated the expression of profilin-1 in vascular endothelial cells and the silencing of profilin-1 expression induced endothelial protection against AGEs effects.</p><p>It is well known that AGEs mediate metabolic memory via its receptor RAGE to produce excess ROS, and subsequently activates PKC and NF-&#x003ba;B signalling via intracellular signalling cascades. This process induces the expression of a variety of diabetes-related genes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Normalisation of the levels of mitochondrial ROS prevented glucose-induced activation of PKC and NF-&#x003ba;B, the formation of AGEs and sorbitol accumulation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It has been previously reported that AGEs induced PKC-&#x003b2; translocation, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 and NF-&#x003ba;B activation in bovine retinal endothelial cell, and pharmacological inhibition of these signalling pathways and antioxidants abolished the effects mediated by AGEs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Substantial evidence indicates that activation of PKC and NF-&#x003ba;B is a key biochemical event implicated in the development of diabetic vascular complications
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. To elucidate the potential signal pathway involved in endothelial injury induced by AGEs, antioxidant DPI, PKC inhibitor (GF 109203X) and NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor (BAY-117082) were employed. These results showed that pretreatment with DPI, GF 109203X and BAY-117082 attenuated endothelial injury, down-regulated the elevated expression of profilin-1 and ameliorated the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and redistribution induced by AGEs. Antioxidant DPI markedly inhibited the formation of ROS and activation of PKC and NF-&#x003ba;B signalling by AGEs. However, blockade of the PKC and NF-&#x003ba;B pathways had no significant effect on the overproduction of ROS. It was previously reported that shear stress increased the production of ROS and the activity of PKC in aortic endothelial cells, and the increase in ROS production was unaffected by GF109203X, whereas the activation of PKC was reduced by antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus we concluded that oxidative stress triggered by AGEs subsequently activated downstream NF-&#x003ba;B and PKC signalling pathways. Interestingly, silencing of profilin-1 gene expression induced endothelial protection, but did not affect the activity of NF-&#x003ba;B and PKC. Thus, it can be inferred that AGEs up-regulated the expression of profilin-1 and caused damage in endothelial cells via the production of excess ROS, thereby activating NF-&#x003ba;B and PKC signalling pathways. Thus, we speculated that profilin-1 functions as an ultimate and common cellular channel in endothelial abnormalities mediated by AGEs.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study suggests, for the first time, that profilin-1 is a downstream molecule that mediates endothelial injury induced by AGEs via the ROS/PKC or ROS/NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathways, and blockade of profilin-1-mediated biological effects may help to prevent endothelial injuries and vascular lesions in diabetes. Taken together, these findings set the stage for a prominent role of profilin-1 as a modulator of the actin cytoskeleton, which may underlie the pathology of vascular diseases, including diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADMA: Asymmetric dimethylarginine; AGE: Advanced glycation end products; AGE-BSA: AGE-bovine serum albumin; AS: Atherosclerosis; DAPI: 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DCFH-DA: 2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorofluorescin diacetate; DM: Diabetes mellitus; DMEM: Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified eagle&#x02019;s medium; DPI: Diphenyliodonium; FBS: Foetal bovine serum; GFP: Green fluorescent protein; HFD: High-fat diet; HPLC: High-performance liquid chromatography; HUVEC: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells; ICAM-1: Intercellular adhesion molecule-1; LDL: Low density lipoprotein; NAC: N-acetyl-L-cysteine; NF-&#x003ba;B: Nuclear factor kappa B; NO: Nitric oxide; PBS: Phosphate-buffered saline; PfnHet: Pfn heterozygote mice; PKC: Protein kinase C; PVDF: Polyvinylidene difluoride; RAGE: Receptor for advanced glycation end products; ROS: Reactive oxidative species; SOD: Superoxide dismutase; WAT: White adipose tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MC conceived the study, arranged the collaboration, initiated the manuscript, edited and compiled the final version for submission.
