A mutation in the <italic>gudB</italic> gene, coding for glutamate dehydrogenase, which generates 2-oxoglutarate from glutamate, significantly reduced growth in CDM, suggesting that glutamate and those amino acids generating glutamate, particularly proline, serve as the major carbon source in this medium. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies confirmed this supposition. Furthermore, a mutation in the <italic>ackA</italic> gene, coding for acetate kinase, also abrogated growth of JE2 in CDM, suggesting that ATP production from pyruvate-producing amino acids is also critical for growth. In addition, although a functional respiratory chain was absolutely required for growth, the oxygen consumption rate and intracellular ATP concentration were significantly lower during growth in CDM than during growth in glucose-containing media. Finally, transcriptional analyses demonstrated that expression levels of genes coding for the enzymes that synthesize glutamate from proline, arginine, and histidine are repressed by CcpA and carbon catabolite repression. These data show that pathways important for glutamate catabolism or ATP generation via Pta/AckA are important for growth in niches where glucose is not abundant, such as abscesses within skin and soft tissue infections.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>IMPORTANCE</title><p><italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> is a significant cause of both morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Significant advances have been made in the study of bacterial virulence factors and their functions in human disease and infection of these various organ systems. However, we have only begun to study how particular carbon and nitrogen sources that are available to <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> in specific host niches affect virulence factor expression and subsequent invasion, metastasis, or quiescence. As these metabolic pathways are required for bacterial proliferation within the host, knowledge of these pathways may reveal novel avenues for drug development.</p><p>A critical component of the innate immune response is the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) within activated phagocytes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Nitric oxide has wide-ranging effects on bacterial cells, including the disruption of lipid biosynthesis, central metabolism, respiration, and DNA replication (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Data from an evolving model demonstrate that, in contrast to other staphylococcal species, <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> has the ability to grow under NO stress conditions by fermenting glucose via lactate dehydrogenase, generating lactate, and facilitating NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration to maintain glycolytic flux and redox balance (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Under NO stress conditions, glycolysis is an essential process, as a mutation in the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (coded for by <italic>pyk</italic>) severely inhibits initiation of abscess formation in a skin and soft tissue murine model (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Indeed, inhibitors of pyruvate kinase have proved promising against <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> and other Gram-positive pathogens (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Following invasion of host tissue, <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> replicates in abscess communities that are encapsulated within fibrin deposits and infiltrating immune cells (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Much recent work has led to an overarching view of abscess formation, including the definition of essential virulence factors such as coagulase, von Willebrand factor, ClfA, FnbpA, and FnbpB (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). As the abscess matures within the fibrin wall, the center includes a large cluster of viable cells called the staphylococcal abscess community (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It is hypothesized that these niches have low concentrations of NO, allowing respiratory activity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>); however, it is predicted that <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> must grow on nonpreferred carbon sources, as glucose is not abundant (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Indeed, <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> lacks the ability to utilize phospholipids, triglycerides, and potentially other short-chain fatty acids as carbon sources due to the lack of both &#x003b2;-oxidation and glyoxylate shunt pathways. Therefore, other carbon sources that are available include lactate, excreted from <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> during fermentative growth, as well as peptides and free amino acids. Recent work from Spahich and colleagues showed that the addition of lactate plus peptides supports growth of <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> under conditions of low NO stress (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Growth under these conditions was dependent upon the presence of <underline>l</underline>actate <underline>q</underline>uinone <underline>o</underline>xidoreductase (Lqo; coded for by <italic>lqo</italic>), which assimilates lactate in an NAD-independent manner and requires an electron acceptor such as oxygen or nitrate (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Importantly, growth under these conditions also required peptides to serve as a carbon source to facilitate gluconeogenesis.</p><p>To date, little has been known about amino acid catabolism in <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic>; however, bioinformatics analysis suggests that pathways are present to catabolize multiple amino acids, including those that generate pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, and oxaloacetate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material). Although it is unclear in which microniches amino acid/peptide catabolism is important, it has been presumed that <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> utilizes peptides/amino acids as carbon sources as it encodes multiple oligopeptide permeases and free amino acid transporters (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition, <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> encodes metalloenzyme, serine, and papain-like cysteine proteases that have the ability to degrade host proteins (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We have recently understood that at least some of these amino acid catabolic pathways, such as those linking arginine and proline, are repressed by carbon catabolite repression (via CcpA) and are induced only when <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> is growing on nonpreferred carbon sources (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Thus, a <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus ccpA</italic> mutant interconverts arginine and proline via an intact urea cycle (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="tabS1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mBio.01434-16.6</object-id><label>TABLE&#x000a0;S1&#x000a0;</label><p>Predicted amino acid catabolism in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> FPR3757.

Therefore, to fully assess amino acid catabolism, a complete defined medium was prepared as described by Hussain and colleagues (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) except that no glucose was added. This medium contains 18&#x000a0;amino acids but excludes glutamine and asparagine. Aerobic growth of JE2 in CDM reached a maximum optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 3.0 following 8&#x000a0;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). Acetate was produced at a concentration of 2.3&#x000a0;mM by 6&#x000a0;h of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>), indicating catabolism of the glucogenic amino acids yielding pyruvate and the generation of acetate via Pta/AckA (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).

Amino acid analysis of the spent medium demonstrated that alanine, serine, glycine, threonine, arginine, proline, glutamate, and aspartate were rapidly consumed by 8&#x000a0;h of growth, whereas histidine was not consumed until 12&#x000a0;h of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). Consistent with these data was the generation of ammonia, which reached a maximum concentration of 4.3&#x000a0;mM at 6&#x000a0;h of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>) and is indicative of amino acid catabolism (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). There was a gradual consumption of other amino acids (cysteine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, and methionine) indicating probable use for protein synthesis but not for catabolic purposes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>Growth of <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> JE2 in CDM.

Complete catabolic pathways could not be identified for tryptophan, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and valine. Other than cysteine, which was not catabolized by JE2 in CDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>), the results of these analyses agreed with our experimental observations as detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>. To determine which catabolic pathways are required for growth in CDM, mutants from each predicted pathway (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>) (<italic>ald</italic> and <italic>ald2</italic>, alanine; <italic>sdaAA</italic>, serine, glycine, and threonine; <italic>aspA</italic>, aspartate; <italic>ansa</italic>, asparagine; <italic>rocF</italic>, arginine; <italic>putA</italic>, proline; <italic>gudB</italic>, glutamate; <italic>hutU</italic>, histidine) were chosen from a sequence-defined transposon library (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and growth analysis was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref> and S1A to I&#x000a0;in the supplemental material). These data demonstrated that only <italic>gudB</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1H</xref>), which encodes glutamate dehydrogenase and catalyzes the reaction between glutamate and 2-oxoglutarate, was required for growth in CDM. In addition, a transposon insertion within <italic>putA</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1G</xref>) resulted in a growth yield defect and mutations in <italic>ald</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref>) and <italic>aspA</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1D</xref>) resulted in growth lag defects, although their growth rates and yields were unaffected. Note that no phenotype was detected for <italic>ald2</italic>, which codes for a second proposed alanine dehydrogenase (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1B</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that amino acids which serve to fuel pyruvate (alanine) and oxaloacetate (aspartate) synthesis are important for initiation of growth in CDM. In addition, carbon derived from glutamate and those amino acids that can be converted to glutamate, particularly proline, serves as the major carbon source for fueling the TCA cycle and subsequent gluconeogenic reactions via phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase (coded for by <italic>pckA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). On the basis of these observations, we predicted that mutations in the TCA cycle enzymes generating oxaloacetate from 2-oxoglutarate would also be required for growth. Therefore, transposon mutants in <italic>sucA</italic> (encoding 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase), <italic>sucC</italic> (succinyl coenzyme A [CoA] synthetase), <italic>sdhA</italic> (succinate dehydrogenase), <italic>fumC</italic> (fumarase), and <italic>mqo1</italic> (malate dehydrogenase) were grown in CDM (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1J</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">N</xref>). As predicted, no growth was observed with the <italic>sucA</italic>, <italic>sucC</italic>, <italic>sdhA</italic>, and <italic>fumC</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1J</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">M</xref>). However, growth, albeit delayed, was observed with the <italic>mqo1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1N</xref>). This suggests that oxaloacetate can also be supplied by aspartate/glutamate transamination via AspA. Indeed, an <italic>mqo1</italic> mutant was unable to grow in CDM lacking aspartate (CDM-D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref>). However, since oxaloacetate supplied by aspartate cannot serve to complement the <italic>sucA</italic>, <italic>sucC</italic>, <italic>sdhA</italic>, or <italic>fumC</italic> mutants, these data suggest that these reactions may have critical functions other than carbon catabolism. Lastly, as predicted, no growth was observed for the <italic>pckA</italic> mutant, which is a critical enzyme required for gluconeogenesis via the generation of phosphoenolpyruvate from oxaloacetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1O</xref>).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="figS1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mBio.01434-16.1</object-id><label>FIG&#x000a0;S1&#x000a0;</label><p>Growth of JE2 and transposon mutants in CDM.

To address these hypotheses and to determine the fate of carbon following amino acid catabolism, <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glutamate, arginine, proline, aspartate, histidine, serine, threonine, alanine, and glycine were individually added to CDM and assayed via NMR metabolomics in mid- and post-exponential growth.</p></sec><sec id="s1.3"><title>Glutamate, proline, and arginine.</title><p>Metabolic intermediates originating from <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glutamate, proline, and arginine were very similar and included gluconeogenic intermediates (glucose-6P and phosphoglycerate) and intermediates that function in nucleotide biosynthesis (dihydroorotate, ribose, uracil, and adenosyl homocysteine) and glycolipid/lipoteichioic acid synthesis (glucose 1-phosphate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">S2A</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">C</xref>) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In addition, both aspartate and asparagine were detected from all three <sup>13</sup>C-labeled amino acids, suggesting that these amino acids were synthesized from oxaloacetate and the TCA cycle.

However, as previously reported, proline and arginine were not produced from glutamate (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Importantly, these results suggest that proline and arginine function as carbon sources as they both serve as precursors for glutamate, the key intermediate linking carbon and nitrogen metabolism.

Although genes for the <italic>arg</italic> pathway are present in <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic>, the growth conditions under which they are induced are not known. In a similar manner, work from others (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) demonstrated that arginine served as a precursor for proline biosynthesis in a <italic>ccpA</italic> mutant via RocF, RocD, and ProC.

Thus, when <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> is growing on nonpreferred carbon sources, an intact urea cycle is critical for the interconversion of arginine and proline. Since CDM does not contain a preferred carbon source, it is predicted that CcpA repression would be alleviated and that pathways to interconvert proline and arginine would be transcriptionally active. As predicted, proline synthesis was detected when <sup>13</sup>C-labeled arginine was added to CDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4B</xref>); however, arginine synthesis was not detected from <sup>13</sup>C-labeled proline. Instead, ornithine was detected from <sup>13</sup>C-labeled proline, suggesting that, in addition to its use in glutamate synthesis, carbon from proline also enters the urea cycle. To further investigate arginine synthesis in CDM, JE2 and JE2 <italic>ccpA</italic>::<italic>tet</italic> strains were grown in media lacking either proline (CDM-P) or arginine (CDM-R). It was found that the JE2 <italic>ccpA</italic>::<italic>tetL</italic> strain grew in both CDM-P and CDM-R, although growth was delayed in CDM-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1D</xref>).

However, unexpectedly, but consistent with the NMR data, JE2 could not grow in CDM-R, suggesting that proline cannot serve as a precursor for arginine synthesis in the absence of a <italic>ccpA</italic> mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s1.4"><title>Histidine and aspartate.</title><p>Carbon derived from <sup>13</sup>C histidine was primarily identified in glutamate metabolism and cysteine biosynthesis intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">S2D</xref>).

Similarly to other amino acids assayed, carbon derived from the glucogenic amino acids was identified in gluconeogenic intermediates, other amino acids, nucleotide biosynthesis, and glutamate. However, significantly more extracellular acetate was derived from alanine, threonine, and serine than from other amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5A</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that a bifurcation exists during amino acid catabolism in which pyruvate generated from the glucogenic amino acids is primarily utilized to generate acetate and ATP via AckA and little carbon enters the TCA cycle via citrate synthase until acetate is consumed from the medium at 6&#x000a0;h of growth. In addition, those amino acids that generate glutamate enter the TCA cycle at 2-oxoglutarate via GudB and serve as a carbon source to subsequently facilitate gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). Although it is clear from the NMR data that the <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucogenic amino acids synthesize glutamate, this hypothesis predicts that mutations within <italic>gltA</italic> (coding for citrate synthase), <italic>acnA</italic> (aconitase), and <italic>icd</italic> (isocitrate dehydrogenase) would not abrogate growth in contrast to mutations in other TCA cycle genes past the 2-oxoglutarate node.

In agreement with this premise, intracellular citrate concentrations, as an indicator of TCA cycle activity and entry of carbon into the TCA cycle, increased 3-fold during post-exponential growth in CDM compared to exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5B</xref>).

Thus, the net level of NADH may be reduced during growth in CDM below the levels needed to drive oxidative phosphorylation from the staphylococcal NADH:quinone oxidoreductase. Therefore, experiments were designed to determine if respiration is reduced during growth in CDM compared to TSB or CDM containing 14&#x000a0;mM glucose (CDMG).

The lack of growth demonstrated by a succinate dehydrogenase mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">S1L</xref>) and the decreased ATP concentration and oxygen consumption noted during growth in CDM led us to address the importance of the electron transport chain during growth in CDM.

First, aerobic growth of <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> JE2 in CDMG reached an OD<sub>600</sub> maximum of approximately 5.5 following 6&#x000a0;h of growth, at which time glucose was exhausted from the medium (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4A</xref>). In contrast to the results seen with growth in TSB (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and CDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>), acetate was not completely consumed from CDMG, suggesting that growth arrest and subsequent acetate oxidation via the TCA cycle may be halted due to depletion of critical amino acids or other C4/C5 compounds as previously discussed (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), although the exact mechanisms are not clear (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4A</xref>). Amino acid analysis of spent medium demonstrated that aspartate, glutamate, lysine, and the glucogenic amino acids alanine, serine, glycine, and threonine were rapidly depleted from the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>). However, the remaining amino acids, including arginine, histidine, and proline, that are known to generate glutamate during growth in CDM were incompletely utilized following 12&#x000a0;h of growth. In fact, a mutation in <italic>gudB</italic> had little effect on growth in CDMG, in contrast to that observed with growth in CDM (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4B</xref>). As discussed previously, investigations have shown that arginine and proline catabolism is repressed via CcpA and carbon catabolite repression (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, following glucose consumption at 6&#x000a0;h of growth, rapid arginine and/or proline catabolism was not observed. Furthermore, no growth was observed in CDMG when proline (CDMG-P) or arginine (CDMG-R) was subtracted from the medium (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4C</xref>). In contrast, a lack of glutamate in CDMG (CDMG-E) did not result in a significant growth defect (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4C</xref>). NMR analysis performed using <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-labeled glucose confirmed that glucose was metabolized to synthesize glutamate, thus facilitating growth in CDMG-E (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.&#x000a0;S5</xref>). However, almost undetectable levels of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled arginine or proline were detected during growth with CDMG containing <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-labeled glucose, confirming previous data demonstrating that arginine and proline need to be acquired from exogenous sources when <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> grows on preferred carbon sources such as glucose (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that growth of <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> in CDMG results in rapid utilization of glucose, serine, threonine, alanine, glycine, glutamate, lysine, and aspartate. However, proline and arginine, key amino acids that fuel glutamate synthesis under conditions of growth in CDM, are not utilized as a carbon source when glucose is exhausted from CDMG. Both proline and arginine are required for growth in CDMG for utilization during protein synthesis, however, as glutamate does not serve as a substrate for their synthesis. Lastly, it is unclear how lysine is rapidly utilized during growth in CDMG, as pathways that function to catabolize lysine were not identified in <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> FPR3757 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="figS4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mBio.01434-16.4</object-id><label>FIG&#x000a0;S4&#x000a0;</label><p>Growth of <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> JE2 in CDMG.

Therefore, it was hypothesized that the conversion of histidine to glutamate, in addition to the conversion of arginine and proline to glutamate via pyrolline-5 carboxylate and RocA and the subsequent conversion of glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate via GudB, would also be CcpA repressed, as these reactions would be necessary only if there were no other preferred carbon sources available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>).

Furthermore, as predicted, transcription of <italic>putA</italic>, <italic>rocD</italic>, <italic>rocA</italic>, <italic>gudB</italic>, and <italic>rocF</italic> was detected during exponential growth in CDM. Transcription of <italic>hutU</italic>, in contrast, was detected only in the JE2 <italic>ccpA</italic>::<italic>tetL</italic> mutant in the exponential phase of growth and not in the exponential phase of growth of wild-type JE2. On the basis of the NMR and amino acid utilization data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), we predicted that <italic>hutU</italic> transcript would be detected in the post-exponential-growth phase following proline and arginine depletion in CDM, but we were unable to detect this transcript during our initial studies. In addition, <italic>hutU</italic> transcript was not detected in CDMG, even in the <italic>ccpA</italic> mutant. These data may suggest that growth arrest occurs in CDMG before potentially multiple regulatory networks induce <italic>hutU</italic> expression.

Nevertheless, recent studies have found that <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> can adapt to changing levels of carbon sources and oxygen availability found within specific organ systems. For example, Hammer and colleagues determined that <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> bacteria defective in aerobic respiration were unable to mediate infection in the heart or liver but that colonization and abscess formation in the kidney were unaffected (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Complementing these findings, <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> mutants defective in anaerobic fermentation were less virulent than the wild type in a mouse model of kidney infection (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Additionally, mutants defective in CcpA were less effective at infecting the liver where glucose was abundant, but the infection burden in the kidney was not affected (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Thus, taken together, these data suggest that <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> uses distinct central metabolic pathways to adapt to the different carbon or oxygen sources that are available within the organ system or site of infection.</p><p>An elegant model has emerged demonstrating how <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> survives within a staphylococcal abscess (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The antimicrobial action of NO occurs at multiple nodes of central metabolism, including the TCA cycle and respiration. However, the NO concentration at the center of staphylococcal abscesses is thought to be below 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, allowing respiration and other metabolic processes to be functional (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Furthermore, glucose is depleted due to phagocytic cell activity, whereas lactate is abundant due to excretion during staphylococcal growth (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Thus, the major carbon sources for <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> at the center of abscesses are lactate and peptides. Lactate is utilized via lactate quinone oxidoreductase (Lqo), which generates pyruvate and subsequently acetate via Pta/AckA, whereas peptides provide a carbon source for gluconeogenesis. The goal of the study was to assess amino acid catabolism and to determine the importance of particular amino acid catabolic pathways during growth without glucose or other preferred carbon sources.</p><p>Bioinformatic analyses of USA300 LAC (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) found that <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> has the potential ability to catabolize 11&#x000a0;amino acids to pyruvate, oxaloacetate, or 2-oxoglutarate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material). It should be noted that these pathways are predicted and that novel pathways could be present in <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic>. However, growth in CDM and subsequent amino acid analysis verified the predictions for 10 of the 11&#x000a0;amino acids. Our results are similar to those of previously published studies assessing amino acid catabolism or utilization in <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic>, although the media used varied slightly in these studies (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The lone amino acid not catabolized, but predicted based on bioinformatics analyses, was cysteine. This result may have occurred because CDM contains MgSO<sub>4</sub> as a sulfur source. It is well established that <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> cannot utilize sulfate, sulfite, or sulfonates as the source of sulfur in cysteine biosynthesis, whereas it can use thiosulfate, sulfide, or glutathione (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Thus, we predict that a feedback mechanism exists for repressing cysteine catabolism if an appropriate sulfur source for cysteine synthesis is not present. In addition, we observed that lysine was catabolized when <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> was grown in CDMG but not CDM. Some species are known to ferment lysine to acetate (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), but metabolic pathways to perform this function are not immediately recognized in the <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> genome.</p><p>Glutamate is the major amino donor for most anabolic enzymatic reactions and yet also functions as a key intermediate in carbon metabolism (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Our results suggest that glutamate, and those amino acids that can be converted into glutamate, serves as a central carbon source to facilitate growth in media lacking a preferred carbon source such as glucose. First, glutamate dehydrogenase (GudB), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate, is required for growth in CDM. In addition, all enzymes (excluding Mqo1, which is rescued by anaplerotic reactions generating oxaloacetate) that function in the TCA cycle downstream of 2-oxoglutarate, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PckA), which generates PEP from oxaloacetate, are required. Thus, glutamate fuels the TCA cycle allowing subsequent gluconeogenic reactions and presumably serves as the major amino group donor to cellular reactions.</p><p>Second, although NMR analysis found that <sup>13</sup>C carbon from all of the amino acids tested eventually was incorporated into glutamate, only mutations in those genes that code for enzymes that function to generate glutamate from proline resulted in a significant growth defect. Other than arginine, histidine, and proline, all amino acids must generate glutamate via the TCA cycle and glutamate synthase (GOGAT). However, a mutation in <italic>gltB</italic> (encoding a large subunit of glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase [GOGAT]; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1X</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material) conferred no growth defect in CDM, suggesting that the importance of glutamate synthesis from amino acids other than proline and histidine is minimal. As indicated by NMR, arginine can also be directly converted to glutamate by the arginase pathway (RocF-RocD-RocA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). Alternatively, independently of RocF, arginine deiminase (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) can synthesize ornithine from arginine, which can then be catabolized to glutamate via RocD and RocA. However, individual <italic>rocF</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1F</xref>) and <italic>arcA1 arcA2</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1R</xref>) mutants did not have a growth defect in CDM, whereas a <italic>rocF arcA1 arcA2</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1S</xref>) mutant had only a post-exponential growth defect, suggesting that arginine catabolism does not significantly contribute to exponential growth. However, it was surprising that a <italic>rocD</italic> mutant had a growth phenotype in CDM similar to that of the <italic>rocA</italic> mutant (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1Y</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Z</xref>); RocD converts ornithine, which can be synthesized from arginine via RocF, to P5C (1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). Since the <italic>rocF</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1F</xref>) mutant did not have a significant growth defect, one would predict that a <italic>rocD</italic> mutant would phenocopy a <italic>rocF</italic> mutant. <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> also encodes a nitric oxide synthase (<italic>nos</italic>), which catalyzes the formation of citrulline from arginine, generating NO (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Thus, it is possible that arginine is primarily catabolized via NOS and not arginase or arginine deiminase during growth in CDM, but whether this is the case is currently unknown. Nevertheless, complementing these genetic findings, comparison of NMR peak intensities suggested that the level of glutamate synthesized via proline was approximately 5 times and 6 times that synthesized from arginine in the exponential and post-exponential phases, respectively, and was approximately 5 times and 2.5 times that synthesized from histidine in the exponential and post-exponential phases, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). Thus, as our NMR and amino acid utilization data demonstrate, histidine is utilized after proline levels become limiting. Collectively, our data suggest that proline is the primary substrate for glutamate synthesis during exponential phase and that histidine is utilized once proline is limiting. Furthermore, arginine is a minor source of glutamate synthesis in both the exponential and post-exponential phases of growth.</p><p>Lastly, we found that the entire metabolic pathway that functions to catabolize both proline and arginine is under carbon catabolite and CcpA control. Thus, proline, histidine, and arginine are catabolized only when glucose is limiting. However, why is proline the primary source of glutamate when <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> is growing without glucose? We have previously proposed a model whereby arginine is rapidly depleted within an abscess due to its preferential uptake by host innate immune cells for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), arginase (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), and cell-mediated (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) immunity, effectively reducing the amount of free extracellular arginine available in the microenvironment. Previous studies have shown significant induction of both iNOS and arginase expression during <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> abscess formation (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), further suggesting that arginine depletion occurs at the infection site. Although nothing is known regarding the concentration of free proline or histidine in a staphylococcal infection, proline is the second-most-abundant amino acid found in collagen, which is the most abundant protein in animals (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Indeed, collagen is a major constituent of the fibrotic wall surrounding a staphylococcal abscess (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). We hypothesize that <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> uses a combination of host-derived proteases, known to be induced to facilitate tissue remodeling during abscess formation (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), and its own proteases that are known to degrade collagen (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) to liberate free proline or proline-containing peptides that are subsequently utilized by <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> to synthesize arginine and glutamate. Thus, since proline is likely to be present at high concentrations in abscesses and can be transformed to both arginine and glutamate, it is proposed that <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> has evolved to rapidly synthesize both glutamate and arginine from proline when preferred carbon sources such as glucose are lacking.</p><p>We also propose that catabolism of the glucogenic amino acids (e.g., serine, threonine, and alanine) during growth in CDM functions primarily to generate acetate and ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation. Several observations suggested that conversion of acetyl-CoA to 2-oxoglutarate is most active in the post-exponential phase during growth in CDM. First, acetate consumption, as an indicator of TCA cycle activity, is observed during the post-exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). Second, citrate concentrations, another indicator of TCA cycle activity, increase significantly in the post-exponential phase during growth in CDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5A</xref>). Third, in contrast to the results seen with TCA cycle enzymes that function to generate oxaloacetate from 2-oxoglutarate, mutations in <italic>gltA</italic>, <italic>acnA</italic>, or <italic>icd</italic> do not abrogate growth. Thus, we propose that the glucogenic amino acids are catabolized to acetate via Pta/AckA and secreted. The acetate is subsequently catabolized via the TCA cycle in the post-exponential phase since acetate represents a secondary carbon source. This supposition is supported by the findings indicating that <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glutamate was primarily detected in the post-exponential phase when CDM was supplemented with <sup>13</sup>C-labeled alanine, serine, or threonine. Glutamate can be synthesized from these amino acids only via TCA cycle activity and generation of glutamate via GOGAT and 2-oxoglutarate.</p><p>Why is a mutation in <italic>ackA</italic> deleterious to growth in CDM? Although a mutation in <italic>ackA</italic> is detrimental to growth in TSB, it does not completely abrogate growth but instead enhances glycolytic flux and diverts carbon to the TCA cycle (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). We first hypothesized that the ATP generated via AckA was fundamentally important due to a decrease in ATP generation via the respiratory chain during growth in CDM. However, although we found that oxygen consumption, ATP synthesis, and the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio are significantly decreased during growth in CDM compared to TSB, we found that mutations in NADH dehydrogenase and quinol oxidase were also deleterious to growth. In addition, time-kill curve experiments performed using the ATP synthase inhibitor DCCD halted growth in CDM whereas growth was unaffected in TSB and CDMG. Thus, we propose that the ATP generated from both AckA and ATP synthase via respiratory activity is important for growth in CDM. Indeed, amino acid transport requires ATP and is a more energy-intensive process than carbohydrate transport, which is facilitated through the phosphotransferase (PTS) system. Supporting this notion, anaerobic growth of JE2 in CDM required both lactate and nitrate and was <italic>gudB</italic> and <italic>ackA</italic> dependent. These data suggest that glutamate catabolism, substrate-level phosphorylation, and ATP derived from anaerobic respiration were all required for growth in an anaerobic environment which mimicked the anoxic environment found in an abscess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.&#x000a0;6C</xref>). Alternatively, the lack of growth in CDM with an <italic>ackA</italic> mutant may be linked to recycling of coenzyme A, which is required for the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate and succinyl-CoA via SucA (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). However, it is unclear how a mutation in <italic>ackA</italic> would affect activity of Pta, which functions to generate acetyl phosphate while regenerating CoA. Additionally, recent studies have documented that an <italic>ackA</italic> mutant generates a redox imbalance in <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Thus, the growth phenotype observed with the <italic>ackA</italic> mutant may be multifactorial.</p><p>Finally, multiple pathways fueling glutamate catabolism (synthesis from proline, arginine, and histidine) are all under the control of repression of CcpA and thus are active only when preferred carbon sources such as glucose are depleted. This provides a rapid mechanism to facilitate growth using amino acids as carbon sources when glucose is not available. However, it is unclear why growth of JE2 in CDM-R is dependent upon a mutation in <italic>ccpA</italic>. One would expect that CcpA repression would be alleviated during growth in CDM without a preferred carbon source available. However, we did not observe growth of JE2 in CDM-R, and growth of the JE2 <italic>ccpA</italic>::<italic>tetL</italic> mutant in CDM-R was dependent upon <italic>putA</italic>, suggesting that proline was the source of arginine, as previously described (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This observation may suggest that regulation of the urea cycle may involve multiple layers of regulation, including CcpA regulation. In addition, GudB in <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> is upregulated by the presence of proline, arginine, or ornithine (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>); thus, it is possible that <italic>gudB</italic> transcription requires arginine, at least in the presence of CcpA, to be fully functional. However, it should be noted that slight growth of JE2 in CDM-R was observed after 24 to 30&#x000a0;h of growth, but the significance of this observation is not clear (data not shown).</p><p>In conclusion, we have found that glutamate, and those amino acids that serve to fuel its synthesis, are central carbon sources during growth in medium lacking glucose. In addition, the glucogenic amino acids are catabolized to generate acetate and produce ATP via AckA; the ATP generated via this reaction is critical for growth in medium lacking glucose such as CDM. Further work is required to determine the function and expression of these catabolic pathways to determine their importance <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions.</title><p>The <italic>S.&#x000a0;aureus</italic> strains used in this study were all derived from JE2 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).
