We investigated how the metastasis suppressor, SSeCKS, attenuates chemotaxis. Chemotaxis activity inversely correlated with SSeCKS levels in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF), DU145 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. SSeCKS loss induced chemotactic velocity and linear directionality, correlating with replacement of leading edge lamellipodia with fascin-enriched filopodia-like extensions, the formation of thickened longitudinal F-actin stress fibers reaching to filopodial tips, relative enrichments at the leading edge of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)P3 (PIP3), Akt, PKC-&#x003b6;, Cdc42-GTP and active Src (Src<sup>poY416</sup>), and a loss of Rac1. Leading edge lamellipodia and chemotaxis inhibition in SSeCKS-null MEF could be restored by full-length SSeCKS or SSeCKS deleted of its Src-binding domain (&#x00394;Src), but not by SSeCKS deleted of its three MARCKS (myristylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) polybasic domains (&#x00394;PBD), which bind PIP2 and PIP3. The enrichment of activated Cdc42 in SSeCKS-null leading edge filopodia correlated with recruitment of the Cdc42-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Frabin, likely recruited via multiple PIP2/3-binding domains. Frabin knockdown in SSeCKS-null MEF restores leading edge lamellipodia and chemotaxis inhibition. However, SSeCKS failed to co-immunoprecipitate with Rac1, Cdc42 or Frabin. Consistent with the notion that chemotaxis is controlled by SSeCKS-PIP (vs. -Src) scaffolding activity, constitutively-active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase could override the ability of the Src inhibitor, SKI-606, to suppress chemotaxis and filopodial enrichment of Frabin in SSeCKS-null MEF. Our data suggest a role for SSeCKS in controlling Rac1 vs. Cdc42-induced cellular dynamics at the leading chemotactic edge through the scaffolding of phospholipids and signal mediators, and through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton controlling directional movement.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by National Cancer Institute grants CA94108, CA116430, and Department of Defense grants PC074228, PC101210 to IHG, and in part, through National Cancer Institute Comprehensive Cancer Center funds (P30-CA016056).

In most motile cells, the leading edge is characterized by a fan-like lamellipodium lacking mature focal adhesion plaques and large F-actin stress fibers, with periodic filopodia protrusions seemingly pushed out by F-actin bundles <xref rid="pone.0111534-Roussos1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

The predominance of Rac-directed lamellipodia formation at leading edges likely relates to increased generation and enrichment of PIP3, due to the activation of chemoattractant receptors that increase local PI3K activity levels <xref rid="pone.0111534-Chalhoub1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

Characteristics that define scaffolding proteins include multiple, independent protein binding domains, the ability to multimerize (and thereby, amplify signal mediation), and the ability to translocate between cellular domains or compartments (thereby partnering scaffolded signaling enzymes with appropriate substrates).</p><p>SSeCKS (<underline>S</underline>rc-<underline>S</underline>uppr<underline>e</underline>ssed <underline>C K</underline>inase <underline>S</underline>ubstrate), the rodent ortholog of human A Kinase Anchoring Protein (AKAP)-12 (or Gravin), is a metastasis suppressor that attenuates oncogenic signaling and motility pathways through its multiple scaffolding domains for signaling mediators such as protein kinase (PK) C and PKA, cyclins, Src and calmodulin <xref rid="pone.0111534-Gelman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In addition to an F-actin binding domain involved with association with the actin cytoskeleton, SSeCKS also encodes three so-called MARCKS-like PBD known to bind various phosphoinositol phosphates (PIP)<xref rid="pone.0111534-McLaughlin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, which, in addition to the N-terminal myristylation of the &#x003b1;SSeCKS isoform <xref rid="pone.0111534-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, facilitates plasma membrane association <xref rid="pone.0111534-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The downregulation of SSeCKS expression is associated with cancer malignancy parameters such as metastasis and recurrence <xref rid="pone.0111534-Gelman2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and indeed, SSeCKS is downregulated by oncogenes known to be especially activated in cancer malignancy such as Src, Ras and Myc <xref rid="pone.0111534-Gelman3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In addition to suppressing metastasis by inhibiting tumor-specific expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)<xref rid="pone.0111534-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, SSeCKS inhibits parameters of oncogenic motility, such as invasiveness and chemotaxis <xref rid="pone.0111534-Su2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, by re-establishing normalized cytoskeletal architecture including stress fiber and focal adhesion plaque formation.

<xref rid="pone.0111534-Su3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Recent evidence indicates that SSeCKS suppresses oncogenic cell motility by directly scaffolding Src and sequestering pools from integrin/growth factor receptor/FAK-enriched plasma membrane domains to lipid rafts, thereby disengaging Src from adhesion- or growth factor-induced activation of MEK-ERK pathways that control pro-oncogenic actin-based cytoskeletal reorganization and podosome formation <xref rid="pone.0111534-Su3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>In the current study, we addressed the role of SSeCKS in controlling the cellular structures and Rho family GTPases involved in chemotaxis. Chemotaxis by mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) or human cancer cell lines, DU145 or MDA-MB-231, could be enhanced by SSeCKS knockdown or genetic loss, or suppressed by forced SSeCKS expression. SSeCKS-deficient cells exhibited increased directional motility towards chemoattractants, marked by thickened, longitudinal F-actin stress fibers ending in predominantly filopodial protrusions at the leading edge. Additionally, the leading edges of SSeCKS-deficient cells showed enrichments of PIP3, activated Cdc42 and Src, and the Cdc42-specific GEF, Frabin. The ability of SSeCKS to rescue formation of leading edge lamellipodia and to suppress chemotaxis required the three PBD, which we show here bind PIP2 and PIP3. Although Src activity was required for chemotaxis, SSeCKS&#x02019; ability to suppress chemotaxis did not require its Src scaffolding activity. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that SSeCKS suppresses chemotaxis by differentially organizing PIP3, Rho-family GTPases and their regulatory proteins, Src and regulators of actin cytoskeletal remodeling at the leading edge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and SSeCKS&#x02212;/&#x02212; (KO) primary mouse MEF were derived from E13.5 embryos as described previously <xref rid="pone.0111534-Akakura1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

Following three PBS washes (10 min each at RT), the cells were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with either mAb anti-GST or mAb anti-His and washed three times with PBS. Incubation with secondary Abs (1&#x02236;1000 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at RT included either goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 or Alexa Fluor 488, or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 or Alexa Fluor 488. F-actin filaments were stained with rhodamine- or FITC-conjugated phalloidin, and nuclei were stained with 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Following staining, cells were washed with PBS and then sealed under coverslips with a drop of Prolong anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen). The fluorescent images were acquired on an inverted microscope (Nikon TE 2000) using a 60x oil immersion objective.

For quantitative measurements of fluorescence at the leading edges of cells, a cell&#x02019;s chemotactic leading edge (a 0.5 &#x000b5;m mask into the cell starting from periphery) was traced and the average fluorescence intensity (in pixels) was measured using ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>).

To address this, we performed PIP-strip overlay assays, in which nitrocellulose membranes spotted with 15 phospholipids were incubated with GST fusions of various SSeCKS domains. After washing, the bound proteins were identified by immunoblotting for GST antigen. GST-SSeCKS fusions containing PBD1 and 2 (a.a. 2&#x02013;274 and 275&#x02013;390) showed binding activity to phosphatidic acid (PA) but not to phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS) or phosphatidylcholine (PC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111534-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). All three PBD bound to the mono-, di- and tri-phosphorylated PI, whereas no binding was detected to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) or sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P). All three PBD strongly bound PI(3)P, PI(4)P or PI(5)P, as well as the PIP2 and PIP3 lipids, although PBD3 preferred PI(3,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111534-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). As a negative control, GST alone or GST-SSeCKS fusions not containing PBD failed to bind any of the lipids on the strip. Based on the notion that the MARCKS membrane effector domain binds acidic lipids through its concentration of positively-charged lysine and arginine residues <xref rid="pone.0111534-McLaughlin1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, we employed a solution-based binding assay of GST-SSeCKS proteins to PIP-beads.

The difference between the two assays is unclear, however, the PIP-bead assay binding kinetics are shorter, suggesting that the binding conditions for the PIP Strip favor saturation of the GST-SSeCKS fusion proteins.

Re-expression of full-length (FL)-SSeCKS in KO MEF restored lamellipodia formation, similar to the effects found in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111534-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>), as well as the GFP-PH-AKT edge staining pattern found in WT MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111534-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

However, &#x00394;PBD-SSeCKS overexpression failed to alter the typical stress fiber formation in KO MEF. The ability of SSeCKS to alter PIP3 levels at the leading edge was assessed by measuring relative GFP-PH-AKT staining intensities 0.5 &#x000b5;m from the leading cell edge as a fraction of total cell GFP-PH-AKT staining, normalized for cell volume. KO MEF exhibited 2.5-fold more PIP3 enrichment at their leading edges compared to levels in WT MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111534-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

In contrast, stress fibers in SSeCKS-expressing cells were thinner, and ended in angled bunches prior to the leading edge of lamellipodia. Our data suggest that the actin cytoskeletal remodeling mechanisms that SSeCKS suppresses results in decreased directional motility and velocity.</p><p>The ability of SSeCKS to attenuate chemotaxis is likely controlled by its direct scaffolding of phosphoinositol phosphates via three domains, PBD1-3. The PBD share homology, specifically a concentration of phenylalanine and lysine residues, with the so-called MARCKS membrane effector domain shown previously to bind various PIPs <xref rid="pone.0111534-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. It is also likely that these domains, in conjunction with SSeCKS&#x02019; N-terminal myristylation, direct SSeCKS to specific plasma membrane regions temporally enriched with PIP2/3, such as the motile leading edge <xref rid="pone.0111534-Kay1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> or lipid rafts in non-motile cells <xref rid="pone.0111534-Rozelle1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Indeed, Yan <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0111534-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> showed that the PBD were sufficient to target human SSeCKS (AKAP12/Gravin) to membrane sites. Importantly, our data showed that the ability of SSeCKS to inhibit chemotaxis in MEF and MDA-MB-231 cells required the three PBD but not the Src scaffolding domain, strongly arguing that SSeCKS controls chemotaxis through competitive binding to or compartmentalization of PIPs. An argument against the former possibility is that SSeCKS levels do not correlate with changes in AKT protein or activation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111534-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), which might be expected that if SSeCKS competed with the AKT-PH domain for PIP binding. However, our results are consistent with the latter possibility, namely that SSeCKS alters the level of active AKT enriching at the leading edge, most likely influenced by SSeCKS&#x02019; ability to attenuate the enrichment of PIP3, and to a lesser extent PIP2, in these protrusions.</p><p>The notion that SSeCKS regulates chemotaxis through the physical scaffolding and organization of PIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111534-g009">Fig. 9</xref>), and the subsequent selective enrichment of signaling proteins at the leading edge was strengthened by our data showing increased levels of AKT, PKC-&#x003b6; and Cdc42 at the leading edge of KO vs. WT MEF, although total cellular levels of these proteins were unaffected by SSeCKS. The exception was the polarity protein, Par6, normally recruited to the leading edge by activated Cdc42, which was not enriched in KO cell leading edges. Indeed, SSeCKS directly scaffolds PKC-&#x003b6;, as it does for other PKC isoform classes <xref rid="pone.0111534-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, suggesting a direct mechanism for affecting localization. It is noteworthy that we could not show co-IP of AKT or Cdc42 with SSeCKS suggesting that SSeCKS affects their membrane localization indirectly. These recruitments correlated with increased levels of activated Cdc42 (GTP-bound) in KO cell leading edges as assessed by overlay assays with epitope-tagged WASP-CBD domains and by purification of chemosensing pseudopodia. In contrast, KO and WT leading edges showed no difference in the binding of epitope-tagged PAK-PBD, which recognizes both activated Rac and Cdc42 [effector binding domains specific for activated Rac alone have not been identified]. Taken together with our findings that KO cell leading edges have relatively decreased levels of total Rac1 yet increased levels of activated Cdc42, it is likely that our PAK-PBD result suggests that SSeCKS normally facilitates localization of Rac1 to activation sites on the motile leading edge. Consistent with this, the overexpression of CA-Rac1 was sufficient to induce leading edge lamellipodia in KO MEF, as was the overexpression of DN-Cdc42.</p><p>Our data demonstrated that the Cdc42-specific GEF, Frabin, was selectively enriched at the tips of filopodia-like protrusions at the leading edge of KO MEF, compared with little or no enrichment at leading edge lamellipodia in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111534-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). This enrichment is likely facilitated by multiple PIP-binding domains encoded by Frabin. Indeed, re-expression of FL- or &#x00394;Src-SSeCKS, but not &#x00394;PBD-SSeCKS, induced lamellipodial protrusions at the leading edge which were relatively devoid of Frabin enrichment. Conversely, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of Frabin suppressed the formation of leading edge filopodia and enhanced chemotaxis in KO MEF. This argues that in the absence of SSeCKS, Frabin is responsible for the selective activation of Cdc42 at leading edges, resulting in the formation of filopodia during chemotaxis <xref rid="pone.0111534-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Why the SSeCKS-Frabin-Cdc42 axis controls single-cell chemotaxis vs. monolayer wound healing motility dynamics is unclear. However, it is possible that wound healing motility is less dependent on this control axis because it reflects collective migration driven by changes in adhesion tension at each cell&#x02019;s leading edge. In contrast, chemotaxis is driven by an enrichment of chemoattractant receptors (e.g.- PDGFR) at the leading edge. Thus, scaffolding proteins, such as SSeCKS, that can locally regulate Src/PI3K/AKT signaling, PIP generation and Rac1/Cdc42 activation/localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111534-g009">Fig. 9</xref>), might play critical roles in regulating chemotaxis vs. collective migration.</p><p>Although SSeCKS can control adhesion- and growth factor- signaling by directly scaffolding pools of active Src away from FAK complexes <xref rid="pone.0111534-Su3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, this activity was not required for SSeCKS&#x02019; ability to rescue lamellipodia formation and chemotaxis inhibition. This notion that Src plays a generic role (i.e.- not involved in SSeCKS&#x02019; chemotaxis control) is borne out by our data that Src kinase inhibition suppressed WT and KO cell chemotaxis equally. However, PI3K, and its ability to generate PIP3, is likely downstream of Src in our system because CA-PI3K could negate the ability of SKI-606 to suppress chemotaxis and Frabin localization at leading edge filopodia in KO cells. Additionally, CA-PI3K increased chemotaxis equally in WT or KO cells, although it was not sufficient to induce any of the leading edge phenotypes found in KO cells. Therefore, it is likely that SSeCKS controls chemotaxis through a spatial scaffolding of PIPs, resulting in the recruitment of signaling mediators and cytoskeletal architecture that favors Cdc42-induced filopodia formation and directional motility. If this putative scaffolding function plays a role in SSeCKS&#x02019; ability to suppress metastasis, this implies that the loss of SSeCKS in advanced cancer <xref rid="pone.0111534-Gelman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> facilitates metastatic cell motility parameters (e.g.- directional chemotaxis and invasiveness) through the selective activation of Cdc42 and its cytoskeletal remodeling pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0111534.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
