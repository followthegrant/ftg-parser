Possible techniques include those utilizing two separate grafts with independent tunnels and those that attempt to mimic this anatomy with a single graft and fewer tunnels. Many of the latter techniques require specific instrumentation and are technically challenging. We demonstrate that the double-bundle anatomy of the native ACL can theoretically be mimicked by a single-bundle reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed single bundle ACL reconstruction with a bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) graft in two cadaveric knees. Both grafts were placed to mimic the native ACL footprints &#x02013; one reconstruction was performed with rectangular bone blocks and oval tunnels and one was performed utilizing a standard BTB graft and round tunnels. Qualitative assessment of graft behavior was made as the knees were taken through a range of motion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The ACL graft was able to qualitatively mimic the behavior of the native ACL in both knees provided the bone blocks were correctly orientated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>ACL reconstruction with a single BTB graft can qualitatively mimic the behavior of the two bundles of the native ACL. The key to ensuring this behavior was noted to be appropriate orientation of the graft in the tunnels. Quantitative biomechanical investigations are necessary to evaluate the impact of graft orientation on function.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Improvements in understanding of the anatomy and function of the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) have lead to increasing interest in reconstructing both bundles of the ACL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Different techniques utilizing a variety of grafts, tibial and femoral tunnel configurations, and fixation methods have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Some biomechanical studies have demonstrated increased overall stability following double-bundle reconstruction relative to a single-bundle technique, while others have not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Further, while some clinical studies have demonstrated improved stability measurements with double-bundle techniques, improved clinical outcomes have not been consistently demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Double-bundle reconstruction techniques are not without drawbacks. Many described techniques require the surgeon to prepare three or four different tunnels, requiring the surgeon to place tunnels very precisely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The steep learning curve can lead to complications and potentially increase operative time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Because surgeons performing less than 50 reconstructions per year perform the vast majority of ACL reconstructions, development of a simplified technique for creating a double-bundle-like construct would be advantageous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>While a technique that mimics double bundle anatomy with a single bone-patellar tendon-bone graft has been previously described, this method requires creation of rectangular tunnels, requiring significant surgical expertise and specific instrumentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We demonstrate that the double-bundle anatomy of the native ACL can be mimicked by a single-bundle reconstruction utilizing rectangular bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts and oval tunnels or with standard grafts and tunnels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Specimen preparation</title><p>Two fresh cadaveric knees were used for this feasibility study, including the knee of an 82&#x02009;year-old female (knee A) and a 78&#x02009;year-old male (knee B). Neither knee had undergone prior surgery and both were noted to have normal ACL&#x02019;s. Some mild degenerative changes of the patellofemoral joint were present in knee A, while the other knee was free of osteoarthritis. To obtain an optimal visualization of the native ACL, the femur, tibia and fibula were cut above and below the knee though their respective diaphyses. Surrounding soft tissues were then removed, leaving only the menisci and cruciate and collateral ligaments.</p><p>The medial half of the distal femur was removed with a sagittal saw cut along with the medial collateral ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, and medial meniscus. The anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles of the ACL were identified and separated. For improved visualization, the AM bundle was colored in red and the PL bundle in blue. This preparation allowed a clear medial view of the native ACL and its two bundles during full range of motion. Following photographic documentation of the native ligament and the orientation of the two bundles in flexion and extension, the bundles were resected and their femoral and tibial attachment sites were marked with the respective color of each bundle.</p></sec><sec><title>Graft harvest and preparation</title><p>Before the knee was dissected as detailed above, a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft was harvested from the central aspect of the patellar tendon. For knee A, the bone blocks were rectangular in shape (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>a). From the lateral view, the thickness of the bone blocks was identical to that of the patellar tendon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>b). For better visualization a longitudinal cut was performed to separate the tendon into two separate parts, which were colored in red and blue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>a-c). For knee B, a conventional graft was harvested and sized to fit into 10&#x02009;mm bone tunnels. The graft was divided with a longitudinal cut and colored in an identical manner to that described for knee A.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Single bundle graft.</bold> The graft utilized in Knee A was created with rectangular tibial and patellar bone blocks. <bold>a</bold>) An anterior view demonstrates that the graft has been divided with a longitudinal incision.

Due to the proximity of the two tunnels to each other, they merged and resulted in oval tunnels on the femur and tibia centered over the native ACL attachment sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The prepared graft was inserted into the tunnels with the red part representing the AM bundle and the blue part the PL bundle. The graft was fixated for this feasibility study by simple trans-osseous sutures.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>ACL footprint and tunnel position. </bold><bold>a</bold>) A medial view of the femur of knee A following resection of the native ACL.

The graft was oriented similarly to that in knee A, with the red part oriented toward the anteromedial portion of the footprint on the femur and tibia and the blue part oriented toward the posterolateral bundle footprints. Fixation was achieved by a press fit technique, preventing rotation of the bone blocks in the tunnels.</p></sec><sec><title>Observation of graft behavior</title><p>The orientation of the grafts in both knees were photographically documented as the knees were brought through a range of motion from the extended to flexed position.

On the tibia, the AM inserted anterior to the PL bundle. In full extension, the bundles were nearly parallel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Following flexion of the knee to 120 degrees, the AM bundle was noted to cross over the PL bundle, which maintained a more vertical orientation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Physiologic and reconstructed ACL movement pattern.</bold> A medial view of the native ACL of knee A in full extension (<bold>a</bold>) and flexion (<bold>b</bold>).

At 120&#x000b0; of knee flexion the red portion of the graft (representing the AM bundle) was noted to cross over the blue portion of the graft (representing the PL bundle), which maintained a relatively vertical orientation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). The same pattern was noted in knee B in both flexion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>E) and extension (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>F). The behavior in both reconstructed knees was qualitatively quite similar to that observed in the native ACL.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main finding of this cadaver feasibility study was that a single bundle patellar tendon graft can mimic the anatomy of the two ACL bundles, provided that it is oriented such that the fibers leaving the anteromedial portion of the ACL tibial footprint and enter the femur near the native femoral origin site of the AM bundle. It was demonstrated that such behavior could be produced not only through the use of oval tunnels, but also through the use of conventional round tunnels.</p><p>There are several theoretical advantages to reconstructing the ACL with one graft. First the necessity to use four bone tunnels and four independent fixation devices is avoided, reducing cost and potentially operative time. Second, significant bone loss can occur due to tunnel enlargement following double bundle ACL reconstruction, particularly if tunnel convergence occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Revision can be quite difficult in these cases, often requiring two stages. Third, this technique is possible even in knees with a small native ACL footprint in which double bundle reconstruction may be contra-indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Potential shortcoming of this technique must also be considered. First, independent tensioning of the different bundles as is performed in double bundle reconstructions is not possible with the described technique. The importance of this limitation should be investigated in a biomechanical study.</p><p>The concept of mimicking the double bundle anatomy of the native ACL using one graft placed through a single tibial and femoral tunnel is not new. Several authors have described fixation techniques that allow soft tissue grafts to be used in this manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Shino et al. previously have previously evaluated a similar technique to mimic double bundle function with a single BTB graft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. They demonstrated that such reconstructions were technically possible in clinical setting and emphasized appropriate graft orientation as in the current study. They did encounter complications while attempting to create rectangular tunnels in the femur including posterior wall blowout, emphasizing the difficulty of this technique.</p><p>This cadaveric feasibility study has several weaknesses. First, the focus of the study is to demonstrate qualitatively the behavior of the ACL graft. No attempts were made to quantitatively assess behavior by assessing tension in the different parts of the graft. In addition, the reconstruction was performed in an open manner without utilizing standard arthroscopic instrumentation. The feasibility of performing such a reconstruction <italic>in vivo</italic> was thus not assessed. Further, the removal of soft tissue from the single specimen precluded the performance of any useful mechanical testing of the reconstructed knee to determine the effect of graft orientation on stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A single bundle patellar tendon ACL reconstruction can mimic qualitatively the behavior of the two bundles of the native ACL if the graft is correctly positioned relative to the ACL footprint on the femur and tibia.
