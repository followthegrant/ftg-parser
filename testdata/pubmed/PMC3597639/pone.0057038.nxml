We compared Wistar rat retinal wholemounts in animals aged 3 (young adult), 9 (middle-aged) and 22 months (aged). We determined that retinal astrocytes have gap junctions composed of Cx26, -30, -43 and -45. Cx30 was consistently elevated at 22 months compared to younger ages both when associated with parenchymal astrocytes and vascular-associated astrocytes. Not only was the absolute number of Cx30 plaques significantly higher (P&#x0003c;0.05) but the size of the plaques was significantly larger at 22 months compared to younger ages (p&#x0003c;0.05). With age, Cx26 increased significantly initially, but returned to basal levels; whereas Cx43 expression remained low and stable with age. Evidence that astrocytes alter connexin compositions of gap junctions was demonstrated by the significant increase in the number of Cx26/Cx45 gap junctions with age. We also found gap junctions comprised of 1, 2, 3 or 4 Cx proteins suggesting that retinal astrocytes use various connexin protein combinations in their gap junctions during development and aging. These data provides new insight into the dynamic and extensive Cx network utilized by retinal astrocytes for communication within both the parenchyma and vasculature for the maintenance of normal retinal physiology with age. This characterisation of the changes in astrocytic gap junctional communication with age in the CNS is crucial to the understanding of physiological aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants to TC-L from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (Nos. 1005730 and 571100), the Baxter Charitable Foundation, the Rebecca L.

Many of these astrocyte functions are mediated via gap junction (GJ) communication. Astrocyte gap junctions are formed by two hemi-channels (connexons) composed of individual homo- or hetero-hexamers of connexin (Cx) proteins. An extended field of GJs is referred to as a gap junctional plaque [for a review <xref rid="pone.0057038-Bloomfield1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>]. To date, four connexin proteins have been found in astrocytes: Cx26 <xref rid="pone.0057038-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, Cx30 <xref rid="pone.0057038-Kunzelmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, Cx43 <xref rid="pone.0057038-Giaume1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and Cx45 <xref rid="pone.0057038-Beyer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and various combinations of hexameric Cx proteins determine the types of ions and small molecules that are able to pass from the cytoplasm of one cell into the next. Thus the connexin make-up of gap-junctions has a direct influence over astrocyte syncytium communication <xref rid="pone.0057038-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057038-Theis1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057038-Giaume2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Distinct astrocyte subpopulations establish different connexin expression patterns in the CNS depending on the physiological requirements of the tissue <xref rid="pone.0057038-Bachoo1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the retina, astrocytes mostly express Cx43 but can also express Cx30 and Cx45. To date, Cx26 has not been detected in mouse or rat retina <xref rid="pone.0057038-Zahs1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0057038-Zahs1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> studied the expression of Cxs in rat retinal wholemounts and concluded that since gap junction channels may be formed by both homotypic and heterotypic hemichannels, and the hemichannels may be homomeric or heteromeric, there exists a multitude of possible gap junction channels that could underlie the homotypic coupling between retinal astrocytes and the heterotypic coupling between astrocytes and Muller cells.</p><p>In order to better understand how astrocyte networks function in the aged retina, a thorough understanding of astrocyte gap junction communication as a function of aging is required. We have previously shown that astrocytes lose their ability to proliferate after 9 months, equivalent to a young adult in humans, and that the frequency of apoptosis increases significantly and persistently into old age <xref rid="pone.0057038-Mansour1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In contrast, retinal ganglion cell numbers have been shown to remain constant in the rat retina with age <xref rid="pone.0057038-Harman1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Thus during aging a lower astrocyte to neuronal ratio results, placing an increased demand on the remaining astrocytes to maintain retinal homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0057038-Mansour1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that the remaining retinal astrocytes would alter their gap junction connexin expression, and thus communication, to compensate for the significant change in astrocyte to neuron ratio. To date, there has been very limited examination of Cx30 and 43 in the aging CNS, with only one report of decreased Cx30 number in the brain with age <xref rid="pone.0057038-Cotrina1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We undertook a thorough investigation of the aging-associated changes in astrocyte Cx expression in the rat retina with particular emphasis on Cx number, plaque size, as well as a detailed evaluation of the frequency and type of homomeric and heterotypic gap junction intercellular coupling.</p><p>Our earlier work <xref rid="pone.0057038-ChanLing1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057038-ChanLing2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> has shown that the retina is an excellent model of the CNS in both normal development and aging. The absence of oligodendrocytes creates a simplified system for the study of purely astrocyte, neuronal and vascular gap junction communication. The retina has been shown to reflect CNS changes with aging, including changes in the astrocytes <xref rid="pone.0057038-Mansour1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, pericytes <xref rid="pone.0057038-Hughes1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, blood-retinal barrier, angiogenesis and immune response <xref rid="pone.0057038-ChanLing1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We combined the advantages offered by the whole-mount retina and developed a six marker immunohistochemistry protocol combined with confocal microscopy, spectral imaging, online emission fingerprinting and 3D image processing and analysis to visualise and quantify the total number of different Cxs and the size of gap junctional plaques. We also identified distinct heterogeneous gap junctional plaques comprised of more than one connexin protein with simultaneous visualisation of the astrocyte cytoskeleton and vasculature. Our findings lead us to suggest that retinal astrocytes display a level of plasticity in the expression of various Connexin proteins and that aging-associated changes in expression of Cxs and increased levels of heterogeneous gap junctional plaques, may play a compensatory role in GJIC and facilitate neuronal/astrocyte/vascular interactions. This modification or disruption of astrocyte GJIC during &#x02018;physiological&#x02019; aging therefore may underlie some of the age-related changes seen in neuropathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals and anaesthesia</title><p>We used forty-eight Wistar rats representing the following age groups; 3 month old - young adult (equivalent to 20 years of human life), 9 month old - middle age (equivalent to 40 years of human life) and 22 month old - aged (equivalent to greater than 80 years of human life) <xref rid="pone.0057038-Collier1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, as follows: For triple maker immunostaining of each of the different connexins i.e. Cx/GFAP/GS isolectin B4, we used 4 retinas from 4 different animals at each age (total 24 animals).

Titration series and conjugate experimental controls were performed on both primary and secondary antibodies to optimise for low background noise, maximal stain sensitivity, avoidance of non-specific staining and cross-reactivity. Each secondary was species- and class-specific to each primary. We then ran a series of experiments to determine the optimal use of secondary antibody conjugates. This allowed us to optimize the fluorophores' signaling without compromising the specificity and to ensure there was no emissions spectra overlap during our 6 marker immunohistochemistry. Based on results gathered from our control experiments it was clearly important to incubate Cx26 (goat polyclonal) primary antibody and its conjugate secondary antibody first, in order to circumvent any cross-reactivity with other antibodies that were raised in goat. In addition, GS isolectin B4 needed to be applied last to avoid further non-specific staining and cross-reactivity, as well potentially increased background to noise ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Connexin immunostaining in retinal astrocytes</title><p>After our extensive series of control experiments the following optimised protocol was adopted.

Z-stack images of immunolabelled astrocytes predominantly in the parenchyma and those predominantly associated with the vasculature in the retinal nerve fibre layer were acquired for analysis. In this study, as in our previous work <xref rid="pone.0057038-Mansour1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, we have assigned the astrocytes that are predominantly stellate, where the process field is almost circular and radiates from the soma, and only 1&#x02013;4 processes can be seen to touch a small capillary-sized blood vessel, as parenchymal. Where astrocytes processes were clearly seen to ensheath neighbouring blood vessels, we designated those as vascular-associated astrocytes. During imaging acquisition, the optimal interval (slice thickness) and pinhole size diameter were maintained at 8.2 &#x000b5;m and 136 &#x000b5;m respectively. The image frame size (512&#x000d7;512 pixels), scan speed (frame rate of 7) and averaging (2 scans per frame) also remained the same for all experiments. All parameters were standardised for best signal to noise ratio and adequate imaging efficacy. For six marker immunofluorescence experiments, images and spectral information were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope using lambda mode configuration. In each case, a lambda stack (32 images each displaying 10 nm bandwidth from 411&#x02013;754 nm) was collected; this records the spectral information for each pixel. In each case the spectral range, scan control settings [objective used (63&#x000d7;), pinhole size (136 &#x000b5;m), laser lines (405, 488, 561 and 633 nm), percentage laser transmission (7.1%), beam-splitter dichroic filter (HFT 405/488/561/633/KP 725)] were maintained the same. Reference spectra for each probe were created using regions of interest selected from the image and saved in a database (known as emission fingerprinting). Linear unmixing was performed in order to separate spectral information and the results were viewed and displayed. Linear unmixing separates the total emission signal in each pixel into weighted contributions of each dye based on the knowledge of their emission fingerprints. Six channel imaging was therefore carried out using the LSM 510 software in the online emission fingerprinting mode using the reference spectra in the database, in order to separate the different dye emissions.</p><p>All image data sets acquired with the Zeiss LSM 510 software (.lsm) were imported into Imaris software (Bitplane Inc, Saint Paul, MN) version 7.0. Utilizing the Imaris software we were able to visualise images in 3D and apply surface volume and object capability measurements of connexins based on shape, size and intensity. Snapshots of images were taken and saved as TIFF files. Imaris MeasurementPro, that allows the geometry and intensity measurement of objects to be measured, was used to quantify the number and plaque size of each connexin expressed by astrocytes. For each image, manual object segmentation was carried out using intensity thresholding for each colour channel, hence, each immunolabel as appropriate. Once objects of interest were clearly defined and distinguishable, a total number of objects per image and the size of objects were calculated. All object data (in voxels) were exported into an Excel spreadsheet.</p><p>The ImarisColoc module was used to obtain colocalisation information by identifying, visualising and quantifying colocalised regions. This latter module was used to generate a six multi-channel image of the connexins expressed by astrocytes. High-resolution images of connexin gap-junctions were processed to form three-dimensional projections via simulated fluorescence processing and orthogonal mode camera dialogue. For six-maker immunofluorescence Imaris-snapshot images, we used MATLAB complier runtime in Imaris XT function module, to set camera angle logarithmic functions and further determine measure angle, elevation and azimuth parameters. Additional imaging functions utilised included automated scale bar, object frame and clipping plane functions.</p><p>Our methodology did not permit us to distinguish between hemichannels of mixed Cx composition (i.e. heteromeric hemichannels) and heterotypic gap junction channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Determination of connexin numbers and plaque sizes</title><p>Images were captured using an inverted Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with Plan-Apochromat 63&#x000d7;/1.40 Oil DIC M27 objective and the excitation laser lines (405, 488, 561 and 633 nm).

We also confirmed an increase in Cx30 by measuring total protein levels.</p><p>As has been previously reported <xref rid="pone.0057038-Kerr1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057038-JanssenBienhold1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, we confirm that Cx43 was readily detectable in rat retinal tissues at all ages.

<xref rid="pone.0057038-Cotrina1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, who demonstrated that in mouse brain astrocytes, both Cx30 and Cx43 expression peaked at 7 months; Cx43 plaques remained elevated at 21 months while the number of Cx30 plaques dropped by half; and Cx30 and Cx43 protein expression remained constant during aging. Differences to our results could be due to regional and species differences since Cotrina et al., studied sections of mouse hippocampus, whilst we studied rat retinal wholemounts and differences in methodological approaches. Cotrina <italic>et al.</italic> utilised single immunohistochemistry on adjacent serial sections and we utilized six marker immunohistochemistry concurrent with advanced post-capture image analysis. Cotrina <italic>et al.</italic>'s method seriously limits the accuracy of GFAP and Cx co-localisation. Cotrina et al., also measured Cx levels in whole brain extracts rather than in hippocampus, which is where they measured their Cx expression. A further concern is their use of the Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) technique to evaluate functional gap junction coupling. CDCFDA, the dye used in the FRAP technique, is a non-fluorescent molecule that diffuses into cells and is hydrolyzed by intracellular non-specific esterases, yielding a membrane-impermeant fluorescent probe. The probe accumulates exclusively in cells with intact cell membranes. However, this probe labels all intact cells in the hippocampal slices and not exclusively astrocytes. Therefore Cotrina <italic>et al.</italic> can only claim that coupling between <italic>all</italic> cells present in the hippocampus, including neurons and oligodendrocytes, remains high not that astrocyte coupling remains high.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Heteromeric, Mixed-Homotypic and Heterotypic Interactions in Retina</title><p>While the most abundant combinations in the retina were homomeric-homotypic, we readily detected all possible combinations of connexin heterogeneity in gap junction plaques that may either form heteromeric, mixed-homotypic and heterotypic interactions in astrocytes in the rat retina. The Cx26/Cx45 combination was found to be abundantly expressed and significantly upregulated with age. A further four combinations of connexin proteins: Cx30/Cx45, Cx26/Cx30/Cx45, Cx30/Cx43/Cx45 and Cx26/Cx30/Cx43/Cx45 were also found to significantly increase with aging.

Another study also demonstrated that astrocyte Cx26 co-localises with Cx30 and Cx43 in the CNS <xref rid="pone.0057038-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Our observations, in combination with these previous studies, support the suggestion that Cx30 and Cx43 interact to form heteromeric connexons, and that these second class of astrocyte gap junction consists primarily of heteromeric, heterotypic intercellular channels. Our observations concur with previous findings that there is an unexpected complexity for gap junctions between astrocytes. The occurrence of these naturally occurring heteromeric, heterotypic intercellular channels could subserve unique function. However, significant additional functional studies are required to support this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Functional Significance of Heterotypic Gap Junctions</title><p>Bevans <italic>et al.</italic> 1998 <xref rid="pone.0057038-Bevans1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> demonstrated that heterotypic gap junctions could discriminate which second messenger molecules could pass through them and this was partially due to the pore diameter. There is also evidence that hetero-mixing of multiple Cxs in astrocytes may contribute to directionality of substances which pass through GJ's <xref rid="pone.0057038-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Astrocytes have an important role in potassium buffering during neuronal activity and it has been suggested GJs in astrocytes provide an intracellular pathway for the removal of potassium into available sinks such as capillaries. Evidence for this is that astrocyte Cx30 co-localizes with large inwardly rectifying potassium channels in adult brain <xref rid="pone.0057038-Kunzelmann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Whilst our confocal imaging suggests that various patterns of heterotypic and heteromeric appearance of glial connexins exist in the rat retina, further functional studies would provide additional support for this interpretation.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Connexin plaque size and conductance are related</title><p>We found that plaques that consisted of Cx30 were increased in size with aging. Whilst earlier reports <xref rid="pone.0057038-Nakajima1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057038-Tuttle1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> suggested that only 10% of gap junction channels are open, Nakajima's conductance measurements were compared with plaque size assuming 100 pS single channel conductance. We now know the unitary conductance of Cx36 (the mammalian orthologue of the fish Cx35) is about 15 pS, thus Nakajima's conclusion that only a small percent of connexons in gap junction plaques represent open intercellular channels is incorrect. Further, more recent studies by Bukauskas <xref rid="pone.0057038-Bukauskas1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> also found similar results, again comparing plaque size (using GFP tagged connexins) with conductance. Thus, there is currently no doubt that plaque size and conductance are related and that a higher immunosignal between cells can be interpreted as more communication between cells, though the exact relationship between plaque size and conductance remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>The Dynamic nature of connexin expression by astrocytes: Friend or foe in Aging and Disease?</title><p>Taken together with previous findings our results lead us to suggest a mechanism whereby astrocyte-neuronal-vascular interactions during aging results in an altered pattern of Cx expression as reported in this study.

Based on the above, our data leads us to conclude that astrocytes have the ability to dynamically regulate the expression of Cx to best subserve their functional roles in the aging CNS. Further work will be necessary to provide compelling evidence for this interpretation of our findings.</p><p>Changes in Cx expression in astrocytes have been reported in disease. Studies have shown that increased astrocyte Cx43 is associated with glaucoma <xref rid="pone.0057038-Hernandez1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and Huntington disease <xref rid="pone.0057038-Vis1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. It has also been demonstrated that Cx43 is altered in experimental diabetic retinopathy in rat retinal astrocytes <xref rid="pone.0057038-Bobbie1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and mutations in Cx43 lead to small eyes and often blindness in the syndrome oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) <xref rid="pone.0057038-Paznekas1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Ball <italic>et al.</italic> 2011 <xref rid="pone.0057038-Ball1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> also showed Cx30 to be reduced in diabetic rat brain astrocytes, however this was dependent on the region of the rat brain studied. As we have now demonstrated an increase in astrocyte Cx30 with aging, and several astrocyte Cx gap junction couplings all expressing Cx45, we suggest that these changes in astrocyte function during aging may underlie the pathology of various neurodegenerative conditions associated with aging including glaucoma.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Special thanks to Gavin Symonds from Carl Zeiss Australia for assistance with the creation of the spectral dye reference database and online emission fingerprinting.
