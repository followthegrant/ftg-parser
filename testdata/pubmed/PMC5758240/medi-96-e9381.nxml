It has been indicated that patients suffering from AD are vulnerable to abnormalies in behavioral and psychological symptoms, such as depression, irritability, agitation, aggression, and delusions during the overall course of the disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Accordingly, large numbers of prescriptions for antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs are dispensed to control the behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with AD. However, the overall benefits of these medications are still under debate, because these antipsychotic and antidepressants drugs have the potential to cause serious side effects, such as metabolic disorders and stroke related mortality.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> On the contrary, increasing evidence suggests that nonpharmacological treatment for dementia associated with AD and other diseases may be optimal for the relieving of the physical and psychological symptoms, and more importantly, do not have serious adverse effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Currently, various nonpharmacological treatments are used for the treatment of AD-related dementia, including behavioral intervention, music therapy, multisensory stimulation therapy, and reminiscence therapy,<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> of which, reminiscence therapy is suggested to be of great potential.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> According to the definition from the American Psychological Association, reminiscence therapy is defined as the use of life histories&#x02014;written, oral, or both to improve psychological well-being.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Since the first performance of reminiscence therapy in 1963 by Butler, reminiscence therapy has now been applied in patients with chronic conditions, depression, and dementia from Western countries, Japan, Taiwan, and other regions of the world.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Results of some pilot clinical trials have indicated the efficacy of reminiscence therapy for the improvement of cognitive function and overall quality of life, particularly the emotional function and overall happiness in these patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> However, in developing countries like China, reminiscence therapy is performed based on the judgment of the physician, and the evidence-based efficacy of reminiscence therapy in these patients remains to be determined. Therefore, we designed this randomized parallel-design controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of reminiscence therapy on the cognitive, emotional, behavioral and psychological symptoms, as well as daily living ability of patients with AD. Results of our study may provide primary scientific evidence for the using of reminiscence therapy in AD-related dementia in China.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Main objective</title><p>This study aims to assess the effects of reminiscence therapy on cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and psychological symptoms, daily living ability, and other aspects in patients with mild and moderate AD in addition to conventional drug treatment.</p></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Methods/design</title><sec><label>3.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>This randomized parallel-design controlled trial will be conducted in the Beijing Geriatric Hospital of China. A total of 90 patients with AD will be recruited and randomized into 2 groups: intervention and control group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;45 per group). Random number sequences will be generated by a statistician using SAS software, and sealed envelopes will be used for randomization. The statistician who randomly assigned the participants will not be responsible for the enrollment of subjects, and another independent statistician will be responsible for uncovering at the end of the trial. In the intervention group, along with conventional drug therapy, the patients will be subjected to reminiscence therapy for 35 to 45 minutes each time, and 2 times/wk for 12 consecutive weeks. The patients in the control group will undergo conventional drug therapy. The primary outcome will be changes in Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive section (ADAS-Cog) scores in patients from each group, and the secondary outcomes are the changes of Cornell scale for depression in dementia (CSDD), Neuropsychiatric Inventory score (NPI), and Barthel Index (BI) scores. Evaluation will be performed before treatment, at 4 and 12 weeks of treatment, and 12 weeks after treatment.</p></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Study participants</title><p>Patients with mild-to-moderate AD from Beijing Geriatric Hospital, China.</p></sec><sec><label>3.3</label><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients presenting with all of the following criteria will be considered for study inclusion.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Men and women aged 65 to 89 years.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Diagnosis of probable or possible AD based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>Mild to moderate stage of dementia based on the clinical dementia rating score between 1.0 and 2.0.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Informed consent provided by the patient and/or their legal guardian.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec><label>3.4</label><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients with any of the following conditions will be excluded from this study.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Diagnosis of cognitive impairment caused by vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson disease dementia, and other diseases except AD.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Severe hearing loss.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Serious communication barrier.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Comorbidities of acute infection, trauma, myocardial infarction, and other emergencies.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec><label>3.5</label><title>Withdrawal criteria</title><p>Patients who meet either of the following criteria will be withdrawn from this study.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Complications that affect efficacy judgments or onset of disease that may affect outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use of other therapies to increase the speed of recovery.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec><label>3.6</label><title>Recruitment</title><p>Outpatients and inpatients in the Dementia Unit will be recruited by dementia specialists.

The intervention group will be treated with reminiscence therapy in conjunction with conventional drug therapy the same as for the control group. For the intervention group, a grouped-based reminiscence treatment will be performed. Briefly, each 6 to 8 people from the treatment group form a subgroup, and with the guidance by a psychotherapist and 2 nurses, the group reminiscence treatment will be applied for 30 to 45 minutes per each time, 2 times/wk for 12 consecutive weeks. The specific operational procedures for the reminiscence therapy are the following: <italic>Memories trigger</italic> with a variety of tangible stimuli to trigger memories of patients with AD. Many of these tangible stimuli may be patient's albums, letters, and beloved items; family life supplies; drama; music; historical stories, and other stimuli, which will be obtained by the psychotherapists and nurses from the family members or insiders before the formal reminiscence treatment is started; <italic>Memories evoked</italic>, which also means memory extraction. Patients with AD usually have significant short-term memory impairment, whereas the long-term memory is relatively preserved, so memory extraction often point to patient pairment, whereas the long-term memory is relatively the formal reminiscence designed to gradually delve into the 12 reminiscence topics, which include diet and cooking, family relationship and early memory, old house, wedding, personal collection, working conditions and environment, songs and music, old movies, life for the first time, change and loss, celebrations, and wishes; <italic>Presentation of the memory</italic>&#x02014;elders suffering with AD show different narrative styles. Some patients will only repeat the same story fragments, whereas others talk about a wide range of life themes and make some comments. Other patients can only give a brief description of the self-story. Therefore, medical staff need to make all the patients, as much as possible, directly involved in the interview to make the contents of the patient's story integrated, which is the most basic part of reminiscence therapy; <italic>Memories of sharing</italic>&#x02014;repeat reading and discussion of the recalled story, to receive the benefits of reconstruction. Because AD patient's memories are often fragmented, the patient's memories will be digitally recorded, transcribed, edited, and modified so that these story fragments are reconstructed into a coordinated, coherent whole.</p></sec><sec><label>3.10</label><title>Evaluation of efficacy</title><p>The reminiscence therapy's efficacy will be evaluated by 2 attending physicians from the Dementia Unit using a specially developed assessment manual before treatment, at 4 and 12 weeks of treatment, and 12 weeks after treatment.</p></sec><sec><label>3.11</label><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>The primary outcome is defined as the difference in ADAS-Cog scores before treatment, at 4 and 12 weeks of treatment, and 12 weeks after treatment. The ADAS-Cog, developed by Rosen et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> is a scale to assess cognitive function of patients with mild to moderate AD, and examines multiple cognitive domains including memory, language, praxis, and orientation. The ADAS-Cog has been well applied in trials of symptomatic treatments for mild-to-moderate AD, and its reliability and detection effectiveness have been confirmed to be acceptable by many clinical studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Overall, it is widely used as an outcome measure in clinical trials that evaluate the cognitive changes of AD.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>3.12</label><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><sec><label>3.12.1</label><title>Cornell scale for depression in dementia</title><p>The CSDD, developed by Alexopoulos et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> is a valid tool for identifying depressive symptoms in patients with cognitive impairment, particularly with AD. Moreover, the validity of the CSDD has been successfully investigated and substantiated, including cross-culturally.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> The CSDD contains 19 questions, each of which can be given a score ranging from 0 (absent) to 2 (severe). The scale is divided into 5 subscales, including mood-related signs, behavioral disturbances, physical signs, cyclic functions, and ideational disturbance.</p></sec><sec><label>3.12.2</label><title>Neuropsychiatric Inventory</title><p>The NPI, developed by Cummings et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> is the most widely used rating scale for psychiatric and behavior symptoms in neurologically impaired patients. The NPI examines 10 subdomains of behavioral functioning, including delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability/lability, and aberrant motor activity. Each factor will be rated for severity (0&#x02013;3 points) and symptom frequency (0&#x02013;4 points). The scoring index will include factor scores (frequency&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;severity) for a total score (0&#x02013;144 points). Higher scores represent more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Firstly, reminiscence has been described as &#x0201c;the volitional or non-volitional act or process of recollecting memories of oneself in the past,&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> and is a process of recalling and re-experiencing one's life events. Moreover, this process itself will help the elderly to extract and repeat and thereby strengthening personal memories. Therefore, it is very suitable for the elderly with AD.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> Secondly, many studies reported that reminiscence therapy may help alleviate depressive symptoms in the elderly suffering from depression<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> or cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup> The elderly with AD often have depressive symptoms, and the overall incidence of behavioral and psychological symptoms is reported to be as high as 70% to 90% at specific stages of AD.<sup>[<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup> Therefore, reminiscence therapy has a positive effect not only on cognitive function, but also on emotional functions for the elderly with dementia.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, compared to conventional drug treatment, reminiscence treatment has no severe side effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup> Compared to other kinds of nonpharmacological therapy, such as cognitive therapy, reminiscence treatment is easy to perform by a therapist or nurse who has been trained.<sup>[<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>9.2</label><title>Innovation of this study</title><p>Firstly, most similar previously published studies were performed in dementia patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> However, dementia itself is a clinical syndrome, the causes of which includes AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontal temporal leaf disease, and other different pathogenesis of diseases. The different underlying background diseases in patients of dementia may be the important confounding factors that affect the overall therapeutic efficacy of certain treatments for dementia. For example, the characteristics of Lewy body&#x02013;related dementia is the existence of cognitive function fluctuations, regardless of treatment or not.<sup>[<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]</sup> Therefore, this study included patients with dementia with AD only, with the purpose of eliminating the pathological heterogeneity of dementia on the effect of intervention.</p><p>Second, most of the previous studies used the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scale for cognitive function evaluation as the primary indicator. However, some items of MMSE may not be sensitive for the evaluation of cognitive function in dementia patients with mild AD.<sup>[<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]</sup> Thus, in this study we used ADAS-Cog to evaluate cognitive function, which is more widely used as a standard tool in pivotal clinical trials to detect therapeutic efficacy in cognition.<sup>[<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</sup></p><p>Thirdly, in this study, CSDD, NPI, and BI are also used to evaluate the effects of reminiscence therapy on the mood, behavior, and psychiatric symptoms, as well as daily living ability of patients with AD. Because of the lack of relevant research reports in China, this study may be the first clinical trial of group reminiscence intervention for people with AD in China. Results of our study may provide additional information on the potential efficacy of reminiscence therapy on cognitive function in dementia patients with AD.</p></sec><sec><label>9.3</label><title>Evidence for contribution to future studies</title><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of reminiscence therapy on cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and psychological symptoms, and daily living ability of Chinese elderly patients with mild and moderate AD. Despite reminiscence therapy being widely used in Western countries, it is often used as an empirical application in China. The evidence-based efficacy of reminiscence therapy in patients with AD-related dementia remains to be determined. In addition, as the Chinese elderly are different from Western elderly in cultural background, values, and expression, it is necessary to verify the efficacy of reminiscence treatment in elderly Chinese patients with AD. The data and results will contribute to the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions in AD of elderly Chinese.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AD = Alzheimer disease, ADAS-Cog = Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive section, BI = Barthel Index, CSDD = Cornell scale for depression in dementia, MMSE= mini-mental state examination, NPI = Neuropsychiatric Inventory score.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>XM and ML designed the study.
