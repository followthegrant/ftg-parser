Herein, we challenged the hypothesis that ghrelin, a pleiotropic modulator, is potentially involved in IR-induced germ cell injury. Lower body exposure to 2&#x02009;Gy of IR induced a notable increase of ghrelin expression in the nuclear of differentiating spermatogonia at defined stages, with an impairment in the Leydig cells (LCs)-expressing ghrelin. Unexpectedly, inhibition of the ghrelin pathway by intraperitoneal injection of a specific GHS-R1<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> antagonist enhanced spermatogonia elimination by apoptosis during the early recovery following IR, and thereafter resulted in impaired male fertility, suggesting that the anti-apoptotic effects of evoked ghrelin, although transient along testicular IR injury, have a profound influence on the post-injury recovery. In addition, inhibition of ghrelin signaling resulted in a significant increase in the intratesticular testosterone (T) level at the end of 21&#x02009;days after IR, which should stimulate the spermatogenic recovery from surviving spermatogonia to a certain extent during the late stage. We further demonstrated that the upregulation and nuclear trafficking of ghrelin, elaborately regulated by IR-elicited antioxidant system in spermatogonia, may act through a p53-dependent mechanism. The elicitation of ghrelin expression by IR stress, the regulation of ghrelin expression by IR-induced oxidative stress and the interaction between p53 and ghrelin signaling during IR injury were confirmed in cultured spermatogonia. Hence, our results represent the first evidence in support of a radioprotective role of ghrelin in the differentiating spermatogonia. The acutely, delicate regulation of local-produced ghrelin appears to be a fine-tune mechanism modulating the balance between testicular homeostasis and early IR injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ionizing radiation</kwd><kwd>ghrelin</kwd><kwd>spermatogonia</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Spermatogenesis, a finely tuned process, is very sensitive to endogenous and exogenous stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Cancer therapies such as radiation often lead to a temporary disruption or a complete arrest of spermatogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> In major cases, detrimental effects of ionizing radiation (IR) on biological tissue are mediated via indirect interactions, which increased production of hydroxyl radicals (&#x02022;OH) by radiolysis of H<sub>2</sub>O, followed by the abnormal elevation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> The latter results in a cell cycle block, followed by apoptosis if the damage is severe.

Therefore, the present work attempted to explore the possible involvement of testicular ghrelin in the IR-induced testis injury.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of testicular ghrelin correlates to the increased apoptosis after IR injury</title><p>Testicular expression of ghrelin was first explored at the mRNA and protein levels. Initial quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses demonstrated a clear-cut elevation in <italic>ghrelin</italic> level in response to testicular IR treatment, with no difference being detected between two post-treatment time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This expression was confirmed at the translational level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In control mice, ghrelin immunoreactivity was mainly detected in the cytoplasm of LCs, which was substantially abolished by IR. Conversely, ghrelin immunoreactivity was predominantly localized in the nuclear in the outer layer of the seminiferous tubules after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). IR-induced ghrelin expression appeared to be restricted to spermatogonia as shown in higher magnification (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In particular, ghrelin first appeared at Stage II&#x02013;IV, maintained a stable level at Stage V&#x02013;VI, and reached the highest level at Stage VII&#x02013;VIII (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The subcellular localization of IR-induced ghrelin was further confirmed by immunoblotting analysis with cytoplasmic marker Gapdh and nuclear marker histone H1 in the extracts from isolated spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Because the killing of male GCs by radiation has previously been attributed to apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> (we also confirmed that increased apoptosis not aberrant cell proliferation contributes to the cell loss in irradiated testis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S3 a&#x02013;c</xref>)) and the apoptosis of the murine GCs after testicular IR reaches to the maximum level at about 16&#x02009;h (as assessed by the apoptotic index, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), we next determined whether the GCs expressing nuclear ghrelin were experiencing apoptosis using double immunofluorescence analysis at this time point. TUNEL-positive cells (empty arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), which have been confirmed to be spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3d</xref>), appeared in the outer layer of the seminiferous tubules at post-treatment 16&#x02009;h. In contrast, no apoptotic GCs were found positive for ghrelin immunostaining (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). These results are collectively indicative of a potential involvement of ghrelin in IR-induced testicular injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of ghrelin signaling enhances the IR-induced testicular mitotic damage</title><p>Subsequent analyses were directed toward the characterization of the role of endogenous ghrelin signaling in IR-induced GC injury. We treated mice with [D-Lys-3]-GHRP-6 (D-GHRP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), a specific GHS-R1<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> antagonist, which had been shown to effectively inhibit the effects of ghrelin within the body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> We first demonstrated that D-GHRP treatment alone exerted no apparent toxicity to the GCs development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). After D-GHRP treatment, very few GCs inside the seminiferous tubules were found positive for the nuclear staining at post-treatment 16&#x02009;h, suggesting that disruption of the interaction between ghrelin and its receptor can efficiently block the ghrelin translocation in response to IR insult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Subsequent quantitative TUNEL analyses revealed that inhibition of ghrelin signaling significantly enhances the IR-induced GCs apoptosis at post-treatment 16&#x02009;h, with no difference being detected at post-treatment 21&#x02009;days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2d&#x02013;f</xref>, the relative percentages of primary spermatocytes (4C) in vehicle and D-GHRP treated groups at Post-IR 16&#x02009;h were both significantly increased as compared with that in control mice treated with D-GHRP alone (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). In contrast, only a notable increase was observed in the relative percentages of spermatogonia (2C) in D-GHRP-treated groups at post-IR 16&#x02009;h. As for post-IR 21&#x02009;days, the relative percentages of 4C and spermatids (1C) were both significantly reduced in vehicle&#x0002b;IR or D-GHRP&#x0002b;IR-treated groups, with a significantly lower value of 1C being detected in D-GHRP&#x0002b;IR groups. The effect of D-GHRP treatment on IR-induced GCs loss was also morphologically confirmed in hematoxylin and eosin staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). These results indicated that the genetic damage induced by IR probably originates from spermatogonia, and may not be effectively repaired in the absence of ghrelin signaling and thereafter manifest itself in late stage of spermatogenesis. To further identify at which stage the differentiation of spermatogonia was blocked, we performed qRT-PCR analyses on testis RNA from D-GHRP or vehicle control-pretreated mice at post-IR 16&#x02009;h using specific primers for mouse <italic>Zbtb16</italic> and <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (undifferentiated spermatogonia), for mouse <italic>Kit</italic> and <italic>Sohlh2</italic> (differentiating spermatogonia) and for mouse <italic>Ldh-c4</italic> (preleptotene spermatocytes), respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> All cell markers tested proved to be constantly expressed at post-IR 16&#x02009;h, with the significant decreases only being detectable in the differentiating spermatogonia of D-GHRP-pretreated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). These data suggest that the protective effect of endogenous ghrelin against testicular IR insult mainly occurred in the differentiating spermatogonia. The available data made us wonder whether the surviving spermatozoa are capable of inseminating an egg, thereby retaining their reproductive competence. We carried out the mating experiments at the end of 45&#x02009;days after IR treatment because spermatogenesis is considered to be completely reconstituted around this time point after a low-dose irradiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Overall, the fertility potential was substantially restored in the vehicle control-pretreated mice. By contrast, inhibition of ghrelin signaling resulted in a dramatic decrease in the impregnation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). These results convincingly confirmed that activation of ghrelin signaling in spermatogonia is an indispensable defensive mechanism against testicular IR insult.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of ghrelin inhibition on spermatogenesis-related hormones after IR injury</title><p>Levels of hormones including T, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were assessed given their pivotal roles in the control of spermatogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Despite the reported inhibitory effect of the ghrelin signaling on testicular steroidogenesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> mice maintained LH, T and FSH concentration fairly constant along the first 16&#x02009;h after irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a&#x02013;d</xref>). By contrast, the level of intratesticular T remained significantly high at post-IR 21&#x02009;days in both groups, with the highest level being detected in the D-GHRP-treated groups at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Consistently, a significant decrease of the plasma LH could also be detected in both groups at post-treatment 21&#x02009;days, with the lower value observed in the D-GHRP-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Moreover, the plasma FSH levels in two experimental groups were both substantially elevated at post-IR 21&#x02009;days, with no difference being detectable between different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). These data suggest that ghrelin signaling may be involved in the serological change during the late recovery from testicular IR injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of ghrelin expression by testicular oxidative stress in response to IR injury</title><p>Testicular IR induced oxidative stress, which was characterized by the elevated generation of malondialdehyde (MDA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) and increased expression of antioxidants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4b and c</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> The supplementation of exogenous antioxidants (Vit C&#x0002b;Vit E) could significantly reduce IR-induced testicular oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a&#x02013;c</xref>). Interestingly, IR evoked a notable rise in ghrelin expression at post-IR 16&#x02009;h, whereas repeated administration of Vit C&#x0002b;Vit E prior to irradiation significantly compromised this upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Consistently, only a small fraction of nuclear-positive staining was observed in Vit C&#x0002b;Vit E-pretreated mice at post-IR 16&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). To determine whether oxidant system or antioxidant system regulates ghrelin expression during IR injury, we examined the ghrelin expression following low-dose irradiation (2&#x02009;Gy) or high-dose irradiation (5&#x02009;Gy). As increased intension of irradiation, the significant increased MDA concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6a</xref>), downregulation of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6b</xref>) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6c</xref>) at post-IR 16&#x02009;h implied severe damage in the testes. High-dose irradiation dramatically reduced the IR-elicited ghrelin expression in testes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6d</xref>). Consistently, the nuclear staining ghrelin frequently observed at specific stages following low-dose irradiation was barely detectable after high-dose irradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6e</xref>). To further define the specific antioxidant signaling, which may regulate ghrelin expression during IR, we treated mice with T-SOD inhibitor 10&#x02009;min before irradiation. Surprisingly, inhibition of T-SOD activity substantially abolished the IR-induced upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>) and nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>) of testicular ghrelin at post-IR 16&#x02009;h. The modulation of oxidative signaling on IR-induced ghrelin expression was further confirmed using immunoblotting analyses in spermatogonia nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Thus, T-SOD activation elicited by oxidative stress may act on the top of ghrelin signaling during the early recovery after IR stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Requirement of p53 transactivation in IR-induced ghrelin expression</title><p>P53-dependent apoptosis accounted for the bulk of the loss of the differentiating spermatogonia after IR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> In this context, we examined the association between endogenous ghrelin and p53 in testicular nuclear extracts at post-IR 16&#x02009;h. The interaction could be detectable only in the presence of IR stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Similarly, in cultured spermatogonia, IR stress elicited a notable interaction between p53 and ghrelin, which could be substantially compromised by the treatment with Vit C&#x0002b; Vit E, DEDT or D-GHRP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We then treated mice with a specific chemical inhibitor of p53 pathway prior to the IR treatment. As expected, a single intraperitoneally (i.p.) injection of PFT<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> 5 days prior to the IR experiments impaired activation of endogenous cellular p53-responsive genes, including <italic>cyclin G</italic>, <italic>p21/waf1/cip1</italic> and <italic>mdm2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7a</xref>), and consequently reduced the GC apoptosis at post-IR 16 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7b</xref>). Consistently, few spermatogonia in the PFT<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-treated testes were found positive for ghrelin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The inhibitory effect of PFT<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> on ghrelin nuclear translocation upon IR stress was confirmed using immunoblotting analyses in the extracts from isolated spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Moreover, inhibition of ghrelin signaling appeared to have no significant effect on IR-induced p53 pathway, as determined by qRT-PCR analyses using two p53-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). These results suggest that the translocation of testicular ghrelin may achieve via a p53-dependent mechanism.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, a single IR induced a dramatic increase in the ghrelin expression level at both time-points studied. However, upregulation of ghrelin expression was only positively correlated to the elevated apoptosis at post-IR 16&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), suggesting that the effect of ghrelin upregulation on GC injury mainly occurs during the very early phase after IR stress. In favor of this assumption, previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of exogenous ghrelin in the acute injury in other tissues. Intravenous injection of ghrelin could attenuate sepsis-induced acute lung injury and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Similarly, ghrelin exerts a hepatoprotective effect on carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> In this context, it is possible that enhanced production of endogenous ghrelin in irradiated testis may serve as a rapid response mechanism.</p><p>One distinguishing feature in our study is a dramatic decrease of ghrelin expression in LCs took place immediately after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This is understandable as the pathological conditions of irradiated testes are usually counter-conducive to LCs status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> However, impairment of ghrelin expression in LCs apparently did not cause much deleterious effects on LCs function during the early recovery, because a significant increase in the intratesticular T level can only be detectable at post-IR 21 days, with a higher value being observed in the D-GHRP-pretreated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This observation is in line with the previous report that LCs are more resistant to irradiation injury when compared to GCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> The relevance of this observation is two-fold: (1) it further documents the ability of ghrelin to negatively modulate testicular steroidogenesis; (2) it demonstrates for the first time that testis may use the upregulation of intratesticular T level, which may result from the downregulation of ghrelin expression, as a self-recovery promoting mechanism, as it has been shown that continuous treatment with T after IR markedly stimulated the recovery of spermatogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup></p><p>IR efficiently induces death of GCs, with the actively dividing spermatogonia being the most susceptible; doses as low as 0.1&#x02009;Gy are known to cause damage to these cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> In our experiments, ghrelin expression in spermatogonia was dramatically increased after IR treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c and d</xref>), suggesting a direct involvement of this molecule in local control of premeiotic homeostasis upon IR insult. Our localization result was not in agreement with the previously reported presence of ghrelin in rodent testis, in which ghrelin was found to express dominantly in LCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Three reasons may help to explain this expression discrepancy. (i) Expression of GHS-R1<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> has been demonstrated in the tubular compartment of the testis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> So theoretically, ghrelin may directly participate in the local regulation of GC function. (ii) Redistribution of proteins within the various cell compartments presents an important way of regulating the cellular responsiveness to stress conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> In this sense, trafficking of ghrelin following irradiation emphasizes its unique action as an intrinsic autocrine/paracrine modulator during IR injury. (iii) IR-induced specific ghrelin signals were exclusively observed in spermatogonia at defined stages of the seminiferous epithelial cycle (at stages II&#x02013;VIII). The physiological meaning of such a staged expression pattern awaits further investigation, although it is tempting to point out that these stages correlated well to the development of spermatogonia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Thus, ghrelin may exert certain effects on testicular mitosis in response to IR stress.</p><p>Further evidence for a functional role of elevated ghrelin expression is provided by its ability to elicit protective effect on differentiating spermatogonia in the presence of testicular IR. Inhibition of the interaction between ghrelin and its receptor using D-GHRP efficiently suppressed the nuclear translocation of ghrelin from post-irradiation 16&#x02009;h onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) but only selectively resulted in an upregulated apoptosis at post-irradiation 16&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), suggesting that the transient protective effect of ghrelin on GCs mainly occurs during the early recovery phase. Subsequent FACS analyses further confirmed that spermatogonia were the cell types most vulnerable to radiation-induced damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2d&#x02013;f</xref>), which points to a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the disruption of ghrelin signaling and IR-induced premeiotic damage. Specificity of the protective effects of ghrelin upon testicular IR stress is indirectly shown by the fact that inhibition of ghrelin signaling significantly enhanced the impairment of the expressions of two markers for differentiating spermatogonia, namely <italic>Kit</italic> and <italic>Sohlh2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), indicating that the differentiating spermatogonia are probably the main action sites of ghrelin during IR injury. Of note, at post-IR 45&#x02009;days, when spermatogenesis is supposed to be fully reconstituted, the impregnation rate of D-GHRP-treated mice was still much lower than that of vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). Thus, the protective effects of ghrelin, though transient along testicular IR injury, have a profound influence on the post-injury recovery of male fertility.</p><p>Testicular expression of ghrelin in response to IR appeared to be exquisitely regulated. First, expression levels of ghrelin were significantly downregulated immediately after antioxidant supplementation (Vit C&#x0002b;Vit E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d, e and h</xref>), which suggests that IR-induced ghrelin expression is tonically modulated (either positively or negatively) by oxidative stress. Indeed, deregulated ghrelin levels have been frequently associated with oxidative stress in different human pathologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Furthermore, the exogenous ghrelin can exert protective effects against oxidative stress under different pathological conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Our findings extend these understanding by identifying IR-elicited oxidative stress as a potent stimulus of testicular ghrelin expression. However, antioxidant system rather than oxidative damage <italic>per se</italic> appeared to play a more prominent role as the elicitor of testicular ghrelin during IR injury (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). This contention may also explain why IR-induced ghrelin expression only occurs during the very early phase of recovery, as the antioxidant system is usually compromised at a later stage of tubular damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> Concerning the enzymatic constituents of this defense system, SOD functions as the first and rate-limiting step of rapid conversion of superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>.) to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in order to prevent highly pernicious hydroxyl radicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> Recent studies reveal that SOD plays an important role against testicular oxidative damage in spermatogonia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> In our study, SOD appeared to be the specific antioxidant signaling modulating ghrelin expression during IR injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4f&#x02013;h</xref>). Our results also indicate that the protective effect of SOD system may execute via the regulation of local-produced ghrelin. From a general standpoint, it is intriguing to note that, although testicular oxidative stress is known to be detrimental to spermatogenesis in a number of pathological conditions, ghrelin action in spermatogonia appears to be a specific response to the IR insult (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Structurally, we did not find any nuclear localization signal (NLS) in ghrelin amino acid sequence. So, how did IR-elicited ghrelin translocate from the cytoplasm to the nuclear? One possibility is that ghrelin travels with the assistance of other trafficking regulators in the presence of IR stress. This is very common in other apoptosis regulators such as Rap1 and Ndrg2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Radiation-induced oxidative stress transiently upregulates p53 expression and induced nuclear translocation of p53 in actively dividing spermatogonia, where p53 functions as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of stress-response genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> Consistently, we showed that the nuclear interaction between endogenous ghrelin and p53 could only be detectable in irradiated testes and cultured spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5a and c</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibition of p53 signaling substantially abolished the IR-induced nuclear relocation of ghrelin in spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Regarding the directionality of IR-elicited p53 and ghrelin signaling, we reason that (i) IR-evoked ghrelin expression may require p53 as the functional assistance mechanism, similar as the requirement of p53 by ghrelin signaling in other pathogenesis;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> (ii) on the other hand, ghrelin may operate as a relatively independent signaling during testicular IR injury, because inhibition ghrelin by <italic>in vivo</italic> D-GHRP treatment had no effects on p53 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Additionally, p53 has been reported to be upregulated by oxidative stress, followed by the p53-dependent transcriptional induction of several target genes involved in the induction of apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> It is a logical hypothesis that apoptosis and nuclear translocation of ghrelin following radiation are both p53-dependent events.</p><p>In summary, we propose a model in which IR induces DNA damage within the differentiating spermatogonia, and in which p53, an intracellularly activated apoptotic protein, is stabilized by oxidative stress within GCs in response to the injury. This, in turn, leads to the activation of the antioxidant system, followed by a nuclear accumulation of ghrelin. The latter may serve as a mutual antagonist of p53 and help to maintain proper apoptotic balance in differentiating spermatogonia. On the other hand, the impairment of intratesticular environment by IR injury results in the downregulation of ghrelin expression in LCs and the subsequent increase in androgen production during the later phase, which may enhance the recovery of remaining GCs after testicular IR injury. Overall, the delicate regulation of local-produced ghrelin appears to be a fine-tune mechanism modulating the balance between testicular homeostasis and testicular IR injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and drugs</title><p>Wild-type C57BL/6 male mice were obtained from the Animal Research Center of Fourth Military Medical University and maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark in a 20&#x02013;25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C environment, with free access to standard pellet mouse chow and tap water.

The second time point (21 days) was selected because differentiation of mouse testicular GCs from early spermatogonia to spermatocytes and to spermatids lasts approximately 9 and 18 days, respectively. To this end, effects of IR on spermatogenesis could be reflected from the reduction in the 4C population of spermatocytes and the 1C population of spermatids at the 21st day after irradiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> In addition, testicular samples were taken at 16&#x02009;h after IR, and processed for immunohistochemical and double immunofluorescent analyses of ghrelin expression pattern, as described below.
