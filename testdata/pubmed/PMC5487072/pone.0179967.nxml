This process occurs in close proximity to the mitochondrial inner membrane. However, the mechanisms and molecular machinery involved in mitochondrial translation are not fully understood, and defects in this process can result in severe diseases. Stomatin-like protein (SLP)-2 is a mainly mitochondrial protein that forms cardiolipin- and prohibitin-enriched microdomains in the mitochondrial inner membrane that are important for the formation of respiratory supercomplexes and their function. Given this regulatory role of SLP-2 in processes closely associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane, we hypothesized that the function of SLP-2 would have an impact on mitochondrial translation. <sup>35</sup>S-Methionine/cysteine pulse labeling of resting or activated T cells from T cell-specific <italic>Slp-2</italic> knockout mice showed a significant impairment in the production of several mitochondrial DNA-encoded polypeptides following T cell activation, including Cytb, COXI, COXII, COXIII, and ATP6. Measurement of mitochondrial DNA stability and mitochondrial transcription revealed that this impairment was at the post-transcriptional level. Examination of mitochondrial ribosome assembly showed that SLP-2 migrated in sucrose-density gradients similarly to the large ribosomal subunit but that its deletion at the genetic level did not affect mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Functionally, the impairment in mitochondrial translation correlated with decreased interleukin-2 production in activated T cells. Altogether, these data show that SLP-2 acts as a general regulator of mitochondrial translation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6191-3733</contrib-id><name><surname>Madrenas</surname><given-names>Joaqu&#x000ed;n</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are essential for the function of most mammalian cells. These organelles are vital for a host of cellular processes and are typically the chief source of cellular energy production due to their ability to perform oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Though most genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are located in the nucleus, mitochondrial (mt) DNA encodes 37 genes of which 13 code for essential polypeptide subunits of respiratory chain complexes I, III, IV, and V, while the remaining two ribosomal (r) RNA and 22 transfer (t) RNA genes are necessary for mitochondrial translation [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179967.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Defects in the processes leading to expression of mitochondria-encoded polypeptides, including mtDNA maintenance, transcription, and translation, can result in improper assembly and function of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, a feature common to a heterogeneous set of severe, often fatal, mitochondrial diseases [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Mitochondrial genes are transcribed and translated in the matrix by processes involving unique molecular machinery that is separate and distinct from their nuclear and cytoplasmic counterparts. With regards to translation, mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) are made of components generated from both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The assembly of these components is hypothesized to occur in two mitochondrial subcompartments in two steps: early in nucleoids, which are centers of mtDNA maintenance, replication and transcription; and later in RNA granules, locations where post-transcriptional RNA processing and maturation occur [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179967.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, it is known that mitochondrial translation occurs in close proximity to the mitochondrial inner membrane [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179967.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Indeed, a biochemical study showed that nearly half of mammalian mitoribosomes interact with the mitochondrial inner membrane [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], suggesting that this process is mediated in part by mitoribosome interaction with integral or membrane-bound proteins.</p><p>Recent evidence in yeast mitochondria indicates that the mitoribosome binds to membrane-associated proteins [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and becomes anchored to the inner membrane during the translation of nascent polypeptides [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A similar process may occur during mammalian mitochondrial translation such that the 13 extremely hydrophobic core proteins of the respiratory chain are available for immediate membrane insertion during a coordinated process with nuclear-encoded proteins in which assembly of the respiratory chain complexes occurs. In this context, the local microenvironment of the mitochondrial inner membrane including its lipid and protein composition may be critical for the regulation of this process.</p><p>We have previously shown that stomatin-like protein (SLP)-2, a mainly mitochondrial protein of the SPFH family of proteins, binds to cardiolipin and functions to form specialized membrane microdomains involving cardiolipin and prohibitins in the mitochondrial inner membrane that are important for the activities of certain respiratory chain complexes [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179967.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and the formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Given this regulatory role of SLP-2, it is possible that its function may regulate other processes that depend on compartmentalization of the mitochondrial inner membrane, including translation. Here, we show that SLP-2 is required for <italic>de novo</italic> mitochondrial protein synthesis upon T cell activation in mice, and that this function is not mediated at the level of mtDNA stability or mitochondrial transcription. Furthermore, we show that SLP-2 migrates in sucrose-density gradients similarly to mitoribosome complexes but that its deletion at the genetic level does not alter mitoribosome assembly. Finally, the impairment in mitochondrial translation correlates with decreased T cell activation. These data identify SLP-2 as a key regulator of mitochondrial translation during T cell activation, a function that may extend to other tissues or cell-types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>De novo synthesis of mitochondria-encoded polypeptides is dependent on SLP-2 in activated T cells</title><p>To investigate whether SLP-2 functions to directly or indirectly regulate mitochondrial translation, we measured <italic>de novo</italic> mitochondrial protein synthesis in resting or stimulated T cells from wild type (WT) or T cell-specific <italic>Slp-2</italic> knockout (SLP-2 T-KO) mice by detection of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine/cysteine incorporation into nascent mitochondrial polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179967.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

To narrow down these possibilities, we first assessed mtDNA stability by measuring its abundance in WT or SLP-2-deficient T cells under resting conditions or during T cell activation by quantitative PCR.

To determine whether the disparity in mitochondrial translation between activated WT and SLP-2 T-KO T cells was due to impaired mitochondrial biogenesis in SLP-2-deficient T cells, we measured the gene and protein expression of PGC-1&#x003b1; under resting conditions and upon T cell activation.

SLP-2 and PHB1 protein levels were also substantially increased following T cell activation, corroborating previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, SLP-2 deficiency did not affect PGC-1&#x003b1; abundance at the gene or protein levels, indicating that mitochondrial biogenesis was not a contributing factor to the defective mitochondrial translation observed in SLP-2-deficient T cells upon activation.</p><p>Since there were no apparent defects in mtDNA stability or PGC-1&#x003b1; expression in resting or activated SLP-2-deficient T cells, we next examined whether mitochondrial transcription was occurring normally under these conditions. To test this, we performed quantitative reverse-transcriptase (qRT)-PCR to measure transcript levels of the genes corresponding to four of the most significantly decreased polypeptides, ND2, CYTB, COX2, and ATP6, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179967.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Additionally, it should be noted that one gene from each respiratory chain complex is represented in this selection.

Mammalian mitoribosomes are composed of a 28S small and 39S large subunit to form a 55S monosome [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The small subunit is composed of 12S rRNA and approximately 30 mitoribosomal proteins (MRPs), whereas the large subunit is composed of 16S rRNA and approximately 53 MRPs [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To assess mitoribosome assembly in the absence of SLP-2, we separated mitochondrial lysates of resting or stimulated WT or SLP-2 T-KO T cells based on size by sucrose density sedimentation, then collected and resolved 14 equal fractions by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots of protein components of the small (e.g., MRPS15, MRPS22) or large (e.g., MRPL14, MRPL44) mitoribosomal subunits revealed that under resting conditions, the amounts of the small and large mitoribosomal subunits, as well as amounts of fully assembled monosomes were not different in SLP-2-deficient T cells compared to WT T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179967.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

Interestingly, although some SLP-2 remained in less dense fractions at the top of the gradient, this protein mainly sedimented across fractions that contained mitoribosomal subunits in both resting and stimulated conditions. In fact, upon stimulation the sedimentation profile of SLP-2 shifted into denser fractions and was more abundant in those containing 55S monosomes compared to resting cells. The overlap in these sedimentation profiles indicates that we cannot exclude the possibility of a direct or indirect interaction between mitoribosomes and SLP-2. Immunoblotting of PHB2 revealed that its sedimentation profile did not match that of the mitoribosomes indicating that they are not directly associated. Altogether, these data document an important post-transcriptional function for SLP-2 in the production of mitochondria-encoded polypeptides.</p><fig id="pone.0179967.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0179967.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>SLP-2 migrates in sucrose-density gradients similarly to mitoribosome complexes but does not affect mitoribosome assembly.</title><p>Mitochondrial lysates from (A) resting or (B) anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated WT or SLP-2 T-KO T cells were layered onto 10&#x02013;30% discontinuous sucrose gradients.

Our findings identify SLP-2 as a vital protein for efficient mitochondrial translation during the metabolically demanding conditions accompanying T cell activation. Indeed, our data indicate that SLP-2 is important as a general regulator of mitochondrial translation since the expression of multiple polypeptides, namely Cytb, COXI, COXII, COXIII, and ATP6, is significantly affected by its absence. This defect in mitochondrial translation correlates with a functional impairment in T cell activation. Though the mechanism underlying this function of SLP-2 remains uncertain, the data presented here narrow the focus to a post-transcriptional role.</p><p>Deletion of <italic>Slp-2</italic> did not affect mitoribosome assembly, although we found that SLP-2 migrated in sucrose-density gradients similarly to the large mitoribosomal subunit and to a lesser extent the assembled monosome. This finding is corroborated by a study showing SLP-2 co-migration with the 39S mitoribosome complex by complexome profiling [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. More importantly, compared to resting conditions our data showed that SLP-2 migration increased in fractions containing the monosome during T cell activation, correlating with impaired translation efficiency of mitochondria-encoded polypeptides in SLP-2-deficient cells. Furthermore, deletion of <italic>Slp-2</italic> did not affect mitoribosome abundance. These findings indicate that SLP-2 is either directly or indirectly involved in the function of the mitoribosome and affects its efficiency, but by itself it is not essential for its assembly since the mitoribosome migration profiles were unchanged upon <italic>Slp-2</italic> deletion.</p><p>Mitochondrial translation is closely associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane, but its functional role in this process is poorly understood. Since SLP-2 forms specialized prohibitin- and cardiolipin-enriched microdomains in the mitochondrial inner membrane that are associated with the activities of certain respiratory complexes and the formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes, it is likely that SLP-2 may regulate mitochondrial translation by controlling the membrane composition at sites where translation occurs. We examined the migration profile of PHB2 with respect to mitoribosome complexes and found that its sedimentation profile on the sucrose gradient did not match that of mitoribosomes. However, a small amount of PHB2 was present in the same fractions as the small mitoribosomal subunit, in agreement with previous studies reporting that prohibitins contributed to mitochondrial translation [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and co-migrated with the 28S subunit [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Taken together, the sucrose gradient sedimentation pattern suggests a weak or indirect association of prohibitins with the mitoribosome. Interestingly however, though the absence of SLP-2 impaired mitochondrial translation in activated T cells, both mitoribosome assembly and the migration of PHB2 were unchanged relative to activated WT T cells. This implies that SLP-2 is not by itself responsible for monosome assembly or the potential association of prohibitins with the mitoribosome.</p><p>Finally, we found that although T cells lacking SLP-2 were able to produce each mitochondria-encoded polypeptide, efficient mitochondrial translation was dependent on SLP-2 only following T cell activation. Initially this seemed counter-intuitive since OXPHOS is the predominant form of energy production in resting T cells and is supplanted by aerobic glycolysis following T cell activation [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, not only is OXPHOS still engaged in activated T cells [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], it is significantly increased [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and is required for the expression of early activation markers and for optimal T cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179967.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that resting T cells lacking SLP-2 had the opportunity to produce sufficient amounts of mitochondria-encoded polypeptides since they were in a steady state with relatively low metabolic demands. However, activated T cells undergo rapid growth and become metabolically very active to support their proliferation and to exert their immune function [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We see this reflected in the significantly increased abundance of each mitochondria-encoded polypeptide in WT T cells during the transition from resting to activated states. However, SLP-2-deficient T cells did not have the capacity to increase mitochondrial translation, highlighting the importance of this protein. Furthermore, this impairment in mitochondrial translation may be a contributing factor to the defective functional responses of SLP-2-deficient T cells observed here and previously, which include decreased IL-2 production and delayed proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0179967.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we have identified SLP-2 as a key protein for general mitochondrial translation in activated T cells. Although the mechanism behind this function requires further study, we have shown that SLP-2 migrates in sucrose-density gradients similarly to mitoribosome complexes and hypothesize that it may exert its effect through the compartmentalization of the mitochondrial inner membrane at sites where translation occurs. Finally, we propose that this function may extend to other tissues or cell types, particularly those with great metabolic demands.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><p><italic>Mice</italic>.
