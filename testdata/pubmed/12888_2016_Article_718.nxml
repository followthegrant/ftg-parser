It causes significant dysfunction in multi-dimensions of personal function of the patients, with a wide range of clinical symptoms. In general, the symptoms of schizophrenia can be classified as positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, patients with schizophrenia also often have comorbid mood symptoms, either in the form of a manic mood or depression. Furthermore, risk factors associated with schizophrenia such as violence and suicide have been found to be correlated with the specific symptoms of schizophrenia. Among them, the risk of violence has been reported to be correlated with positive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and the risk of suicide has been reported to be correlated with negative symptoms and mood symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Music therapy has been used in the treatment of schizophrenia for decades, and it is often used as adjunct therapy to medication. It can take the format of individual therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], large group therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], or a combination of individual and group therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] through either &#x0201c;passive listening&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or &#x0201c;active participation&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Every form of music therapy has an effect in schizophrenic patients to a certain extent. However, most studies investigating the treatment effect of music therapy have focused on the effect on negative and mood symptoms only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Recently, there is one huge review article discussing the clinical application of music therapy in different disease entity, including neoplasm, disease of central nervous system, psychiatric illness, and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this article, the authors reviewed the evidences of music therapy in the schizophrenic patients mainly according to one recent meta-analysis conducted by the M&#x000f6;ssler and the colleagues (2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this meta-analysis conducted by M&#x000f6;ssler and the colleagues, the authors suggested that the application of music therapy in schizophrenic patients would be beneficial with regards to negative symptoms and mood symptoms. On the other hand, because of a lack of evidence, the role of music therapy in the treatment of positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients is inconclusive. However, positive symptoms have been proven to be highly associated with the risk of violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which contributes to the stigmatization of patients with schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the report by M&#x000f6;ssler et al. (2011) did not provide further information about the association between the treatment effect of music therapy and the specific characteristics of music therapy applied in schizophrenic patients.</p><p>In order to explore (1) the treatment effect of music therapy in patients with schizophrenia, and (2) the role of specific characteristics of music therapy in the treatment effect, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the treatment effect of music therapy on the specific subscale symptoms of schizophrenia, including the overall disease severity of schizophrenia, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general psychopathology, and mood symptoms. We performed meta-regression analysis to evaluate the association between the treatment effect of music therapy and the clinical variables or specific characteristics of music therapy, including frequency, duration of each session, total number of sessions of music therapy, and total duration of music therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Database schema and implementation</title><p>A systematic literature search was conducted by two independent psychiatrists (Wang, H.Y. and Tu, K.Y.) through PubMed. If there was an inconsistent selection and lack of agreement, a final decision was made by consensus. The search was performed using the key words &#x0201c;(music therapy) AND (schizophrenia)&#x0201d; for all articles written in English available unto September 10th, 2015. Initially, all of the search results meeting the inclusion criteria were collected, and the titles and abstracts were screened by Wang, H.Y. and Tu, K.Y. When there was disagreement on eligibility, we reached agreement through consensus. In current study protocol, the definition of music therapy had two forms of definition; the wide definition was that all the music applied in the treatment of patients, and the narrow one was that the music therapy should be arranged under specific settings, for example, group therapy, individual therapy, active participation, or directed by a specialists. All studies that were not related to music therapy in schizophrenic patients were excluded. Using the following inclusion criteria, we thoroughly screened the studies: (1) articles discussing comparisons of the treatment effect in patients with schizophrenia treated with music therapy and those with/without placebo; (2) articles on clinical trials in humans; and (3) case-controlled trials, either randomized or non-randomized. The exclusion criteria were (1) case reports or series; and (2) non-clinical trials. The screening and search protocol is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. We used Jadad scores to investigate the quality of the clinical trials included in this meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the selection strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria for the current meta-analysis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2016_718_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data extraction</title><p>The primary outcome was disease severity rating scale, which varied in every study and included the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scales (BPRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] , the Positive And Negative Symptoms Scales (PANSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and the Self-rating Depression Scales (SDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. All of the primary outcomes and other clinical variables were extracted from all of the studies included in the current meta-analysis. When data were not available, we tried to contact the authors to acquire the original data. Among the rating scales, we gave priority to the PANSS rather than the BPRS, SANS, and SDS, because it is more specific to the setting of schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Meta-analytic methods and quality of control</title><p>All of the effect sizes (ESs), which indicated changes in disease severity rating scales in the included studies, were set as the standardized mean difference based on Hedges&#x02019; adjusted <italic>g</italic>. We defined an ES greater than 0 as indicating &#x0201c;greater improvements in the primary outcome in schizophrenic patients who received music therapy than in patients treated with/without a placebo&#x0201d;. We tried to derive the ESs from other statistical parameters such as the <italic>t</italic> or <italic>p</italic> value with the sample size when the disease severity rating scales or the original data from the authors were unavailable. All of the ESs were synthesized using a random effects model for every meta-analysis.</p><p>All of the meta-analytic procedures were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). We considered the analysis to be statistically significant when a two-tailed <italic>p</italic> value was &#x0003c;0.05. We used Q statistics, their related p-value, and the <italic>I</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> statistic to investigate the heterogeneity of each study. We investigated publication bias through funnel plots, and Egger&#x02019;s regression analysis was used to test statistically for the significance of any possible publication bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We also performed subgroup meta-analysis or meta-regression analysis using the unrestricted maximum likelihood method to examine possible sources of heterogeneity and to investigate the possible confounding effects of clinical variables such as age, gender, duration of illness, number of previous hospitalizations, chlorpromazine equivalence, frequency of music therapy, total duration of music therapy, total number of sessions of music therapy, duration of each session of music therapy, disease severity, and &#x0201c;whole duration of illness&#x0201d;. We defined whole duration of illness as the period from the onset of psychosis to the time when the patients entered the study. Furthermore, we performed subgroup meta-analysis of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general psychopathology, and mood symptoms for the treatment effect of music therapy. In addition, to investigate whether or not the study design contributed to a different treatment effect, we performed subgroup meta-analysis to evaluate the treatment effect of music therapy in trials with randomized control trials (RCTs) or non-randomized control trials (non-RCTs). Besides, we also perform subgroup meta-analysis to investigate the possible confounding effect of different strategy of music therapy on the treatment effect. These meta-analytic procedures fulfilled the criteria of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. About the ethics of current study, it was not necessary for the ethical approval because that we would not deal with the patients&#x02019; detailed data. Furthermore, it was impossible for us to contact all the patients for the informed consent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Studies included in each meta-analysis</title><p>After screening, a total of 12 articles remained for meta-analysis (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. One of these studies used the SDS only which is less specific to the disease severity of schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and thus we included this study in the meta-analysis of the treatment effect of music therapy on the mood symptoms of schizophrenic patients only. The quality of the clinical trials was rated with an average Jadad score of 1.58 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of characteristics of studies in current meta-analysis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Study</th><th>Diagnostic criteria</th><th>Diagnosis</th><th>Comparison</th><th>N</th><th>Dropout rate</th><th>Mean age (years)</th><th>Gender (%female)</th><th>Chlorpromazine equivalence (mg/day)</th><th>Severity</th><th>Primary outcome</th><th>Subscale</th><th>Trials</th><th>Country</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gold, C.

In recent years, several new trials and studies have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Among them, most studies discussed the significantly better treatment effect of adjunct music therapy on the positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The significantly better treatment effect in newer published studies rather than previous reports might be derived from the different intervention design (group therapy versus individual therapy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], different frequency of music therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], or different total duration of music therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thus, it is necessary to conduct a further meta-analysis based on these newer evidences. The clinical implication that adjunct music therapy can alleviate positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients more effectively than in those who do not receive adjunct music therapy is important, in particular because positive symptoms are thought to be highly associated with the risk of violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, Courtright P and the colleague (1990) reported that the use of music therapy could help in reducing aggressive behavior in schizophrenic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Among the positive symptoms, the hallucination and delusion had been thought to be more prominent in clinical practice. Furthermore, the relationship between the auditory hallucination and music therapy was also one of the interesting topics about the treatment effect of adjunct music therapy in schizophrenic patients. However, we could not perform such meta-analysis of these topics because of the limited reports providing these data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Among these articles, there was only one discussing the differences of severity of hallucination or delusion after treatment of adjunct music therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and only one comparing the changes of severity of hallucination or delusion between experiment group (patients with adjunct music therapy) and control group (patients with standard treatment only) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. When we investigated the results of these two studies, we found significantly lower severity of hallucination and delusion after treatment of adjunct music therapy and significantly better improvement in hallucination in patients with adjunct music therapy than those with standard treatment only but not in delusion.</p><p>We also performed meta-regression analysis to evaluate the possible confounding effect of clinical variables. The results showed that the treatment effect of music therapy was positively associated with the &#x0201c;whole duration of illness&#x0201d;. This means that the application of music therapy for schizophrenic patients could alleviate disease severity, especially in those with chronic illness. Several authors have investigated the effect of music therapy on cognitive function in patients with chronic schizophrenia, and reported significant benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, the usage of specific music therapy has been reported to improve attention and motor performance in chronic schizophrenic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Taken together, supplemental music therapy can provide significant benefits for schizophrenic patients with a chronic course with regards to disease severity and also cognitive function.</p><p>In this study, we found a significantly inverse association between the treatment effect of music therapy and the number of previous hospitalizations. This seems to be in contrast to our other finding of a positive association between the treatment effect of music therapy and the whole duration of illness. A possible explanation may be the specific characteristics of the patients with more previous hospitalizations. In previous reports, schizophrenic patients with more previous hospitalizations have been reported to have worse treatment adherence, poorer treatment attitude, easier relapse, and poor support systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, the adherence or attendance rate to music therapy in schizophrenic patients with more previous hospitalizations may be poorer than those with fewer previous hospitalizations. However, we could not investigate the association between adherence/attendance rate and the treatment effect of music therapy because of a lack of data.</p><p>With regards to safety profile, the dropout rate was not significantly different between the schizophrenic patients who did and not receive adjunct music therapy. In addition, when we investigated the included studies individually, no severe adverse effect profile was reported with the use of music therapy.</p><p>With regards to the cost-effectiveness of music therapy in the treatment of schizophrenic patients, we found no significant associations between the treatment effect of music therapy and the frequency of music therapy, the total duration of music therapy, and the duration of each session of music therapy in meta-regression analysis. Furthermore, we investigated whether there was any difference in the treatment effect of adjunct music therapy in subgroup analysis by different frequency of music therapy or different total duration of music therapy. The results showed that the treatment effect was significantly better compared to those who did not receive adjunct music therapy, both in a total duration of music therapy shorter than 3&#x000a0;months and 3&#x000a0;months or longer, and a frequency of less than 4 times per week and 4 times a week or more. This indicates that adjunct music therapy in schizophrenic patients can result in a better treatment effect compared to those who do not receive adjunct music therapy when introduced into a treatment program regardless of the total duration, frequency, or duration of each session of music therapy. Because music therapy is costly and complex, clinicians may be reluctant to include it in clinical practice. However, our findings show that the effect of music therapy is beneficial regardless of the frequency, length, and duration. Therefore, we suggest that clinicians should consider including adjunct music therapy into their clinical practice to provide their patients with the best outcomes possible.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Limitation</title><p>There are some limitations to the current meta-analysis. First, most of the included studies conducted adjunct music therapy as a combination of passive listening and active participation and most of them were performed in forms of group therapy. This may lead to the problem that, for most of the studies that involved playing music, the therapy group would likely consist of patients who knew how to play an instrument. However, in the real world, this situation is unlikely to occur. Further studies are needed to investigate whether &#x0201c;passive listening&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;individual therapy&#x0201d; can provide benefits for schizophrenic patients, either in disease severity or with other symptoms. Second, as mentioned in the Discussion, we could not further analyze the association between the treatment effect of music therapy and the attendance rate of music therapy because of a lack of data. However, the attendance rate may be a confounding effect on the treatment effect of music therapy. Third, in order to perform the meta-analysis for the treatment effect of music therapy on the general aspect of disease severity, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general psychopathology, and mood symptoms, we pooled different studies with different rating scales including the PANSS, BPRS, SANS, and SDS. This may have increased the heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, which achieved significance. However, in previous reports, disease severity was shown to be associated between different rating scales to some degree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, there were no absolute contraindications to pool these different rating scales together. Therefore, in order thoroughly meta-analyze the subscales of specific symptoms, we chose to pool those rating scales together. Besides, in current study, we could not perform detailed meta-analysis of treatment effect of adjunct music therapy for the specific symptoms, such as hallucination or delusion, because of the limited reports providing such information. Finally, we tried to investigate the treatment effect of music therapy on schizophrenic patients with different disease severity. However, we could only perform the meta-analysis on those with mild disease severity but not those with moderate or severe disease severity because of a lack of sufficient trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our meta-analysis provides strong evidence to prove the role of adjunct music therapy in the treatment of schizophrenic patients. In these patients, adjunct music therapy improved the effect of treatment in negative and mood symptoms, and also positive symptoms compared to those who did not receive music therapy regardless of the total duration, frequency, total number of sessions, or the duration of each session of music therapy. The effect of treatment was especially pronounced for those with a chronic disease course. However, in order to extensively apply adjunct music therapy in a clinical setting, further trials are needed to evaluate the treatment effect of music therapy with &#x0201c;passive listening,&#x0201d; the possible confounding effect of attendance rate, and the treatment effect of music therapy on those with moderate or severe disease severity.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Availability and requirements</title><p>The database used in current meta-analysis is PubMed, which website is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed</ext-link>.
