We now report that extracellular histones released in response to inflammatory challenge contribute to endothelial dysfunction, organ failure and death during sepsis. They can be targeted pharmacologically by antibody to histone or by activated protein C (APC). Antibody to histone reduced the mortality of mice in lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or cecal ligation and puncture models of sepsis. Extracellular histones are cytotoxic toward endothelium <italic>in vitro</italic> and are lethal in mice. <italic>In vivo</italic>, histone administration resulted in neutrophil margination, vacuolated endothelium, intra&#x02013;alveolar hemorrhage and macro and microvascular thrombosis. Histone was detected in the circulation of baboons challenged with <italic>E. coli</italic> and the increase in histone levels accompanied the onset of renal dysfunction. APC cleaves histones and reduces their cytotoxicity. Co&#x02013;infusion of APC with <italic>E. coli</italic> in baboons or histones in mice prevented lethality. Blockade of protein C activation exacerbated sublethal LPS challenge into lethality which was reversed by antibody to histone. We conclude that extracellular histones are potential molecular targets for therapeutics for sepsis and other inflammatory diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Macrophage activation leads to production of several mediators including TNF and high mobility group box&#x02013;1 protein (HMGB1) that contribute to the severity of sepsis<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Recombinant human APC is approved by the FDA for the treatment of severe sepsis probably due to its anti&#x02013;inflammatory and cytoprotective functions rather than its anticoagulant activity <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. To explore other physiological mediators involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis we cultured LPS and interferon gamma activated mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells either in the presence or absence of recombinant human APC under the hypothesis that APC might proteolytically degrade an important mediator. The cytotoxicity toward endothelium was then compared between the two conditioned media. The medium from LPS and interferon gamma activated macrophages was toxic to the human endothelial cell line, EA.hy926, as measured by propidium iodide (PI) staining. APC reduced this cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig.1a</xref>). Comparing these media by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, three new bands of 10 kDa, 13 kDa and 15 kDa appeared in the presence of APC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig.1b</xref>). Sequencing identified the 10 kDa band protein as the mouse histone H4 (H4) internal sequence methyl&#x02013;Lys20&#x02013;Ile34.The 13 kDa protein matches the mouse histone H3 (H3) internal sequence Lys27&#x02013;Lys36. The N terminal sequence of the 15 kDa band protein could not be determined by direct Edman sequencing. Following in gel tryptic digestion, MS/MS identified three peptide sequences that match the mouse histone H2A protein sequences Ala21&#x02013;Arg29, His82&#x02013;Arg88 and Val100&#x02013;Lys118. These data suggested that extracellular histones are cytotoxic toward endothelium and that APC is cytoprotective by cleaving them. The H3 identification was confirmed by Western blotting using antibody to H3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig.1c</xref>). The apparent increase in histone fragments present in the conditioned medium of activated macrophages cultured with APC might indicate that APC could not only cleave the soluble extracellular histones in the medium but also the histones associated with the activated cells or DNA.</p><p id="P3">To determine if histones are toxic to endothelium and whether APC can reduce the histone cytotoxicity, we treated EA.hy926 with a mixture of histones or five individual histones. We found that a mixture of histones was cytotoxic to these cells and this toxicity was mainly due to histones H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Inclusion of APC reduced this cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1b</xref>). Histones have similar or greater cytotoxicity toward primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC) and APC also reduces this cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). When incubated with endothelium, H4 elicited calcium transients which were blocked by an antibody to H4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P4">To test whether APC could cleave histones in a purified system, we incubated the purified H3 or H4 with APC. These histones were cleaved in a dose dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref>). Liposomes containing phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) enhanced histone cleavage by APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1d</xref>), similar to the effect of PE on APC inactivation of coagulation factor Va<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. This lipid mixture is presumably a mimic of a cell surface membrane after injury or exposure to a potent agonist.</p><p id="P5">Histone cytotoxicity is concentration dependent <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a</xref>). 10 nM and 100 nM APC reduced the cytotoxicity at low histone concentration (25 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) but only 100 nM APC effectively reduced the cytotoxicity of histones at 50 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2a</xref>). Pre&#x02013;incubation of histones (50 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and APC (100 nM) for 5 min reduced cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b</xref>). This cytoprotective effect of APC against histones is mediated by cleavage of histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2c</xref>) and not by APC mediated PAR1 signaling, a known alternative cytoprotective function of APC<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, since APC was inactivated by PPACK after pre&#x02013;incubation with the histones to prevent the APC mediated activation of PAR1. Protein C is converted to APC by the thrombomodulin&#x02013;thrombin complex on endothelium. Endothelial cells were not protected with either protein C or thrombin from histone cytotoxicity, but were protected when both protein C and thrombin were present. Fully activated protein C provided the best protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2d</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To test whether extracellular histones may be involved in the pathogenesis of diseases and if APC can cleave these histones <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined frozen archival plasma samples from a non&#x02013;human primate model of sepsis in which baboons were challenged with a lethal dose of <italic>E. coli</italic>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Infusion of APC rescued these animals<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. We measured extracellular histones in the plasma from animals challenged with the lethal dose of <italic>E. coli</italic> either in the absence or presence of infused APC. Intact H3 was detected by Western blot in the plasma of two baboons challenged which reached ~15 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> eight hours post&#x02013;challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2e</xref>). We were unable to measure other histones by this method because those antibodies were not adequately sensitive. The increase in H3 accompanied the onset of acute renal failure as indicated by a high serum creatinine level, 2.65 &#x000b1; 0.05 mg dL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (normal range: 0.7 &#x02013;1.4 mg dL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) eight hours post&#x02013;challenge. Both intact and cleaved H3 were observed in the plasma of two animals challenged with a lethal dose of <italic>E. coli</italic> and administered APC, indicating that APC can cleave extracellular histones <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2e</xref>). APC co&#x02013;infusion protected renal function as indicated by the normal serum creatinine level, 1.15 &#x000b1;0.15 mg dL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at eight hours post&#x02013;challenge. We also found high levels of extracellular histones in frozen archival plasma samples from some septic patients consistent with the presence of nucleosomes<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In at least one patient treated with APC, significant cleavage of H3 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2f</xref>). Thus, APC cleavage of extracellular histones in the circulation appears to be a new mechanism contributing to its beneficial effects in sepsis.</p><p id="P7">To test the toxic effect of histones <italic>in vivo</italic>, we injected 75 mg histones per kg intravenously into mice. All mice (<italic>n</italic> = 5) died within one hour after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>). Co&#x02013;injection of recombinant APC (5 mg per kg) rescued all of the mice (<italic>n</italic> = 5) challenged with the same lethal dose of histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>). The ratio of APC to H3 used to rescue the mice <italic>in vivo</italic> is similar to that used in endothelial cytoprotection experiments. Mice challenged with a sublethal dose of histones (50 mg per kg) exhibited many of the characteristics of septic animals. <italic>In vivo</italic>, lungs exhibited neutrophil margination and accumulation in the alveolar microvessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b&#x02013;d</xref>), vacuolated endothelial and pulmonary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e&#x02013;f</xref>), intra&#x02013;alveolar hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4a, b</xref>), and platelet and fibrin&#x02013;rich microthrombi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4c, d, f and g</xref>), intra&#x02013;alveolar fibrin deposition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>) as well as fibrin and collagen accumulation within the inter&#x02013;alveolar septum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4f&#x02013;g</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To test the pathological significance of extracellular histones in the progression of the septic response, we co&#x02013;infused antibody to H4 with a high dose of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The antibody protected the mice, indicating that H4 is a major mediator of injury in sepsis. To test whether inhibition of histone cytotoxicity by endogenous APC does indeed play a significant role in protection from death in a model of sepsis, we challenged mice with a low dose of LPS in the absence or presence of an antibody to protein C. This antibody, which blocks protein C activation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, converted a non&#x02013;lethal into a lethal LPS dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This result is consistent with the recent finding that acute inflammation is exacerbated in mice genetically predisposed to a severe protein C deficiency<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and clinical observations that acquired severe protein C deficiency is associated with early death in septic patients<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Co&#x02013;infusion of H4 antibody rescued the mice from the lethality caused by LPS and the blockade of protein C activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In contrast, the antibody to histone H2B failed to rescue the mice. H3 was detected in plasma from mice challenged with a lethal dose of LPS and the levels of the H3 were reduced by treatment with H4 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), demonstrating a role of H4 in facilitating histone release. When a sublethal dose of LPS plus an antibody to protein C were injected into mice, the levels of H3 were higher than mice injected with LPS alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), demonstrating a role of APC in regulating extracellular histone levels <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P9">Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) is often considered a good animal model of sepsis. Antibody to H4 also reduced the mortality of mice in the CLP model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). We found that delay of treatment and the use of antibiotics were necessary to achieve a therapeutic benefit with the antibody treatment, perhaps because of the functions of histones in innate immunity<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p><p id="P10">TNF can also be used to elicit a hyper&#x02013;inflammatory state mimicking many aspects of sepsis<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Antibody to H4 reduced mortality in mice subjected to TNF injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Extracellular histones, mainly H3 and H4, appear to be both biomarkers of disease progression and therapeutic targets in sepsis and other inflammatory diseases. An effective histone blocking agent, such as the antibody described here, might prove therapeutic without the bleeding complications that can result from APC therapy. If effective, this approach is especially attractive in post surgical patients or patients with sepsis following trauma who are currently excluded from APC therapeutic intervention.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Reagents</title><p id="P12">Human protein C, bovine thrombin and rat monoclonal antibody to mouse protein C (MPC1609) were produced in our laboratory according to standard procedures<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.
