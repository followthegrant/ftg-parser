To be &#x0201c;caught&#x0201d; playing as an adult therefore risks embarrassment. Still, many designers want to create enjoyable, nonembarrassing play experiences for adults. To address this need, this article reads instances of spontaneous adult play through the lens of Erving Goffman&#x02019;s theory of the interaction order to unpack conditions and strategies for nonembarrassing adult play. It identifies established frames, segregated audiences, scripts supporting smooth performance, managing audience awareness, role distancing, and, particularly, alibis for play: Adults routinely provide alternative, adult-appropriate motives to account for their play, such as child care, professional duties, creative expression, or health. Once legitimized, the norms and rules of play themselves then provide an alibi for behavior that would risk being embarrassing outside play.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>accounts</kwd><kwd>adult play</kwd><kwd>adulthood</kwd><kwd>alibi</kwd><kwd>embarrassment</kwd><kwd>Erving Goffman</kwd><kwd>frame analysis</kwd><kwd>motivational accounting system</kwd><kwd>role distance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1555412017721086"><funding-source id="funding1-1555412017721086"><institution-wrap><institution>EPSRC/AHRC/InnovateUK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-1555412017721086">EP/M023265/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>

</p><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1555412017721086"><title>Introduction</title><p>A common saying has it that &#x0201c;play is the work of the child.&#x0201d; In contemporary Western societies, play is designated as a thing of children&#x02014;and children alone. To our ears, &#x0201c;adult play&#x0201d; is either oxymoron or euphemism. Rarely do we see adults in the street engage in a bout of free play. And when we do, children or dogs seem necessarily involved. Why is that?</p><p>Across societies, in any given situation, adults are expected to competently and appropriately enact their social roles. Beyond direct sanctions, they are compelled to do so by embarrassment, a social emotion that internalizes the imagined devaluation of one&#x02019;s self by others over incompetent or inappropriate acts (<xref rid="bibr25-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1967</xref>). Now even in societies less informed by a Protestant work ethic (<xref rid="bibr67-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Weber, 2010</xref>), play is considered the frivolous opposite of adult conduct (<xref rid="bibr62-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Sutton-Smith, 1997</xref>). Adults don&#x02019;t play, it follows, because play would be role-inappropriate and therefore embarrassing. Indeed, there is ample evidence that feared embarrassment shies adults away from playing with toys (<xref rid="bibr33-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Heljakka, 2013</xref>), pervasive games and public installations (<xref rid="bibr69-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Wouters et al., 2016</xref>), even interactive museum exhibits (<xref rid="bibr57-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Scott, Hinton-Smith, H&#x000e4;rm&#x000e4;, &#x00026; Broome, 2013</xref>).</p><p>And yet, from Bingo halls to bowling nights and Adult Fans of Lego, adults <italic>do</italic> play, regularly so, and often quite unashamedly. This contradicts the strict juxtaposition of play and adulthood but also raises the question <italic>when and how adults are able to engage in unembarrassed play</italic>. This question holds direct value to designers who wish to reduce embarrassment as a hurdle to engagement or evoke embarrassment in more experimental, aesthetic works (<xref rid="bibr21-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Deterding et al., 2015</xref>). While the literatures on play (<xref rid="bibr34-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Henricks, 2015</xref>) and embarrassment (<xref rid="bibr42-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Miller, 1997</xref>) are rich and growing, there is as of yet little connection between the two, therefore little understanding of <italic>how</italic> embarrassment comes about in adult play&#x02014;and thus, <italic>how</italic> designers might intentionally address it. To fill this gap, this article presents a theoretical account of the relation of adulthood, play, and embarrassment, grounded in Erving Goffman&#x02019;s analyses of face-to-face interaction. His work is particularly apt for the task, as it provides a coherent theoretical framework of both play and embarrassment and is broadly congruent with current empirical data (<xref rid="bibr18-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Deterding, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Miller, 1997</xref>). Like Goffman&#x02019;s own accounts (<xref rid="bibr68-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Williams, 1988</xref>), the following analysis draws on everyday data, existing studies, and thought experiments to inform and constrain theory and illustrate ramifications. It first presents Goffman&#x02019;s theory of the interaction order and embarrassment. It then unpacks how the social categories adulthood and play entail conflicting identity claims. From this, the article derives conditions and issues for nonembarrassing adult play as well as common techniques of deflecting embarrassment. The conclusion discusses emergent observations and open ends.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1555412017721086"><title>Theoretical Framework</title><p>To survive, humans have to maintain the affection, benevolence, and trust of their conspecifics. The functioning of society in turn depends on people behaving intelligibly and reliably. The <italic>interaction order</italic> (<xref rid="bibr27-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1983</xref>) is the social machinery that ensures both in everyday life, and social emotions are its fuel (<xref rid="bibr25-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1967</xref>). The interaction order captures the social orderings that obtain in <italic>response&#x02013;present interaction</italic>: when two or more people act in mutual reflexive perception and awareness (<xref rid="bibr27-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1983</xref>). Central to it is the &#x0201c;definition of the situation&#x0201d;: People make sense of actions based on what kind of situation they believe to be in. This sense-making relies on a shared repertoire of <italic>frames</italic>, reoccurring types of situations such as &#x0201c;going to the doctor&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;lecture&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr29-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1986</xref>). <italic>Framing</italic> is the usually taken-for-granted process by which actors constitute a situation as the instantiation of a specific frame. Frames differ from group to group and change over time. &#x0201c;Play&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;games&#x0201d; are everyday labels for a family of frames that share important meanings and norms (such as autotelic enjoyment) but also differ in many respects (<xref rid="bibr18-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Deterding, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Every frame entails a set of <italic>roles</italic> that can (and have to) be taken in by actors and defines what conduct is expected and appropriate for each role. During socialization, children internalize the frames and roles of their society&#x02014;for example, how to be a proper &#x0201c;guest&#x0201d; when &#x0201c;going to a restaurant.&#x0201d; In the same process, they become aware of and construct their <italic>self</italic> from other&#x02019;s responses to them across situations, become emotionally invested in this self, and adopt the values of their group regarding desirable self traits. In short, children start caring about <italic>face</italic>, &#x0201c;an image of self delineated in terms of approved social attributes&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr25-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1967</xref>, p. 5). <italic>Social emotions</italic> such as shame, pride, or embarrassment are the affective dimension of realizing or imagining how relevant others perceive and evaluate our self (<xref rid="bibr56-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Scheff, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bibr65-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Turner &#x00026; Stets, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Whenever individuals interact, they implicitly or explicitly project certain <italic>identity claims</italic> about their self: a competent cook, a kind nurse, or a polite passer-by (<xref rid="bibr25-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1967</xref>, pp. 105&#x02013;108). These claims are mainly determined by the roles individuals occupy in a given situational frame (the groom at the wedding), but identity claims can obtain across situations: One doesn&#x02019;t stop being (and having to be) a policeman, a daughter, or a gay rights activist at a wedding.</p><p>Whatever the specific roles and frames, the fundamental concern in any encounter is to maintain each other&#x02019;s face, chiefly by projecting and regarding valued and appropriate identities, fulfilling expectations connected to them, and keeping interaction flowing smoothly. As a social event, <italic>embarrassment</italic> occurs when the valued identity claims participants project in an encounter are somehow disconfirmed (<xref rid="bibr25-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1967</xref>, pp. 97&#x02013;112). Such disconfirming also disrupts the smooth flow of interaction: It creates a pause where everyone is torn into self-conscious awareness of the disruption with no ready script how to &#x0201c;move swiftly on,&#x0201d; restore lost face and get interaction going again. This in turn disconfirms every participant&#x02019;s basic valued identity as a benign and skilled interactant: Adults <italic>should</italic> &#x0201c;know not to embarrass each other&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;know what to say.&#x0201d; As an internal process, embarrassment is the sudden self-conscious awareness of such identity-disconfirming events, together with negative affect and arousal over seeing or imagining others who disapprove of us as a result. This motivates us to avoid embarrassment-prone situations and appease after an inappropriate action: blushing, apologies, and making amends all signal that the embarrassment was unintentional, that we feel bad about it, and can therefore be trusted to act competently and considerate in the future (<xref rid="bibr25-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1967</xref>, pp. 113&#x02013;114). All this makes embarrassment an important mechanism of social control.</p><p>In sum, embarrassment is overtly an event that publicly discredits active valued identity claims of participants in an encounter. It discredits identities of the embarrassed (e.g., being exposed in a white lie), the embarrasser (being exposed to be so inconsiderate as to let the truth slip), and possibly, all participants (being exposed as unskillful interactants not knowing how to get the conversation going again). Covertly, embarrassment is self-conscious awareness of and negative affect and arousal over the resultant (feared, imagined, and observed) devaluation of one&#x02019;s self by present or imagined others.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1555412017721086"><title>The Identity Claims of Adulthood and Play</title><p>Goffman&#x02019;s theory not only initiated sociological and psychological research on embarrassment: It is still in active use and congruent with current empirical data (<xref rid="bibr42-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Miller, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bibr65-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Turner &#x00026; Stets, 2006</xref>). Applying it to adult play immediately raises the question what identity claims are entailed in adulthood and play.</p><p>Like many cultural dualisms, adulthood is socially defined in contradistinction to childhood (<xref rid="bibr35-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins, 2008</xref>, p. 257). Beyond biological maturity, it marks the social status of being a &#x0201c;full&#x0201d; member of society as a &#x0201c;rational, objective, productive individual&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr46-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Moran, 1979</xref>, p. 24). According to contemporary (U.S. American) folk conceptions, becoming adult means becoming <italic>responsible</italic> (<xref rid="bibr1-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Arnett, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bibr2-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Adults are expected to fully and independently assess the ramifications of their actions against their own stable values and commitments, and self-regulate their conduct based on that. Second, adults are expected to be <italic>independently dependable</italic>. They should develop the capacity to sustain themselves and a household of (inter)dependent partners and children. Third, adults are expected to <italic>self-determinedly comply with social norms</italic>, without sanction or reminder. In short, the identity claim &#x0201c;adult&#x0201d; entails showing stable internal values and commitments; capable self-governance based on those mindful of others and social norms; and a capacity and concern for sustaining oneself and one&#x02019;s dependents (<xref rid="bibr1-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Arnett, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bibr2-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p><p>How does this sit with the social meanings of play (<xref rid="bibr33-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Heljakka, 2013</xref>, pp. 200&#x02013;235; <xref rid="bibr62-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Sutton-Smith, 1997</xref>)? Where adulthood stands for stable values, personality, and conduct, play signifies the Protean exploration of possible goals, selves, and behaviors. Play submits adult self-governance to arbitrary outer rules and the spontaneous flow of events. Adulthood puts responsibility for collective survival first (via productive work and social care), while play follows the selfish pleasure principle, an &#x0201c;occasion of pure waste&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr13-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Caillois, 2001</xref>, p. 55) that temporarily abdicates concerns for instrumental outcomes. Where adulthood means reliable, norm-abiding conduct, play signifies the immoderate, spontaneous, norm-breaching, always on the brink of dark play (<xref rid="bibr40-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Linderoth &#x00026; Mortensen, 2015</xref>). Finally, the main socially acknowledged function of play is to prepare for adulthood (<xref rid="bibr62-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Sutton-Smith, 1997</xref>). Hence to <italic>be</italic> adult is to <italic>not be</italic> in need of play anymore. All this is not to deny that there are abundant empirical instances of productive, regulated, and norm-abiding play. What matters here are the <italic>meanings</italic> ascribed to play in contemporary Western societies and, thus, the <italic>identity</italic> projected by overt acts of play.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1555412017721086"><title>Conditions of Legitimate Adult Play</title><p>Adulthood and play, then, claim fundamentally divergent identities. When we say that play is childish, we mean that it is irresponsibly pleasure-driven, unproductive, and not mindful of social norms. Given this clash, how do we explain unembarrassed adult play in the wild? If identity-<italic>incongruent</italic> acts embarrass, play should not embarrass adults when it is identity-<italic>congruent</italic>: When to play <italic>is</italic> to be an adult, predictable, responsible, productive, norm-minding member of society. For instance, it is the kindergarten teacher&#x02019;s adult job to play Patty Cake with children for their edification; to <italic>not</italic> do so while on duty would be inappropriate, as would be playing Patty Cake with adult strangers on a subway for fun. More generally, adult play should not embarrass when it presents the smooth, unselfconscious performance of appropriate identities as part of established social frames and roles. Let us unpack these conditions.</p><sec id="section5-1555412017721086"><title>Established Frames</title><p>First, we require an institutionalized frame within a particular social group: For instance, a shared understanding of &#x0201c;baseball&#x0201d; being &#x0201c;a thing,&#x0201d; and a thing adults can legitimately engage in. Else, one&#x02019;s behavior would be unintelligibly (and embarrassingly) strange. Beyond basic frames, people can <italic>reframe</italic> or &#x0201c;key&#x0201d; a given strip of activity, for example, do something ironically (<xref rid="bibr29-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1986</xref>, pp. 43&#x02013;74). While play itself may not be appropriate, its keying can be. Gambling is stigmatized, yet an actor can play a gambler in a theater production unspoilt&#x02014;if she manages to signal sufficient difference between role and person.</p><p>Frames legitimate play for <italic>particular persons</italic> in <italic>particular roles</italic> in <italic>particular situations</italic>. Playing on your mobile phone to pass time is fine for a commuter on a subway but not for a member of parliament during debate (<xref rid="bibr17-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Cresci, 2016</xref>). Continuing biographical identity claims may clash or align with play across multiple situations. For many, cross-dressing for a role in a school play embarrassingly disconfirms their valued gender identity.</p><p>One broad family of legitimate adult play frames are <italic>professional and social responsibilities</italic>. Parents, teachers, caretakers, therapists, trainers, game journalists all play in direct service of the well-being and education of others. For them, to play is to provide. Athletes and actors compete and perform for public edification and individual gain. Game and toy designers and scholars play to test, improve, and understand play as a professional subject matter. Such legitimate <italic>instrumental keyings</italic> of play-as-work (<xref rid="bibr18-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Deterding, 2014</xref>, pp. 325&#x02013;377) have also been called &#x0201c;play-to-order&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr61-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Stenros, 2015b</xref>, p. 93).</p><p>A second family is <italic>leisurely recreation</italic>. The adult demands of constant self-regulation, role conformity, and self-provision are socially recognized to be taxing. To cope, restore, and realize themselves as human beings, adults are allowed &#x0201c;activity enclaves&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr15-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Cohen &#x00026; Taylor, 1976</xref>, p. 97) where they can temporarily cop out of the other-determined routines of everyday life, lower self-regulation, engage in hedonic pursuits, and express and explore alternate identities and practices not fitting their official roles. Common instances are hobbies, games, mass media consumption, travel, or festivals (<xref rid="bibr15-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Cohen &#x00026; Taylor, 1976</xref>, pp. 77&#x02013;137; <xref rid="bibr53-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Ravenscroft &#x00026; Gilchrist, 2009</xref>). Mardi Gras is a well-studied example where out-of-character sexual behavior is framed as playful and accepted in public daylight (<xref rid="bibr54-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Redmon, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Notably, such enclaves aren&#x02019;t any <italic>less</italic> socially regulated, only <italic>differently</italic>. Each of these &#x0201c;institutionalized escapes&#x02026;<italic>has its time and its place</italic>&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr15-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Cohen &#x00026; Taylor, 1976</xref>, p. 113): They are frames with particular normal (and normative) motives, settings, objects, roles, scripts, and boundaries.

Like all frames, they come with limits that can be permissibly framed by them (<xref rid="bibr29-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1986</xref>, pp. 49&#x02013;52, 56).

Importantly, adult leisurely play is expected to <italic>subordinate</italic> to work and social responsibilities. Leisurely gaming takes place during evenings, weekends, or holidays, when all other obligations are &#x0201c;done for the day&#x0201d; or in &#x0201c;empty times&#x0201d; like a subway commute (<xref rid="bibr18-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Deterding, 2014</xref>). Two contributions in the present special issue directly testify to this subordination norm: Group sex events are scheduled in advance to allow participating parents to arrange babysitters (<xref rid="bibr32-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Harviainen &#x00026; Frank, 2016</xref>, p. 10); board gaming parents fit their hobby into their parental duties by playing with their children or shifting gameplay to times when the children are in bed (<xref rid="bibr55-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Rogerson &#x00026; Gibbs, 2016</xref>).

To consider an activity &#x0201c;normal,&#x0201d; a sufficient number of others has to explicitly or implicitly signal that it is normal (<xref rid="bibr26-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1972</xref>, p. 72). As threshold models of collective behavior like rioting predict, actors will engage in a behavior once the proportion of perceived others engaging in it tips the benefits minus costs of engaging over those of not engaging (<xref rid="bibr30-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Granovetter, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="bibr48-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Oliver, 1993</xref>). Given enough dancers on the dance floor, the risk of being seen wrongly claiming performance-worthy dancing skills becomes smaller than the risk of being spotted as a spoilsport on the edge (leaving potential enjoyment benefits of dancing aside for the moment). As individuals may have different thresholds, cascade dynamics become likely. The moment one very low-threshold dancer &#x0201c;breaks the ice,&#x0201d; their social proof may be enough to tip people with the next higher thresholds over the edge and so on. This dynamic is recognized as one aspect of the so-called honeypot effect (<xref rid="bibr69-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Wouters et al., 2016</xref>). Other people visibly engaging with a public interface stimulate passers-by to likewise approach, observe, and engage with it. Put differently, <italic>audience aggregation</italic> is another relevant strategy for deflecting embarrassment. Festivals for instance aggregate a self-selecting group of people into spatiotemporal response-presence who feature highly approval of and low engagement thresholds for the celebrated play activity. Surrounded by hundreds of other cosplayers in costume, we feel normal in our faux-troll second skin.</p></sec><sec id="section12-1555412017721086"><title>Awareness Management</title><p>Physically removing audiences is one way of deflecting their perceived disapproval. Another is to interrupt the mutual perception between actor and audience: Be it that the audience is absent in the actor&#x02019;s awareness, be it that the actor is visibly absent in the audience&#x02019;s. The latter is another embarrassment-reducing dynamic of large group play. The more people there are in a street game, the less the individual has to fear that disapproving eyes fall on her in particular. Dark rooms, costumes, masks, pseudonyms, and avatars also serve this function. They make actors visible but not <italic>identifiable</italic>. During the immersive theater productions of Punchdrunk, I observed many uninhibited behaviors by mask-wearing audience members. Similarly, concerns for embarrassment recede when individuals become engrossed in an activity. In personal observation, when adults try out VR gaming for the first time, they first show high anxious awareness of how silly they must look wearing a headset and making strange gestures, but as goggles and headphones cut off perception of the audience and gameplay demands their full attention, this anxiety vanishes, only to return with shocked realization when they take headset and headphone of and perceive their (often laughing) audience.</p></sec><sec id="section13-1555412017721086"><title>Role Distancing</title><p>A final deflection strategy is <italic>role distancing</italic>, &#x0201c;actions which effectively convey some disdainful detachment of the performer from a role he is performing&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr26-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1972</xref>, p. 110). <xref rid="bibr51-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Peterson (2011</xref>, pp. 145&#x02013;170) documents a nice instance. When she asked two young adolescent boys to play the &#x0201c;girl game&#x0201d; <italic>The Sims 2</italic>, they immediately managed the identity threat by keying into nonserious, parodist play, creating the to-them-absurd characters of an overweight, Black homosexual couple. With smiles, giggles, expletives, gesturing, and mimicking, they constantly signaled how ridiculous and mock-offensive all this play is.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section14-1555412017721086"><title>Conclusions and Elisions</title><p>Embarrassment arises when people become aware of imagined or real others perceiving events disconfirming their valued identities. The social meanings of play&#x02014;unruly, pleasure-driven, free, and unproductive&#x02014;disconfirm the valued social identity of being a self-regulated, norm-abiding, and productive adult. Hence, play risks embarrassing adults. And yet, there are instances when adults <italic>do</italic> play unembarrassedly. To resolve this paradox, we unpacked conditions and strategies for unembarrassed adult play. Unembarrassed play requires an established frame of legitimate play; we found two families of such frames, professional responsibilities like play-as-child care and leisurely recreation like hobbies. It requires that valued identities and situational role expectations don&#x02019;t clash, which is facilitated by physically segregating audiences with differing expectations or by enacting distance to a clashing situationally demanded role. It requires clearly framing the given activity as an instance of a legitimate frame, supported by physical framing signals and aggregating audiences that mutually signal the normalcy of play by joining in, cheering, or not minding. It requires smooth performance of role expectations, made easier by clear scripts, rules, and fallback routines. It requires appropriately deep involvement in play and lowered self-consciousness of one&#x02019;s public appearance, aided by engrossing activities and masks, pseudonymous avatars, or hiding in a crowd, disrupting the response-presence of others.</p><p>Finally, we found that the most obvious motivation for play&#x02014;autotelic enjoyment&#x02014;also sits in most direct tension with adult identity. To account for their play, adults therefore regularly resort to <italic>alibis</italic>, motivational accounts that deflect negative inference from their play behavior to their character. Adults account for play as <italic>serving</italic> their adult responsibilities: be it that it is part of gainful labor or providing for others; be it that it nurtures their health and productive faculties; be it that it serves communal cohesion or artistic expression; or be it that it is re-grounded as charity or a joke. To play as an adult&#x02014;legitimately, unembarrassed&#x02014;is to play responsibly. As one of the countless guidelines for &#x0201c;responsible gambling&#x0201d; puts it: &#x0201c;Don&#x02019;t let gambling interfere with family, friends or work.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1555412017721086">3</xref></sup></p><p>This observation underlines the general methodological caveat that why people <italic>do</italic> things and why they <italic>say</italic> they do things are often different (<xref rid="bibr10-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Briggs, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Mills, 1940</xref>)&#x02014;a caveat rarely heeded in contemporary research on gameplay motivation that takes participants&#x02019; statements at face value (<xref rid="bibr9-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2012</xref>, pp. 775&#x02013;777). But it also highlights something distinct about play: While we routinely take the legitimacy of activities like working or studying for granted, adult play today remains contested and precarious, subservient to productivity norms. Take the following news story on a recent study by three economists. They observed that from 2004 to 2014, a significant and growing portion of noncollege-educated young men in the United States chose to displace wage labor time with playing video games. Given a lack of good job opportunities, this choice increased their life satisfaction. However, far from congratulating the young men on their economically rational preference maximization, the economists and reporting journalist paint this as a social problem: &#x0201c;if a historically vibrant portion of the population doesn&#x02019;t feel as much desire to work, this could harm the economy&#x02019;s future and the ability of government to use policy to create jobs&#x0201d;, or as one quoted economist put it: &#x0201c;That&#x02019;s a big chunk of labor that could be used for something, and we&#x02019;re not using it&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr63-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Swanson, 2016</xref>). Labor, historically viewed as divine punishment or the means to leisure, here is the taken-for-granted end of adult life, while adult leisurely play remains ever suspicious and in need of justification. The Protestant work ethic seems alive and well (<xref rid="bibr67-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Weber, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Maybe for this reason, most frames of legitimate adult play incorporate the full gamut of conditions, strategies, and alibis. German carnival for instance provides a well-established festival frame legitimized by tradition, huge play groups and lavish decoration establishing a clear framing, easy-to-follow scripts reducing required competence, the alibi of collective obligatory participation and intoxication, and ample awareness shields (masks, costumes, large crowds, loud music). It also demonstrates another fact: To not participate in an ongoing encounter of legitimate adult play is itself an embarrassing norm breach. Those whose persisting biographical identities clash with the identity of a carnival-goer but feel the social pressure to participate are easily recognizable by the most severe (and chagrined) acts of mock involvement, ironic meta-commentary, and role distancing. Or by leaving town for the duration.</p><p>Similarly, our analysis suggests multiple reasons why <italic>games</italic> are more suited for unembarrassed adult play than <italic>free play</italic>. Games are highly institutionalized and conventionalized and as such easily signaled and recognized; they come prelegitimized with imputed motives of recreation, family quality time, and so on; they are designed to be highly absorbing, leaving little mental reserve to become self-conscious (compared to the many pauses and stops of free play); they are highly scripted, ensuring smooth interaction and requiring little spontaneous creativity; and their rules offer established alibis for in-game actions.</p><p>Now nothing here is special. The conditions of embarrassment and means of deflecting it that obtain in adult play obtain for any social frame. If anything, the boundedness of play lends itself nicely to develop general theories. &#x0201c;Games seem to display in a simple way the structure of real-life situations&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr26-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1972</xref>, p. 32). The present essay is very much an exercise in this spirit.</p><p>As a sociological account, it necessarily foregoes individual difference and change. Psychology tells us that people have different degrees of embarrassability and that concern for how others perceive us can be unlearned (<xref rid="bibr42-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Miller, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, as a synchronic snapshot of one society, the present analysis is blind to cultural and historical differences and trajectories. How do &#x0201c;our&#x0201d; norms of legitimate adult play compare to those of other cultures and centuries? To what extent are the &#x0201c;ludification of culture&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr19-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Deterding, 2015a</xref>), the appearance of &#x0201c;emergent adulthood&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr3-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Arnett, 2007</xref>), &#x0201c;cultural neoteny&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr31-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Harrison, 2014</xref>), or postmodern &#x0201c;infantilization&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr5-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Bernadini, 2014</xref>) shifting the grounds of play and adulthood? To empirically trace the boundaries of embarrassment in adult play is to put such high-level descriptions of social change to the test. Just as Plato suggested that play reveals the natural dispositions of an individual, studying &#x0201c;what categories of persons become embarrassed in what recurrent situations&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr25-1555412017721086" ref-type="bibr">Goffman, 1967</xref>, p. 109) may tell us much about the state of our societies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn4-1555412017721086"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn5-1555412017721086"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was conducted in the Digital Creativity Labs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://digitalcreativity.ac.uk">digitalcreativity.ac.uk</ext-link>), jointly funded by EPSRC/AHRC/InnovateUK under grant no EP/M023265/1.</p></fn></fn-group><bio id="d35e46"><title>Author Biography</title><p><bold>Sebastian Deterding</bold> is a researcher-designer working on gameful and playful experiences for human flourishing.
