Among these, uropathogenic <italic>E.coli</italic> often co-express the virulence-associated siderophore yersiniabactin (Ybt) along with catecholate siderophores. Here we used a novel mass-spectrometric screening approach to reveal that yersiniabactin is also a physiologically favorable copper (II) ligand. Direct mass-spectrometric detection of the resulting Cu(II)-Ybt complex in mice and humans with <italic>E. coli</italic> urinary tract infections demonstrates copper binding to be a physiologically relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction during infection. Yersiniabactin expression corresponded to higher copper resistance among human urinary tract isolates, suggesting a protective role for this interaction. Chemical and genetic characterization showed that yersiniabactin helps bacteria resist copper toxicity by sequestering host-derived copper (II) and preventing its catechol-mediated reduction to copper (I). Together, these studies reveal a new virulence-associated function for yersiniabactin that is distinct from iron binding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Siderophores are a chemically diverse group of secondary metabolites used extensively by microbes &#x02013; and possibly higher vertebrates &#x02013; to bind and acquire ferric iron (see review)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.

The marked chemical diversity and differential iron-binding affinities among siderophores raises the possibility that some may have evolved to bind non-ferric metal ions to fulfill additional physiologic functions.

This fragmentation pathway resulted in a 187 mass unit neutral loss, consistent with rearrangement of the C13-C14 bond to lose the carboxy-terminal thiazoline (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>S, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a and 1b</xref>). To identify biologically relevant metal-Ybt complexes, we added <italic>apo</italic>-Ybt to pooled urine samples from six healthy donors and analyzed the mixture using LC-CNL over a mass range encompassing the calculated range of naturally-occurring terrestrial metal complexes (<sup>6</sup>Li to <bold><sup>239</sup></bold>Pu). The LC-CNL ion chromatogram revealed formation of a dominant, novel analyte with <italic>m/z</italic> 543 (peak 1, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) in addition to a peak corresponding to Fe(III)-Ybt and its deuterated internal standard (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Results</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1a and 1b</xref>). The new peak 1 was absent in urine alone treated with internal standard or when <italic>apo</italic>-Ybt was added to water (data not shown). Although urine is a highly complex mixture containing thousands of small biomolecules, the simplicity of the resulting chromatograms suggested that the 187 mass unit loss is highly specific to Ybt. Peak 1 matched no previously reported spectra, also exhibited a neutral loss of 187 mass units, and was formed by adding <italic>apo</italic>-Ybt to urine, suggesting formation of a new and biologically plausible yersiniabactin complex.</p><p id="P6">Peak 1 was first subjected to additional mass analyses. The CNL mass spectrum of this complex exhibited a prominent M+2 peak at <italic>m/z</italic> 545, approximately one third the height of the base peak. MS/MS analysis of the M and M+2 peaks at <italic>m/z</italic> 543 and 545 exhibited product ion spectra with identical fragmentation patterns differing by 2 mass units (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>). The <italic>apo</italic>-Ybt spectrum lacked this prominent M+2 peak, suggesting a prominent isotope-pattern contribution from the unknown Ybt binding partner (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>). A Ybt-derived base peak ion 61 mass units higher than the Ybt [M+H]<sup>+</sup> ion with a prominent M+2 isotope peak was consistent with a singly charged cupric complex of the form [Ybt+Cu(II)-H]<sup>+</sup>. The observed isotopic pattern was consistent with the natural <sup>63</sup>Cu and <sup>65</sup>Cu isotope abundances of 77% and 23%, respectively<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. The <italic>m/z</italic> value of this complex was consistent with the presence of copper (II), rather than copper (I), which would require an additional proton to yield a singly charged ion at <italic>m/z</italic> 544, rather than the observed 543.</p><p id="P7">Further confirmation was pursued by adding molar excess of copper (II) sulfate to UTI89 &#x00394;<italic>entB</italic> (which produces Ybt as the only siderophore) culture supernatant, followed by preparative chromatography. Application of this copper(II)-treated supernatant to a preparative C18 column resulted in retention of a blue-colored fraction on the column that was eluted with 80% methanol. The LC-MS chromatogram of this blue fraction was dominated by peak 1. This fraction was subjected to accurate mass determination on a Bruker Q-TOF Maxis using positive ion electrospray mode, which again showed the prominent M+2 ion and supported the formula C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>25</sub>CuN<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>S<sub>3</sub> for peak 1 ion at 543.0393 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).

One micromolar <italic>apo</italic>-yersiniabactin was then added to these samples and the Cu(II)-Ybt/Fe(III)-Ybt ratio was determined by LC-MS following a two-hour incubation.

These findings demonstrate that a typical urinary pathogen expresses Ybt during murine infections, and that a greater abundance of copper (II) complexed siderophore is subsequently detected in biological samples derived from infected mice.</p><p id="P11">To determine whether Ybt is expressed and binds copper during human urinary tract infections, we analyzed 32 midstream urine samples from a cohort of women with acute cystitis for Cu(II)-Ybt. LC-MS/MS analysis of cultured urinary pathogen isolates from these patients confirmed infection by a Ybt-expressor in 15 out of 32 subjects. Scanning neutral loss analysis of urine from a patient infected with a Ybt-expressing strain revealed a strong Cu(II)-Ybt signal with the expected <italic>m/z</italic> 543 ion and its characteristic <sup>65</sup>Cu isotopomer at <italic>m/z</italic> 545, confirming <italic>in vivo</italic> formation of Cu(II)-Ybt (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Quantitative analysis using <sup>13</sup>C-labeled internal standards demonstrated significantly (p&#x0003c;0.0001) higher urinary Cu(II)-Ybt levels in patients infected with Ybt expressors (13/15 positive) than in patients infected with non-expressors (0 of 17 positive) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that uropathogenic <italic>E.coli</italic> can express Ybt during human urinary tract infections and that this Ybt binds host-derived copper.</p><p id="P12">To determine whether the extent of <italic>in vivo</italic> copper and iron binding was similar, we measured the Cu(II)-Ybt/Fe(III)-Ybt molar ratio in urine (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). In the 13 samples with detectable Ybt complexes, the median Cu(II)-Ybt/Fe(III)-Ybt ratio was 2.9 (range= 0.12&#x02013;20.9) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) with 92% (12/13) patients exhibiting a molar ratio &#x0003e;1.

By binding copper ions, Ybt may act as a pathogenic countermeasure to copper toxicity.

Together, these data show that urinary isolates exhibit greater copper resistance than non-urinary isolates in a UTI patient population and that enhanced copper resistance is strongly associated with Ybt production.</p><p id="P15">To determine whether Ybt production has a functional impact on copper resistance, we compared the Ybt-deficient mutant UTI89&#x00394;<italic>ybtS</italic> to the wild type uropathogen control UTI89.

Over a range of 5 to 25 &#x003bc;M copper (II) sulfate, wild type cultures yielded an average of 1.34 log more CFUs than UTI89&#x00394;<italic>ybtS</italic> cultures (<italic>p</italic>=0.0032, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). To confirm that Cu(II)-Ybt is expressed in this experimental system, we performed LC-MS analysis of culture supernatants treated with 25 &#x003bc;M copper (II) sulfate.

Together, these findings show that intact Ybt gene plays a mechanistic role in copper resistance.</p><p id="P16">To determine whether Ybt directly protects bacteria from copper toxicity, we examined the effect of purified <italic>apo</italic>-Ybt on viability of UTI89&#x00394;<italic>ybtS</italic> (Ybt biosynthesis mutant) cultures exposed to 10&#x003bc;M copper sulfate (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Copper addition alone resulted in a substantial &#x0003e;3 log CFU/mL decrease in bacterial viability. <italic>Apo</italic>-Ybt protected copper-treated bacteria almost completely from cytotoxicity, with only a 0.024 log decrease in viable cells compared to wild type (p = NS).

These results show that copper binding by exogenous Ybt directly protects bacteria from copper toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Yersiniabactin prevents Cu(II) reduction by catecholates</title><p id="P17">To determine whether other UPEC siderophores affect copper susceptibility, we evaluated copper toxicity in established UTI89 mutants with defined siderophore deficiencies<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). As noted above, UTI89&#x00394;<italic>ybtS</italic> was more susceptible to copper than the wild type strain (p = 0.0021). Conversely, additional deletion of the catecholate biosynthesis gene <italic>entB</italic> in this strain background (an &#x00394;<italic>entB</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ybtS</italic> double mutant), significantly (p = 0.0032) increased survival. The single &#x00394;<italic>entB</italic> mutant<italic>,</italic> which expresses Ybt, exhibited a supraphysiological survival benefit in the presence of copper. These results are consistent with previous work describing copper (II) reduction by catechols to more toxic copper (I) ions<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">To test whether the absence of copper reduction by catecholate siderophores explains increased copper resistance in the the UTI89&#x00394;<italic>entB</italic> mutant, we examined copper toxicity to UTI89 in the presence and absence of enterobactin or 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), the catecholate moiety incorporated into enterobactin and salmochelin. Treatment with 10 &#x003bc;M copper (II) sulfate alone caused a 2.5 log reduction of viable colonies. While 20 &#x003bc;M enterobactin or DHB alone had a minimal effect, their addition to copper (II) sulfate significantly (p&#x0003c;0.0072 and p&#x0003c;0.0039, respectively) increased copper cytotoxicity, decreasing viable cells to below the level of detection (LOD = 20 CFU/mL) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). These data show that antibacterial synergy between enterobactin and copper (II) is attributable to enterobactin&#x02019;s catecholate groups.</p><p id="P19">To confirm that enterobactin reduces copper (II) and to determine whether Ybt affects this reaction, we monitored copper (I) formation by purified reagents using a bathocuproine-based spectrophotometric assay (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Addition of either 20 &#x003bc;M enterobactin or DHB to samples containing 17.5 &#x003bc;M copper (II) sulfate resulted in a strong bathocuproine signal corresponding to 84.7% and 93.1% reduction of copper (II) to copper (I), respectively. This signal was almost completely blocked when <italic>apo</italic>-Ybt was added before enterobactin or DHB. In contrast, changing the order of addition such that enterobactin or DHB were added before <italic>apo</italic>-Ybt restored the copper (I) signal. Together, these results demonstrate that the catecholate groups of enterobactin and related siderophores reduce copper (II) to more cytotoxic copper (I) and that yersiniabactin protects bacteria not only by sequestering copper (II) but also by inhibiting its catecholate-mediated reduction.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">Although yersiniabactin and catecholate siderophores are regarded as redundant iron-acquisition molecules, this study shows that they assume disparate roles in modulating copper chemistry and toxicity at the host-pathogen interface.

Precedent for microbial copper chelation is found among environmental bacteria<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. While not a siderophore, methanobactin serves an analogous function by binding Cu(I) to satisfy a high nutritional copper requirement driven by synthesis of a particulate methane-monooxygenase, which accounts for up to 20% of methanotrophic bacterial proteins<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.

Although our data are consistent with protective copper sequestration as a yersiniabactin function, yersiniabactin could benefit bacteria by obtaining copper as a nutritional source under other circumstances.

This question is readily addressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, where disease-associated strains exhibit evidence of multiple virulence-associated adaptations. By demonstrating enhanced copper-resistance among disease-associated isolates, this study suggests an important role for copper ions as an antimicrobial defense in human UTI pathogenesis. A role for copper-based immune defenses is further supported by observations of infection-associated increases in copper<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and use of copper transporters by phagocytic cells to kill internalized bacteria<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>.

Copper (II) is significantly more bactericidal when reduced to its copper (I) valence, which has been attributed to an improved ability of copper (I) to generate reactive oxygen species or to freely penetrate bacterial membranes and inactivate intracellular iron-sulfur clusters<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Thus, yersiniabactin&#x02019;s ability to prevent copper (II) reduction and intracellular penetration may additionally protect pathogenic bacteria during infection. Targeting yersiniabactin biosynthesis or the strains that perform this may thus be a useful therapeutic approach. Although it is unclear which yersiniabactin coordination sites facilitate copper binding, it is notable that this molecule contains three nitrogenous heterocycles (thiazolines/thiazolidine), reminiscent of imidazole-rich copper coordination sites in ceruloplasmin<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and the nitrogen heterocycles in methanobactin<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>.

To date, neither pathogenic siderophore secretion nor <italic>in vivo</italic> metal ion selectivity of these siderophores have been directly observed and quantified.

upon CID fragmentation of the positive ESI-derived ion. This neutral loss is consistent with rearrangement to lose the terminal carboxylated thiazoline. (b) A 187 mass unit neutral loss is evident in MS/MS product ion spectra of ferric-yersiniabactin (Fe(III)-Ybt) at <italic>m/z</italic> 535, aluminum-yersiniabactin (Al(III)-Ybt) at <italic>m/z</italic> 506, and gallium-yersiniabactin (Ga(III)-Ybt) at <italic>m/z</italic> 548. A constant neutral loss (CNL) scan based on this conserved fragmentation pathway was used as a metallomic screen to identify physiologic yersiniabactin binding partners. (c) Representative constant neutral loss chromatograms of urine samples in the presence and absence of purified <italic>apo</italic>-yersiniabactin. The combination of <italic>apo</italic>-yersiniabactin and urine results in formation of a prominent new peak (peak 1). Peaks corresponding to the internal standard (int. std) are indicated. These results were confirmed in three independent experiments. (d) High resolution positive ion ESI mass spectrum is consistent with the empiric formula for a singly charged Cu(II)-Ybt ion and demonstrates the prominent natural abundance M+2 ion expected from <sup>65</sup>Cu. (d) Competitive binding experiments were conducted by titrating cupric sulfate into solutions containing a fixed concentration of 0.01 M ferric chloride and 0.01 M <italic>apo</italic>-yersiniabactin. Data indicate competitive binding between cupric and ferric ion for the ligand. Cu(II)-Ybt/Fe(III)-Ybt ratios were determined by comparing selected ion chromatogram peak ratios to those from a standard curve.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms444903f1"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Cupric-yersiniabactin is produced in cystitis patients infected with yersiniabactin-producing strains</title><p>(a) A scanning constant neutral loss spectrum reveals the spectrum for Cu(II)-Ybt at its expected retention time.

Growth was determined and expressed as total CFU/mL. (a) Urinary strains demonstrate greater resistance to copper toxicity than coexisting rectal strains. For each patient, CFU/mL from the non-urinary strain was subtracted from CFU/mL from the coincident urinary strain to yield a difference. In the four patients from whom multiple coincident urinary and non-urinary strains were recovered, the mean difference in colony forming units is reported. The median value of these differences was 2.11 x 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mL, with a range of &#x02212;5.4 x 10<sup>3</sup> to 1.66 x 10<sup>8</sup>.

Samples containing copper alone demonstrated a &#x0003e;3 log CFU/mL decrease in viability. <italic>Apo</italic>-yersiniabactin (<italic>apo</italic>-Ybt) addition restores growth to untreated wild type levels (<italic>p</italic> = ns). This cytoprotective effect is unique to <italic>apo</italic>-yersiniabactin, and is not observed upon addition of pre-formed Cu(II)-Ybt. These results were confirmed in three independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms444903f3"/></fig><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Catecholate siderophores and yersiniabactin exert opposing effects on copper cytotoxicity</title><p>(a) Growth of wild type (UTI89), yersiniabactin (&#x00394;<italic>ybtS</italic>), catecholate siderophore (&#x00394;<italic>entB</italic>), or total siderophore (&#x00394;<italic>entB</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ybtS</italic>) expression mutants in the presence of copper was determined. Results were consistent with copper-dependent cytoprotective effect for yersiniabactin and cytotoxic effect for catecholate siderophores. (b) Exogenous addition of 20 &#x003bc;M of the siderophore enterobactin, or its catecholate moiety 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) enhances copper (II) sulfate toxicity in UTI89. (c) <italic>Apo-</italic>yersiniabactin prevents catechol-dependent reduction of copper (II) sulfate to copper (I) in an order-of-addition dependent manner. The complete reaction system consisted of 17.5 &#x003bc;M copper(II) sulfate, either 20 &#x003bc;M enterobactin (ent) or its catecholate moiety 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), 25 &#x003bc;M <italic>apo</italic>-yersiniabactin (Ybt), and 25 &#x003bc;M of the copper(I) indicator bathocuproine sulfonate. Reagents were added in the order indicated and Cu(I)-bathocuproine absorbance was determined 30 min after addition of the last reagent. Results were confirmed in three independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms444903f4"/></fig></floats-group></article>
