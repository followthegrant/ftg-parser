practical skill. It is a complex process, both for the professionals who provide care,
and for researchers <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The challenge becomes more
evident when related to the pain assessment in children with neurological impairment,
especially of the cognitive system and speech.</p><p>Among the most prevalent pathologies that compromise the neurological system of the
child stands out Cerebral Palsy (CP), which affects around 2 to 3:1000 live births in
developed countries <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>and anchors the focus of this
study.</p><p>CP is defined as a group of disorders of the development of posture and movement,
causing restriction of activity, attributed to non-progressive disturbances in the brain
during fetal development or infancy. The motor disorders of CP are often accompanied by
sensory, cognitive, communication and perception disturbances, occurring or not
behavioral disorders and convulsive process <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. In
view of this complexity, the use of validated and reliable pain assessment tools is a
recommended practice<sup>(4-5)</sup>.</p><p>Among the structured tools for pain assessment in children with neurological impairment,
stands out the <italic>Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability revised
</italic>(FLACCr).</p><p>The FLACC scale of pain assessment was developed in 1997, based on behavioral
parameters, intended for use by health professionals and aiming at contributing to
clinical practice in pain assessment in nonverbal children or with speech impairment,
which are unable to report their pain <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Since
2002, the authors of the FLACC scale made modifications in the evaluation descriptors,
in order to adapt it to the care of children with cognitive impairment, aged between 4
and 19 years. The authors named it FLACC revised (FLACCr) or revised FLACC
(rFLACC)<sup>(5-7)</sup>, and changed and expanded to four the number of application
instructions of the scale.</p><p>The FLACCr presents five evaluation categories, with combined scores ranging from zero
to ten. The author classified the scores as follows: zero to three (mild pain); four to
six (moderate pain) and seven to ten (severe pain).</p><p>Given the paucity of research on systematic pain assessment in children with CP, this
study aimed to perform the translation into Brazilian Portuguese and cultural adaptation
of the FLACCr scale of pain assessment with children affected by CP, presenting
cognitive impairment or not and unable to report their pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This is a methodological development study for translation into Portuguese and cultural
adaptation of the FLACCr scale of pain assessment. After formal authorization from the
author of the scale, the study was developed in two stages: translation into Brazilian
Portuguese and cultural adaptation of the FLACCr scale of pain assessment. The study was
submitted to the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, and approved
under protocol number 1480/10.</p><p>The criteria for translation and cultural adaptation of the FLACCr scale into Portuguese
followed a specific model, considering three stages: translation and back-translation,
evaluation of translation and backtranslation and cultural equivalence <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Translation into Portuguese and back-translation into English</title><p>Translation and back-translation were performed by two independent certified
translators, not belonging to the healthcare area, with fluency in both languages,
inclusive in their colloquial forms.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of translation and back-translation by an expert committee</title><p>Five experts were invited, according to the following inclusion criteria: fluency in
English; availability to participate in the project by the final consensus on the
instrument; master's degree as minimum postgraduate level, on the theme "Pain in the
pediatric/neonatal population"; practice in clinical pediatric for over a year;
experience in assisting child with CP (with or without comorbidities) and other
neurological disorders (periods stratified in the questionnaire); and formal acceptance
of their participation by signing the Free Informed Consent Form.</p><p>The method used to achieve consensus was the Delphi technique, which ensures anonymity
of the experts, with absolute confidentiality of the responses. The evaluation was
performed based on the set of these experts' responses. The method allowed to achieve
consensus among a group of experts on a phenomenon of a certain area of knowledge <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>.</p><p>To carry out the evaluation of the FLACCr, it was used the Likert scale, which is based
on the indication of a degree of agreement or disagreement of the translation and back
translation, comparing them with the original scale. In this process, it was included
the five evaluation categories/indicators and the four scale application instructions.
For each item evaluated the following classification was used: Strongly Disagree (SD);
Disagree (D); Neither Agree Nor Disagree (NAND); Agree (A); Strongly Agree (SA).</p><p>It was asked to the experts to assess the semantic equivalence, idiomatic equivalence
and experimental or cultural equivalence <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. This
evaluation also aimed to verify the validation of the content of the scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Cultural equivalence</title><p>This phase aimed to analyze the equivalence between the original and final versions of
the scale. It was opted for the investigative technique, which recommends a sample of
participants, preferably between 30 and 40, to evaluate the final version of the scale
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Accordingly, 38 professionals were invited
(18 nurses, 10 physicians and 10 physiotherapists), and 30 (78.9%) returned the
completed questionnaires.</p><p>These professionals evaluated the title, the five categories of pain assessment proposed
in the FLACCr scale, with their respective descriptors and the four scale's application
instructions, according to the following attributes <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>: Comprehensibility - the category evaluated expressed clarity and
intelligibility; Simplicity - the category evaluated expressed one idea; Objectivity -
the assessed category allows one response, considering the behaviors described; Typicity
- the evaluated category is expressed in a consistent or typical way proper of the
assessed category; Relevance - the category evaluated expresses relevance with
consistent phrases; Credibility - the evaluated category is described in a way that does
not seem uncharacteristic or unreasonable.</p><p>The evaluation of each attribute was performed by means of the Likert scale, with the
classifications SD, D, NAND, A and SA.</p><p>Some researchers consider that the minimum consensus levels are between 50% and 80%
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1213</xref>. Therefore, it was selected the minimum
level of agreement of 80%, both for the five experts, in the consensus phase of the
translation and cultural equivalence, as for the 30 professionals who participated in
the cultural adaptation phase.</p><p>The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, measurements of absolute and
relative frequencies of the responses emitted by the committee of five experts and by
the 30 health professionals, considering levels of agreement equal to or greater than
80%. The results were obtained by the sum of the values of the classification items SA
and A of the Likert scale.</p><p>The final version of the instrument back-translated into English was sent to the author
of the original scale, and had full agreement with the Brazilian version.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The participants of the experts committee were a physician and four nurses, respecting
all the inclusion criteria previously established. The translated and backtranslated
versions of the scale were sent to the experts for consensus, thus constituting the
first round of evaluation.</p><p>In the results of the expert committee, it was observed that the instrument had not
achieved consensus equal to or greater than 80% in the translation and backtranslation
of the categories: Face (60% consensus in translation and 40% in back-translation),
Activity (40% consensus in translation and 50% in back-translation), Cry (60% consensus
in translation and 50% in backtranslation), Consolability (60% consensus in translation
and 60% in back- translation), 1<sup>st</sup> scale application instruction (60%
consensus in translation and 60% in back-translation), 2<sup>nd</sup>instruction (40%
consensus in translation), 3<sup>rd</sup> instruction (60% consensus in translation and
60% in back-translation) and 4<sup>th</sup>instruction (20% consensus in translation and
20% in back-translation).</p><p>The description of the Activity category, in the score 1, was sent to the author of the
original scale, to clarify the term splinting, as suggested by one of the experts. The
author explained that this word is related to the respiratory condition of the child,
contributing to the consensus of the committee. The word gasping was maintained in
English, because there is no translation into Portuguese and it is often used in
clinical practice.</p><p>The suggestions of the committee were adopted, continuing the second round of evaluation
by the experts.</p><p>By receiving the versions of the second round, it was identified a lack of consensus for
the 4<sup>th</sup> scale application instruction. The researchers considered the
suggestions of the experts, requiring a third round. After the versions of the committee
has returned, it was identified agreement equal to or greater than 80% in all categories
of the scale.</p><p>The author of the original scale asked to maintain the title as it stands in English
(FLACCr), with possible insertion of the letter "r" at the beginning or end of the
title. Consequently, the symbol FLACCr was maintained in the Portuguese version spoken
in Brazil, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>

</p><p>In the cultural equivalence phase, of the 30 participating professionals, 18 were
nurses, six physicians and six physiotherapists. Of the total, 28 (93.3%) were female
and 26 (86.6%) had professional training time and time of performance in pediatrics
greater than 10 years. When they were asked about the approximate frequency of
assistance to children with CP in the last year, 11 (36.6%) responded that daily took
care of children with CP, 11 (36.6%) took care often (more than once a month), seven
(23.6%) took care few times (once every two months) and one (3.2%) rarely took care
(once every three months).</p><p>The professionals evaluated the five categories of the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and
Consolability scale, considering the attributes Comprehensibility, Simplicity and
Objectivity, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, and Typicity,
Relevance and Credibility, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table

to 100% (95.5% average); Legs from 83.3% to 93.3% (90% average); Activity from 90% to
100% (94.4% average); Cry from 90% to 96.6% (94.4 average); and Consolability from 96.7%
to 100% (99.4% average). Although the Legs category had achieved consensus with
satisfactory results, it presented the lowest average of agreement when compared to the
other categories. The 30 professionals also evaluated the four instructions for the
application of the scale, according to the attributes Comprehensibility, Simplicity,
Relevance and Credibility, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The selection of the scale to be translated and submitted to cultural adaptation was
determined after various researches in the literature, involving discussions with
professionals on feasible instruments to be applied at the bedside and previous
experience of the researchers in using the FLACC. Some authors describe the FLACCr as a
tool of easy application at the bedside and discuss the accuracy and sensitivity of
other instruments for use in children with neurological impairment. The purpose is to
assist in the best possible way, this population so vulnerable<sup>(14-15)</sup>.</p><p>Is worth mentioning that, in 2011, the Royal College of Nursing <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>published a guide of good clinical practices for recognition and
evaluation of acute pain in children, which included the evaluation of children with
neurological impairment. Among the existing instruments, the FLACCr was indicated as an
appropriate tool for this population. It was emphasized the importance of the fourth
scale instruction, in which family/caregiver are asked about specific behaviors
considered warning signs for the characterization of pain. The guide also emphasized
that instruments must contain well-established validity and reliability.</p><p>This study provides a specific method. Researchers in this area recommend two
translators for validation and two translators for back-translation <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In 2003, it was proposed to simplify the
methodology, specifically in the stages of translation and back-translation <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. In this sense, some authors have simplified the
stages of translation and back-translation without compromising the quality of the final
version<sup>(18-19)</sup>.</p><p>This study followed the method described in the literature <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, with variation in the number of translators in the stages of
translation and back-translation, which did not influence in the results presented in
<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables 1</xref>, 2 and 3. As consensus, it was
considered agreement indexes greater than or equal to 80%.</p><p>The 30 professionals (experts) who participated in the assessment of cultural
equivalence of the FLACCr were from different categories (multidisciplinary), according
to the theoretical reference used<sup>(8,10)</sup>. The group was comprised by
professionals with experience in pediatrics and assistance for children with CP,
evidencing that 26 (86.6%) had experience in the area of pediatrics for over 10 years
and 73.2% had assisted children with CP daily and frequently in the previous year. It is
possible to state that, the results obtained in the cultural equivalence phase, in which
the adjustment has been completed, are consistent with evidence of satisfactory
results.</p><p>By evaluating the consensus results, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Tables
1</xref>and 2, it is observed that the Legs category achieved the lowest level of
agreement among experts, ranging from 83.3% to 93.3% and average of 90% in the
attributes evaluated, when compared to other categories, especially in the attributes
Comprehensibility, Typicity and Relevance.</p><p>Children with CP may present significant variations related to postural impairment and
movement of the limbs. According to the proposal, using the scale of pain assessment,
the evaluator should talk to family/ caregiver on behavior and conducts considered
normal for the child and warning signs of pain, representing a complementary procedure
for an accurate evaluation. In the absence of family/caregiver, the professional is
committed to observe the child more frequently, recognizing behaviors and normal
postures and warning signs <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. It was also
investigated the definition of the word "Normal" in a Portuguese dictionary <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>: it refers to what is common or usual. Thus, the
descriptors of the Legs category were maintained according to established consensus.</p><p>The 4<sup>th</sup> scale instruction had the lowest level of agreement among experts, in
the first round. The discussion among the experts was related to the comprehension of
the first sentence of the orientation: "The revised FLACC can be used for all non-verbal
children". Some experts asked whether the scale could be used only for non-verbal
children. At the end of the 3<sup>rd</sup> round, it was achieved consensus among the
experts on the applicability of the FLACCr for all non-verbal children and the
descriptors added in bold apply to children with cognitive impairment. In other words,
the author has maintained the original FLACC scale, appropriate for all non-verbal
children (without neurological impairment) and added descriptors for children with
neurological impairment on the same scale, resulting in the FLACCr.</p><p>The 4<sup>th</sup> orientation has achieved excellent levels of agreement among experts,
ranging from 96.6% to 100% and average of 98.3%, regarding pain assessment in non-verbal
children. However, the 4<sup>th</sup> instruction is clear and highlights that the
practitioner can approach the family/caregiver to discuss specific behaviors indicative
of pain, which can be added to the scale, so that other professionals have access to
this information. Researchers on the theme reinforce the importance of family
approach/caregivers of children with CP, helping in the recognition of signals of pain
and thus contributing to a better clinical outcome<sup>(20,22)</sup>.</p><p>The other categories of the scale achieved consensus greater than 80%, with some
considerations on the approximation of the professional at the bedside, in the approach
of family/caregiver.</p><p>Is worth mentioning that, it is still incipient the discussions on pain assessment in
vulnerable populations, such as children with CP. The difficulties are broad and the
lack of professionals qualified and interested in the theme generates inefficiency in
clinical practice. Some studies reveal that individuals with cognitive impairment are
particularly vulnerable to undertreatment of pain when compared to those without
cognitive impairment and able to report their pain. Moreover, some researchers have
described the lack of standards of pain assessment for this population as
vulnerable<sup>(5-6)</sup>. Consequently, it is urgent in this environment, the
instrumentalization of health professionals with tools able to standardize the practices
and generate clinical and administrative indicators. Validated instruments of pain
assessment are useful tools when used in a planned and systematic manner, particularly
in the development of the discussion within the care team on forms of assessment and
management of pain, enabling continuous process improvement <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>By following the methodological instructions, it was possible to develop, with
satisfactory results, the translation and adaptation of the FLACCr scale of pain
assessment.</p><p>The selection of the participating professionals of this first stage was essential to
achieve the stated results.</p><p>The use of scales of pain assessment is a reality in some institutions. It is
recommended the provision of properly validated scales. If the healthcare team chooses
an existing instrument in another language, it is necessary to develop the process of
translation and cultural adaptation. Therefore, it will be possible to assess pain more
reliably.</p><p>The next stage of this study is to evaluate the reliability and consistency of the
psychometric properties of the FLACCr in children with CP.</p><p>This is one of the pioneering works in Brazil focused on the pediatric population with
CP, presenting or not cognitive impairment. In addition, the study requires continuity,
so that this population is favored with adequate pain management.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Boss</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Adverse effects of pain on the nervous systems of newborns and young
