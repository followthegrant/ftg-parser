Ras-interacting protein 1 (<italic>Rasip1</italic>), a potential oncogene, is required for blood vessel formation, and recently, it has been shown that Rasip1 is widely expressed in NSCLC patients. We noticed that <italic>Rasip1</italic> promoter contains several potential RUNX1-binding sequences. However, the relationship between <italic>Rasip1</italic> and RUNX1 in NSCLC is still unknown. In this study, the potential function of RUNX1 involving in Rasip1 expression and the potential role of Rasip1 in lung cancer cells were investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Rasip1 and RUNX1 expressions were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting in NSCLC cells lines. A549 and H1299 cells were transfected with plasmids or interfering RNA (siRNA) to upregulate or downregulate the expression of Rasip1 and RUNX1. Cell motility was assessed by transwell and wound-healing assay. Location of Rasip1 and RUNX1 was detected via immunofluorescence. Meanwhile, chromatin immunoprecipitation was done using an anti-RUNX1 antibody. <italic>Rasip1 </italic>promoter was constructed, and cells were lysed for the analysis of luciferase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we showed that ectopic expression or knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in a significant increase or reduction in Rasip1 expression, respectively. RUNX1 bound directly to a specific DNA sequence within <italic>Rasip1</italic> promoter and modulated its transcription. Furthermore, silencing of Rasip1 inhibited the migration of RUNX1-overexpressing NSCLC cells through inactivation of Rac1 pathway. Moreover, we found that Rasip1 was expressed ubiquitously in NSCLC cells lines and enhanced cell migration. In addition, EGFR signaling was involved both in the expression and the subcellular localization of Rasip1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data indicated that <italic>Rasip1</italic> is regulated in part by the transcription factor RUNX1 and might be developed as a therapeutic target for NSCLC.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Rasip1</kwd><kwd>RUNX1</kwd><kwd>EGF</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>nonsmall-cell lung cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for ~80% of all lung cancer cases, and its metastasis is a major cause of high mortality.<xref rid="b1-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are an effective treatment for NSCLC patients with <italic>EGFR</italic>-activating mutations.<xref rid="b2-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, <italic>EGFR</italic> T790M and <italic>K-Ras</italic> mutations result in resistance to TKIs, which limit the effectiveness of chemotherapy.<xref rid="b3-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Therapies targeting Ras downstream effectors have been adopted in NSCLC patients.<xref rid="b4-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Thus, identification of novel Ras effectors as promising NSCLC therapeutic targets is needed.</p><p>Ras-interacting protein 1 (Rasip1), an emerging Ras effector, has been identified as the endothelial-restricted protein that contains a Ras-associating (RA) domain and a dilute (DIL) domain.<xref rid="b6-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A previous study indicated that Rasip1 is essential for vascular development and angiogenesis.

<italic>Rasip1</italic> has been found in the human lung tissue and NSCLC patients. However, the role of Rasip1 in NSCLC pathogenesis remains unknown.</p><p>Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1, also known as AML1), a member of the RUNX family, contains a conserved Runt domain that binds to core-binding factor subunit-&#x003b2; (CBF&#x003b2;) and specific DNA sequences (5&#x02032;-TGTG-GTT-3&#x02032;). RUNX1 is required for normal hematopoietic development, and the function of RUNX1 in leukemia is well established.<xref rid="b13-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It is now clear that RUNX1 plays an essential and paradoxical role in cancer development and progression. In hematopoietic diseases, RUNX1 mutations often lead to accelerated tumor development,<xref rid="b14-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> whereas some level of wild-type (WT) RUNX1 activity is still necessary to promote the leukemogenic cell growth and survival.<xref rid="b15-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<italic>RUNX1</italic> has been identified as a downregulated gene in metastasis-prone solid tumors, acting as a tumor suppressor.<xref rid="b16-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, the expression of RUNX1 is upregulated in patients with epithelial cancers and promotes tumor growth and metastasis.<xref rid="b17-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In lung adenocarcinoma, <italic>RUNX1</italic> is one of the significantly overexpressed genes and could be regarded as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis.<xref rid="b17-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b20-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Unfortunately, the RUNX1 target gene(s) in lung cancer is still unclear. To our interest, several potential RUNX1-binding sequences were found ubiquitously within <italic>Rasip1</italic> promoter. We are inspired to hypothesize that RUNX1 may act as a transcription factor of Rasip1.</p><p>In this study, we found that Rasip1 could enhance Rac1 activity and ERK phosphorylation, thereby promoting RUNX1-mediated migration in NSCLC cells lines. RUNX1 bound directly to <italic>Rasip1</italic> promoter and enhanced the expression of Rasip1. In addition, EGF could induce the plasma membrane translocation of Rasip1 and affect Rasip1 expression.

Although Rasip1 protein has been detected in A549 cell, which is well known to harbor mutation in K-Ras,<xref rid="b25-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> its protein expression profile in NSCLC cells lines has not been clarified. Therefore, we examined the expression of Rasip1 in a panel of NSCLC cells lines and found that <italic>Rasip1</italic> mRNA and protein were expressed ubiquitously, particularly in A549 and NCI-H292 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cmar-10-4537">Figure 1A</xref>). We also noted that the expression of Rasip1 in H1299 was lowest among the NSCLC cells lines. Therefore, we chose A549 and H1299 cell lines for functional study. To investigate the effect of Rasip1 on migration activity in NSCLC cells lines, the plasmid encoding Rasip1 tagged with GFP (Rasip1-GFP) was used to transfect the cells, and the migration rate of cells was detected. The cells were transfected with control vector and Rasip1-GFP plasmid, respectively. Western blotting was performed to assess the transfection efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cmar-10-4537">Figure 1B</xref>), and the overexpression of Rasip1 enhanced the migration ability of A549 and H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cmar-10-4537">Figures 1C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-cmar-10-4537">S1C</xref>). Immunofluorescence was also performed to check the transfection efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-cmar-10-4537">Figure S1A</xref>). Then, interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown Rasip1 expression in A549 and H1299 cells. siRasip1 efficiently abolished the expression of Rasip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cmar-10-4537">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-cmar-10-4537">S1B</xref>), and silencing Rasip1 dramatically impaired the migration ability of cancer cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cmar-10-4537">Figures 1F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-cmar-10-4537">S1D</xref>). In addition, we found that Rasip1 had no obvious effects on proliferation in NSCLC cells lines (data not shown).

We aligned multiple <italic>Rasip1</italic> promoter regions and identified many potential RUNX-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cmar-10-4537">Figure 2A</xref>). In mammals, there are three members of the RUNX family, including RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3. To determine which member of the RUNX family regulated the expression of Rasip1, we examined their mRNA and protein expressions in NSCLC cells lines. The expression of RUNX1 was significantly higher when compared with RUNX2 and RUNX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cmar-10-4537">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Knockdown of RUNX1 in NSCLC cells lines remarkably reduced Rasip1 expression compared with siRUNX2 and siRUNX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cmar-10-4537">Figure 2D and E</xref>). These data suggested that RUNX1 was essential for Rasip1 expression. The structure of RUNX1 common point mutations and the protein phosphorylation sites are indicated by the bars and asterisk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cmar-10-4537">Figure 2F</xref>). To rule out potential nonspecific effects of RUNX1, two RUNX1 mutant (R174Q and S249A) plasmids were constructed. The R174Q mutant could still dimerize with CBF&#x003b2;, but reduce DNA binding ability and transcription function. The S249A mutant failed to be phosphorylated, and its transcriptional activity was impaired. In A549 and H1299 cells, overexpression of RUNX1 resulted in a significant increase in Rasip1 expression, at both mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cmar-10-4537">Figure 2G</xref>) and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cmar-10-4537">Figure 2H</xref>). However, overexpression of the R174Q and S249A plasmids in NSCLC cells lines had no significant effect on Rasip1 expression, at the mRNA and protein levels. These results confirmed that RUNX1 could be a key transcription factor of Rasip1.</p></sec><sec><title>RUNX1 acts as a transcription factor of <italic>Rasip1</italic></title><p>To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which RUNX1 regulates expression of Rasip1, a 2.1 kb <italic>Rasip1</italic> promoter was constructed and its transcriptional activity was detected.

There were three putative RUNX1-binding sequences in 1,954 bp fragment. To further identify the more important RUNX1-binding sites in the fragment, four mutation promoter constructs were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-cmar-10-4537">Figure 3D</xref>). The promoter activity dropped sharply to 30% when the -1,383 bp and -950 bp sites were both mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-cmar-10-4537">Figure 3E</xref>).

The S249A mutant did not have a remarkable effect on the transcriptional activities of truncated promoters when compared with WT RUNX1. In contrast to a previous study,<xref rid="b27-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> the R174Q mutant still could enhance the transcriptional activity of three truncated promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-cmar-10-4537">Figure 3F</xref>). To explore how the R174Q mutant impairs its transcription function, immunofluorescence assay was performed. After EGF stimulation, the S249A mutant could be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, similar to WT RUNX1, whereas the R174Q mutant was still partially localized in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-cmar-10-4537">Figure 3G</xref>). These results indicated that the R174Q disrupted its nuclear localization and consequently lost its transcription activity.</p></sec><sec><title>RUNX1 promotes lung cancer cell migration in a Rasip1-dependent manner</title><p>RUNX1 regulates a list of target genes and is linked to metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma.<xref rid="b20-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b28-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> It has been reported that knockdown of RUNX1 in H1299 cell inhibited cell invasion.<xref rid="b29-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> To investigate whether Rasip1 was involved in RUNX1-mediated cell migration, RUNX1-HA plasmid and siRasip1 were cotransfected into NSCLC cells lines.

In accordance with the previous studies, EGF induced the phosphorylation of RUNX1 at Ser249. Considering that the phosphorylation of RUNX1 promoted its degradation in protein level, we analyzed expression of total RUNX1 and found that it decreased after EGF stimulation.

From the database, we noticed that Rasip1, a pan-endothelium marker, was overexpressed in NSCLC patients. However, the expression and function of Rasip1 in NSCLC cells lines are still unknown. In this study, it was identified that Rasip1 was ubiquitously expressed in NSCLC cells lines and that it promoted cell migration through activation of Rac1 and ERK pathways.

In this study, several potential RUNX-binding sites were identified within <italic>Rasip1</italic> promoter and silencing of RUNX1 suppressed the Rasip1 expression. In contrast, RUNX1 overexpression significantly enhanced the expression of Rasip1. These findings invoked the possibility that RUNX1 participates in the control of Rasip1 transcription. Indeed, our data indicated that RUNX1 bound directly to <italic>Rasip1</italic> promoter. To rule out the transcriptional activity of other RUNX family members, RUNX2 and RUNX3 were knocked down in NSCLC cells lines. The results showed that deletion of RUNX3 had a marginal effect on expression of <italic>Rasip1</italic> mRNA, but had no effect on protein expression. However, RUNX2 deletion had no influence on expression of both mRNA and protein of Rasip1. In addition, Rasip1 deletion inhibited RUNX1-mediated migration in NSCLC cells lines. Therefore, it was identified that RUNX1 had the ability to activate Rasip1 transcription in this study.</p><p>Given that RUNX1 is a weak transcription factor, its functions are reinforced through posttranslational modifications.<xref rid="b46-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="b47-cmar-10-4537" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Ser-249/Ser-266 residues of RUNX1 could be phosphorylated by ERK, which activates the interaction of RUNX1 with p300 and increased its transcriptional activity. Our data showed that expression of Rasip1 was increased, and the occupancy of RUNX1 in <italic>Rasip1</italic> promoter was enhanced by EGF stimulation. These changes were accompanied by increased RUNX1 phosphorylation after EGF treatment. However, phosphorylated RUNX1 was prone to be degraded by ubiquitin-mediated pathway. We found that the total RUNX1 and Rasip1 expression was reduced by long-term EGF stimulation. As we have noted, Rasip1 could mediate ERK phosphorylation.

We found that after EGF stimulation, unlike WT RUNX1, the R174Q mutant was still partially localized in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. Evidence was accumulating that the R174Q mutant might lose its ability to regulate Rasip1 expression through disrupting its nuclear localization.

Original colors were Rasip1, red and phalloidin, green. Accumulation of Rasip1 on the plasma membrane was indicated by the arrow. (<bold>D</bold>) The schematic diagram illustrates the complex feedback of Rasip1 expression and the cellular localization of Rasip1 after EGF treatment. Activation of ERK by EGF stimulation promotes the phosphorylation of RUNX1 at Ser249, increases its transcription activity and, hence, induces its degradation. Phosphorylated RUNX1 binds to a specific DNA sequence within <italic>Rasip1</italic> promoter and increases its transcription. In turn, Rasip1 promotes Rac1 and ERK activation, thereby increasing cell migration. Together, this system formed a positive and negative feedback loop to regulate Rasip1 expression. With the extension of EGF treatment, Rasip1 could form a complex with Ras or other protein and be recruited to the plasma membrane.
