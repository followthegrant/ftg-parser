Targeted expression of the disease-causing type I bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, ACVR1(R206H), to FAPs recapitulates the full spectrum of HO observed in FOP patients. ACVR1(R206H)-expressing FAPs, but not wild-type FAPs, activate osteogenic signaling in response to activin ligands. Conditional loss of the wild-type <italic>Acvr1</italic> allele dramatically exacerbates FAP-directed HO, suggesting that mutant and wild-type ACVR1 receptor complexes compete for activin ligands or type II BMP receptor binding partners.

Episodic heterotopic ossification (HO) flares can occur spontaneously, without any known triggers, or can result from minor bumps and bruises, immunizations, dental work, and other mild soft tissue injuries. There are currently no effective treatments to prevent or limit the progression of HO, and surgical intervention to remove heterotopic bone in FOP patients is contraindicated because of the high risk of stimulating aggressive new bone growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Common cumulative effects of these HO flares, which typically begin in early childhood, include progressive immobility resulting from ankylosing joints, spinal fusions, diminished skeletal muscle function, and shortened life-span, most frequently due to thoracic insufficiency syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Approximately 97% of FOP cases result from a single amino acid change (arginine to histidine at position 206; R206H) in the glycine&#x02013;serine-rich (GS) domain of ACVR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Most studies have indicated that the mutant receptor is hypersensitive to BMP ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Importantly, however, two recent reports demonstrated that the R206H substitution in ACVR1 is neomorphic, altering signaling specificity to activins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Whereas activins normally activate SMAD 2/3 phosphorylation and function as inhibitors of BMP signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, activin binding to ACVR1(R206H)-containing complexes elicits an osteogenic response in competent cells through SMAD 1/5/8 phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Further, activins were shown to be obligatory ligands for HO in a genetically accurate mouse model of FOP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. While cumulative evidence indicates that proximate signaling events resulting from ligand-receptor engagement are shared by many cell types (e.g. phosphorylation of downstream effectors), transcriptional outputs and developmental consequences of this signaling are likely to be highly cell type-specific. As such, a mechanistic understanding of the link between receptor signaling and HO requires identification of the relevant offending cell populations in FOP.</p><p id="Par5">Using lineage tracing and intramuscular injection of BMP2 as a mouse model for HO, we previously identified a progenitor population, lineage marked by expression of Tie2-Cre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, that is a major cell-of-origin for BMP2-induced endochondral bone formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Further analyses revealed that these so-called Tie2+ progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> are resident in the skeletal muscle interstitium but distinct from endothelial and hematopoietic cells, exhibit multipotency, and are defined by expression of the cell surface markers PDGFR&#x003b1;, and SCA1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Cumulative evidence has shown that Tie2+ progenitors are either identical to, or represent a subset of, fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, tissue-resident progenitors associated with pathogenic accumulation of fatty and fibrotic tissues in skeletal muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Differences in cell surface marker expression and lack of myogenic capacity distinguishes FAPs from satellite cells, PW1+ interstitial cells, mesoangioblasts, muscle side population cells, and other known muscle-resident progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">We developed a conditional knockin model of FOP, in which expression of <italic>Acvr1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic></sup> from the endogenous <italic>Acvr1</italic> locus is dependent on Cre-mediated recombination. Using this accurate genetic model of FOP, we demonstrate that FAPs are a major offending cell type for both injury-induced and spontaneous HO, consistent with the recent study of Dey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, who postulated that HO progenitors in FOP represent &#x0201c;reprogrammed&#x0201d; FAPs. Further, we show by lineage analysis that <italic>Acvr1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic></sup> functions cell-autonomously in FAP-directed endochondral bone formation. FAP-driven HO is strictly dependent on activin ligands and genetic analysis suggests that wild-type ACVR1 and ACVR1(R206H) compete for limiting ligand or essential signaling components, thereby dictating the extent of HO. Identifying the cells responsible for HO may facilitate development of cell-targeted therapeutic approaches for FOP, complementing ongoing drug development strategies based on inhibition of activin A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, ACVR1 kinase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and cartilage differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Conditional activating <italic>Acvr1</italic> FOP allele</title><p id="Par7">We developed a conditional knockin mouse model of FOP in which expression of <italic>Acvr1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic></sup> is Cre-dependent and under regulatory control of the endogenous <italic>Acvr1</italic> locus (<italic>Acvr1</italic><sup><italic>tnR206H</italic></sup>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), enabling cell-specific and temporal control of <italic>Acvr1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic></sup> expression.

A floxed tdTomato reporter-stop cassette driven by the constitutively active CAG promoter/enhancer was inserted into intron 4 of the mouse <italic>Acvr1</italic> gene to serve the dual purpose of stopping transcription upstream of the FOP mutation in exon 5 (resulting in a presumptive null allele) in the absence of Cre, while allowing identification of unrecombined cells by red fluorescence.

In all cases, skeletal muscle exhibited robust, injury-induced HO (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>). Second, we developed a transplantation assay to test the osteogenic activity of <italic>Acvr1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic></sup>-expressing FAPs and to verify that Tie2-lineage-labeled FAPs reside in native muscle tissue.

In the present report, we developed a physiologically relevant conditional expression allele of <italic>Acvr1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic></sup> and used Cre/lox lineage tracing methods to interrogate HO progenitors in FOP. We demonstrated that FAPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> are a major contributor to both heterotopic cartilage and bone. We further showed that FAPs mediate both injury-induced and spontaneous disease, and cause HO in essentially all major anatomical sites described for FOP patients, including appendicular and back musculature, tendons/ligaments, major joints, and jaw. While the present experiments do not address whether FAPs are the only progenitor population with the capacity to drive HO, FAPs can explain the full repertoire of HO in FOP.</p><p id="Par25">Using Cre/lox lineage-tracing methods similar to those of the present study, Dey et al. concluded that two distinct, non-overlapping tissue-resident progenitor cell populations are responsible for the diverse HO phenotypes in FOP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

Notably, however, PDGFR&#x003b1;+ cells were shown to be a small subfraction of each lineage-labeled cell pool, and the PDGFR&#x003b1;+ subfractions exhibited significantly increased chondrogenic and osteogenic activity in culture compared to PDGFR&#x003b1;-negative subfractions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

In this regard, possible differences in recombination efficiency could have contributed to the Cre-specific phenotypes reported; we have observed a correlation between recombination efficiency of the <italic>Acvr1</italic><sup><italic>tnR206H</italic></sup> allele and the penetrance, severity, and anatomical location of spontaneous HO.</p><p id="Par26">Understanding FOP pathogenesis will require detailed knowledge of the cell populations that drive the initiation, growth, and remodeling of HO. Although it is clear that the initiation of HO is driven by <italic>Acvr1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic>/+</sup> progenitors, there is some disagreement concerning the degree to which wild-type cells can contribute to skeletal tissues of HO lesions. Dey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> reported that Scx-Cre and Mx1-Cre lineage-labeled populations gave rise to heterotopic cartilage, but not heterotopic bone, implying cell non-autonomous functions of the mutant receptor.

Similarly, following transplantation of <italic>Acvr1</italic><sup><italic>R206H/+</italic></sup> FAPs into SCID muscle, apparent host cells accounted for only a small percentage (~5%) of definitive cartilage and bone.

To introduce the R206H mutation, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a plasmid harboring the AflII-XhoI fragment containing exon 5 with the following oligomers; 5&#x02032;-GTACAGAGAACGGTGGCcCatCAGATAACCCTGTTGGAG-3&#x02032;and 5&#x02032;-CTCCAACAGGGTTATCTGatGgGCCACCGTTCTCTGTAC-3&#x02032; (the letters shown in lowercase are mutated nucleotides). To generate the final targeting vector, DFOP-LTN, wild-type exon 5 was replaced with the mutated exon and the floxed CT2ANpA fragment was inserted into the NdeI site in intron 4 of pPGKDTA_mACVR1.
