A combination of genetic and targeted metabolomics approach was used to understand the network properties of phenylpropanoid secondary metabolism pathways. A novel quercetin oxidoreductase, QuoA, from <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic>, which converts quercetin to naringenin, thus effectively reversing the biosynthesis of quercetin through a <italic>de novo</italic> pathway, was expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. <italic>QuoA</italic> transgenic lines selected for low, medium, and high expression levels of <italic>QuoA</italic> RNA had corresponding levels of QuoA activity and hypocotyl coloration resulting from increased anthocyanin accumulation. Stems of all three <italic>QuoA</italic> lines had increased tensile strength resulting from increased lignification. Sixteen metabolic intermediates from anthocyanin, lignin, and shikimate pathways had increased accumulation, of which 11 paralleled <italic>QuoA</italic> expression levels in the transgenic lines. The concomitant upregulation of the above pathways was explained by a significant downregulation of the phenolamide pathway and its precursor, spermidine. In a <italic>tt6</italic> mutant line, lignifications as well as levels of the lignin pathway metabolites were much lower than those of <italic>QuoA</italic> transgenic lines. Unlike <italic>QuoA</italic> lines, phenolamides and spermidine were not affected in the <italic>tt6</italic> line. Taken together, these results suggest that phenolamide pathway plays a major role in directing metabolic intermediates into the lignin pathway. Metabolic perturbations were accompanied by downregulation of five genes associated with branch-point enzymes and upregulation of their corresponding products. These results suggest that gene&#x02013;metabolite pairs are likely to be co-ordinately regulated at critical branch points. Thus, these perturbations by a gain-of-function approach have uncovered novel properties of the phenylpropanoid metabolic network.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>Anthocyanins</kwd><kwd>auxotrophic mutant</kwd><kwd>branch points</kwd><kwd>flavonoids</kwd><kwd>lignin pathway</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria</kwd><kwd>PGPR</kwd><kwd><italic>tt6</italic>.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Perturbations can be caused in metabolic networks to uncover relationships that exist between different parts of the networks. While physiological or environmental perturbations can be used to study such relationships, they can affect different points in multiple pathways. Genetic approaches, on the other hand, have been used to cause perturbations of specific steps in targeted metabolic pathways. These perturbations can be induced via loss-of-function approaches such as gene deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Franke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) or silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Besseau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In comparison with these approaches, expression of plant or bacterial enzymes in transgenic plants provides a means for perturbing metabolic pathways by gain-of-function methods. This approach has been effective in introducing new functions to increase the accumulation of desired compounds or to reroute metabolites. Expression of bacterial enoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase, for example, results in rerouting in the phenylpropanoid pathway and leads to depletion of phenolics and accumulation of vanillic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">Mayer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). During perturbation of the isoprenoid pathway by the expression of a bacterial gene encoding 1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase in transgenic potato tubers, metabolic channelling of <italic>trans</italic>-zeatin riboside and carotenoids increases 2-fold and levels of phytoene increase 6- to 7-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">Morris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Phenylpropanoids are secondary metabolites derived from phenylalanine. They play a critical role in signalling and plant defence against abiotic or biotic stresses. Phenylpropanoid-based polymers in plants, such as lignin, suberin, or condensed tannins, contribute to the physical stability and robustness towards environmental damages from drought or wounding. Metabolic intermediates from the upper phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway serve as starting point for multiple pathways connected by branches to form flavonoids, anthocyanins, proanthocyanins, lignins, and phenolamides. Together, all these pathways constitute the phenylpropanoid metabolic network. A plethora of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic mutants have facilitated the identification and functional characterization of genes and enzymes of the phenylpropanoid metabolic network. Among these, several enzymes of the flavonoid pathway, such as chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone-flavanone isomerase (CHI), and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), form a complex in order to regulate the partitioning of intermediates among competing pathways and determine the intracellular deposition of end-products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Burbulis and Winkel-Shirley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">Rasmussen and Dixon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0036">Winkel, 2004</xref>). These enzyme complexes play an important role in channelling of intermediates, limiting their diffusion into the surrounding milieu, which determines metabolic network properties under different conditions. Hence, keeping such complexes intact, while perturbing metabolic pathways in order to estimate network behaviour, would be an ideal approach. Given the highly complex nature of phenylpropanoid metabolic network and the importance of its constituent metabolites, it makes an ideal target to decipher the relationships among the pathways of this network.</p><p content-type="indent">We previously reported a <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> strain PML2 capable of utilizing quercetin as a sole carbon source for growth and elucidated a catabolic pathway for quercetin degradation in this strain using a comparative metabolomics approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">Pillai and Swarup, 2002</xref>). The first step in this pathway is the conversion of quercetin to naringenin involving dehydroxylation at two sites. The corresponding gene has been designated <italic>QuoA</italic>. As phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in plants involves the formation of quercetin from naringenin, we envisaged that <italic>QuoA</italic> expression in plants would provide us with a genetic tool to &#x02018;reverse&#x02019; this biosynthetic step using a gain-of-function approach and would enable us to monitor the perturbational effects in the metabolic networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Phenylpropanoid metabolic network map in <italic>Arabidopsis.</italic> PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumaroyl-coenzyme A ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone-flavanone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3&#x02032;H, flavonoid 3&#x02032;-mono-oxygenase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; QuoA, quercetin oxidoreductase; FLS, flavonol synthase; F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H, flavonoid 3&#x02032;5&#x02032;-hydroxylase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; BAN, banyuls; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; FGT, flavonoid glycosyl transferase; C3H, coumarate-3-hydroxylase; F5H, ferulate-5-hydroxylase; CCR1, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1; OMT1, flavonol 3&#x02032;-<italic>o</italic>-methyltransferase; SGT, sinapate-1-glucosyltransferase; SNG1, sinapoylglucose:malate sinapoyltransferase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl CoA <italic>o</italic>-methyltransferase; UFGT, UDP-flavonol glucose transferase; SHT, spermidine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; bHLH, basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix; WDR, WD-repeat protein with WRKY domains; TT, transparent testa; TTG1, transparent testa glabra 1.

The lack of an increase in lignins in the F3H mutant line <italic>tt6</italic> in this study is also consistent with the previous report. In contrast, there is very little known about the reciprocal effects of direct perturbation of the flavonoid pathway on the lignin pathway branch. Simultaneous increases in levels of both anthocyanins and lignins by <italic>QuoA-</italic>mediated perturbation clearly establishes the reciprocal effects of perturbation of flavonoids on the lignin pathway. These relationships between the flavonoid and lignin pathways are likely to differ in various parts of the plant due to their tissue specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Grotewold, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0037">Yazaki, 2005</xref>) and by the local pools of metabolites being affected by their long-distance transport (Buer <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">2008</xref>). This effect on lignins is also biologically relevant, as shown by the increased stem stiffness of <italic>QuoA</italic> transgenic lines.</p><p content-type="indent">One possible explanation of the difference in the perturbational effects between the gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches here is that intact flavonoid enzyme complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Burbulis and Winkel-Shirley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">Saslowsky and Winkel-Shirley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Conrado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) are required for increased channelling of metabolites from flavonoid to lignin pathways. It is quite likely that changes in the levels of anthocyanin intermediates and increases in lignification have resulted from the QuoA gain-of-function approach, where such enzyme complexes would be intact. This raises a possibility whether some of the key enzymes of the lignin pathways are part of the flavonoid metabolic complexes, which can be tested in future.</p><p content-type="indent">It is intriguing that <italic>QuoA</italic>-mediated perturbation led to upregulation of both lignin and anthocyanin pathways, while the phenylpropanoid pathway above coumaroyl-CoA was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Levels of the two members of the upper phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine and cinnamate, were not affected by QuoA perturbation. Thus, this raises the question of which pathway contributes towards simultaneous upregulation of the lignin and anthocyanin pathways? There are no input pathways below the perturbed step in the flavonoid pathway. Hence, the increase in the anthocyanins can only be explained as a result of accumulation of metabolic intermediates from the flavonoid pathway, which then leads to synthesis of anthocyanins. In the case of the lignin pathway, three other input pathways are likely contributors towards its increased levels. These are the upper phenylpropanoid pathway, malonyl-CoA from the Krebs cycle, and the phenolamide pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Matsuno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">Vogt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">Bassard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Kanehisa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Contributions by the first two pathways cannot explain the increased levels of metabolic intermediates of the lignin pathway, as these were unaffected by the QuoA-induced perturbation. The phenolamide pathway, on the other hand, seems to be a likely candidate for increased levels of metabolites in the lignin pathway. The low, medium, and high expression lines of <italic>QuoA</italic> showed a corresponding effect on the overall reduction of the seven intermediates from the phenolamide pathway. The only exception was tricoumaroyl spermidine, which is associated with the first step in the phenylpropanoid pathway. The F3H mutant <italic>tt6</italic>, which has no increase in lignification, also did not have any perturbational effect on the phenolamide pathway. Lignin upregulation from <italic>QuoA</italic> perturbation, therefore, seems to occur at the expense of phenolamide pathway intermediates. Our study therefore suggests a strong relationship between the lignin and phenolamide pathway and opens up an additional approach to manipulate lignification and stem stiffness characteristics, especially of herbaceous plants.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F6" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>Summary of perturbational effect metabolite and gene expression perturbation resulting from <italic>QuoA</italic> expression.

Only metabolic pathways belonging to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are shown (based on TAIR, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/">http://www.arabidopsis.org/</uri>, 10 September 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Matsuno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; Umezawa, 2009). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> legend for abbreviations. The fold changes are represented as: &#x0003e;2, red; &#x0003c; 2, green; &#x0003c;1.3, purple. All metabolites/genes represented in black fonts did not show changes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="exbotj_ert310_f0006"/></fig><p content-type="indent">Our data strongly suggest that the genes and metabolites associated with branch points of pathways have a strong association. Perturbation of metabolite levels was shown here to be associated with changes in the expression levels of genes encoding branch-point enzymes. A complete survey of 17 genes from the four branched pathways showed changes in expression of five genes, all of which were associated with branch points. In each case, the associated products encoded by these genes were also perturbed. The direction of these changes were similar in all cases: while all branch-point genes were downregulated, their corresponding products were upregulated.</p><p content-type="indent">Simultaneous analysis of RNA and metabolite levels has uncovered gene&#x02013;metabolite relationships in several plant models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Holtorf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">Stitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Altered expression levels of cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase showed the existence of a feedback loop at the entry point into the phenylpropanoid pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Blount <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In the case of the flavonoid pathway, coumaroyl-CoA has been shown to affect the expression of <italic>PAL</italic>. More recently, flavonoid glycosylation has been shown to be associated with changes in the expression levels of <italic>PAL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038">Yin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, this metabolite-to-gene-expression regulation seems to be a more widespread phenomenon in the overall phenylpropanoid network, as shown here. The biochemical mechanism of control of the gene&#x02013;metabolite pairs at the branch points is not yet known. Both possibilities remain open: that either there is coordinated control of gene&#x02013;metabolite pairs via a common mechanism or that there are local regulatory controls at each branch point arising from the common primary perturbational effect. The increase in lignin content with a co-ordinated decrease in the expression of lignin pathway genes also suggests a possible feedback mechanism from lignin or its precursors on gene expression. It will be interesting to investigate the regulatory mechanisms at such branch points and pathways in the metabolic networks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s19"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>
