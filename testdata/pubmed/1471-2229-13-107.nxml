However, some pathogens still manage to invade plants and impair growth and productivity. Previous studies have revealed several key regulators of defense responses, and efforts have been made to use this information to develop disease resistant crop plants. These efforts are often hampered by the complexity of defense signaling pathways. To further elucidate the complexity of defense responses, we screened a population of T-DNA mutants in Colombia-0 background that displayed altered defense responses to virulent <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000 (<italic>Pst</italic> DC3000).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated that the Arabidopsis <italic>Purple Acid Phosphatse5</italic> (<italic>PAP5</italic>) gene, induced under prolonged phosphate (Pi) starvation, is required for maintaining basal resistance to certain pathogens. The expression of <italic>PAP5</italic> was distinctly induced only under prolonged Pi starvation and during the early stage of <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 infection (6&#x000a0;h.p.i). T-DNA tagged mutant <italic>pap5</italic> displayed enhanced susceptibility to the virulent bacterial pathogen <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000. The <italic>pap5</italic> mutation greatly reduced the expression of pathogen inducible gene <italic>PR1</italic> compared to wild-type plants.

To defend against pathogens, plants have evolved an innate immune system to recognize and limit infection (reviewed in
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Activation of defense responses involves the initial recognition of pathogens by chemical cues (elicitors) or Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) that include bacterial lipopolysaccharides, flagellin, fungal chitin and ergosterol
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Recognition of PAMP by specific Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) in the plasma membrane leads to activation of defense responses in both non-host and basal disease resistance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Activation of PRRs subsequently induces the calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways leading to rapid ion fluxes, followed by transcriptional activation of defense responsive genes and synthesis of antimicrobial compounds to restrict infection
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Primarily, regulation of plant defense responses is mediated through the phytohormones salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, in recent years other phytohormones including abscisic acid (ABA), auxins, gibberellins (GA), cytokines (CK) and brassinosteriods (BR) have been shown to mediate specific plant defense responses (reviewed in
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). As plants are exposed to an array of pathogens with diverse infection strategies, activation of appropriate, pathogen-specific defense responses is vital for plant growth and productivity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Plant pathogens are classified as biotrophs, necrotrophs or hemi-biotrophs based on their life style and infection strategy. Biotrophic pathogens live as obligate parasites that derive nutrients from living host tissues, while necrotrophs feed on dead tissues. Hemi-biotrophs behave as both biotroph and necrotroph depending on the stage of their life cycle
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Defense against biotrophs involves SA-dependent responses whereas necrotroph resistance is SA-independent relaying primarily on JA/ET-dependent pathways
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The SA signaling pathway is associated with transcriptional activation of pathogenesis related (PR) genes and the establishment of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) to provide enhanced, long lasting resistance to secondary infections
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. By contrast, JA/ET signaling pathways are associated with resistance against necrotrophic pathogens and rhizobacteria-mediated induced systemic resistance (ISR), and are not typically associated with PR gene expression
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, there are complex signaling and cross talk between the SA-dependent and SA-independent pathways
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Genetic screening of mutant plant populations has proved very useful for the functional analysis of defense responses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In Arabidopsis, genetic screening has revealed a large number of mutants that exhibit altered responses to SA, JA and/or ET and are more susceptible to virulent pathogens
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Identification and characterization of enhanced disease susceptibility (<italic>eds</italic>) mutants, including a series of phytoalexin deficient (<italic>pad</italic>) mutants, have helped to elucidate a number of defense signaling pathways involved in both basal and induced defense responses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Purple Acid Phosphatases (PAPs) belong to a family of binuclear metalloenzymes that exhibit diverse biological functions in plants, animals and bacterial species
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. While the predominant role of PAPs in plants is regulation of Pi uptake, PAPs also contribute to other biological functions including peroxidation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], ascorbate recycling
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], mediation of salt tolerance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and regulation of cell wall carbohydrate biosynthesis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Plant PAPs share significant sequence similarity with mammalian tartarate-resistant acid phosphatases (TRAPs), which are involved in bone resorption
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], iron transport
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and also in the generation of reactive oxygen species for microbial killing
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In humans, TRAP expression is restricted to activated macrophages where it aids in the generation of free radicals to enhance microbial killing
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Although numerous reports have emphasized the importance of PAPs in Pi acquisition, it has been difficult to assign a general physiological role to PAPs due to their diversity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The Arabidopsis genome contains 29 <italic>PAP</italic> encoding genes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Changes in <italic>PAP</italic> gene expression differs in response to Pi concentration where PAP11 and PAP12 are transcriptionally induced while PAP7-PAP10 and <italic>PAP13</italic> remain unchanged in response to Pi deprivation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Kaffarnik and colleagues first reported the accumulation of PAP10 and a decrease in the abundance of PAP14 in the secretome of Arabidopsis cell culture following <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection, suggesting a role for PAPs in the host defense response
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Recently, Li <italic>et al</italic>., (2012) also provided the evidence that some soybean PAPs (GmPAPs) are involved in symbiosis under Pi starved conditions. PAPs carry predicted signal peptides and presumably are secreted, however the biological function of these proteins in the extracellular space is unknown
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Here we provide evidence that the Arabidopsis <italic>PAP5</italic> is involved in basal resistance against certain plant pathogens. <italic>PAP5</italic> mutant plants exhibited enhanced susceptibility to virulent isolate of <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000. In addition, expression of defense related genes following <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 infection were impaired in <italic>pap5</italic> plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of mutants exhibiting altered defense responses</title><p>One thousand two hundred unique <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (ecotype Col-0) T-DNA insertion lines were spray inoculated with the virulent isolate of <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000 (<italic>Pst</italic> DC3000) and monitored for altered responses to the pathogen. Mutants exhibiting extensive chlorosis in comparison to wild-type plants, scored by visual examination, were designated as susceptible.

A total of 24&#x000a0;T-DNA insertion lines exhibited either altered disease susceptibility, root colonization or both compared to wild-type plants (data not shown). The mutant line salk_126152C (<italic>pap5-1</italic>), which exhibited enhanced susceptibility to <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 with extensive chlorosis on leaf tissues, was selected for further analysis (Figure&#x000a0;

In previous studies <italic>PAP5</italic> transcripts were not detectable under phosphate starvation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Unlike <italic>PAP12</italic> and <italic>PAP26, PAP5</italic> is not abundantly expressed under normal phosphate starvation conditions. Our results revealed that <italic>PAP5</italic> is expressed only under prolonged Pi starvation (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). Mutation in <italic>PAP26</italic> has been shown to impair growth and increase anthocyanin accumulation in response to Pi starvation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Despite the loss of <italic>PAP5</italic> expression, mutant plants did not show discrete phenotypic differences from that of wild-type plants. Both wild-type and <italic>pap5-1</italic> plants exhibited an increased root/shoot ratio under Pi starvation (data not shown). This finding also indicates that <italic>PAP5</italic> does not play a major role in Pi acquisition and is more likely to regulate other functions. The Arabidopsis genome contains 29 <italic>PAP</italic> encoding genes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and this may lead to functional redundancy. This study suggests that the loss of <italic>PAP5</italic> resulted in impairment of defense responsive genes in response to <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 infection. Further, it appears that other <italic>PAP</italic> genes does not compensate for the loss of <italic>PAP5</italic> function in response to pathogen attack<italic>.</italic></p><p>Genetic analyses of Arabidopsis mutants have revealed many key regulatory genes in plant defense responses. Enhanced disease susceptibility mutants including <italic>eds5</italic>, <italic>pad4</italic>, <italic>npr1</italic> and <italic>sid2</italic> have previously been reported to exhibit enhanced susceptibility and compromised defense responses to both virulent and avirulent isolates of <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It is also evident that most bacterial pathogens including <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 are inoculated by pressure-infiltration to study plant-bacterial interactions. Although pressure-infiltration is the most commonly used inoculation method, these inoculation procedures may prevent early innate immune responses such as flagellin perception (FLS2 mediated resistance)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and stomatal closure
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Also FLS2 mediated resistance was effective only when <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 was sprayed on the leaf surface and not when bacteria was infiltrated in to leaves
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Hence, to mimic natural infection and to focus on the early defense responses we sprayed plants with suspension of <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 containing 10<sup>8</sup> c.f.u ml<sup>&#x02013;l</sup>. We also observed that plants sprayed with 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml<sup>-l</sup> developed reduced symptoms compared to plants sprayed with 10<sup>8</sup> cells (data not shown).

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The <italic>PR1</italic> transcripts at 48&#x000a0;h.p.i were slightly lower compared to wild-type (Figure&#x000a0;

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. We observed that <italic>PAP5</italic> was strongly induced in the early stages of infection (6&#x000a0;h.p.i). This induction was transient as no difference was observed at 24 and 48&#x000a0;h.p.i. One possible explanation of this observation is that the level of PAP5 induced during the early stages (6&#x000a0;h.p.i) of infection could be sufficient to dephosphorylate signaling proteins required for activation of defense responses downstream of <italic>PAP5</italic>. Thus, it is also possible that <italic>PAP5</italic> might be involved in early responses to pathogens similar to glutotione s-transferse (<italic>GST6</italic>) and glucosyltransferase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Moreover, members of the PAP family have been known to exhibit peroxidase activity in addition to Pi acquisition and recycling
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Although, the role of <italic>PAP5</italic> with regard to peroxidase activity has not been established, we hypothesize that the <italic>PAP5</italic> might mediate generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 infection. ROS was initially proposed to be mediate plant defense response especially, during an incompatible interaction
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Virulent pathogens, capable of evading pathogen recognition are also known to induce ROS production at latter stages of infection to lower levels

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. These results also suggest that defense responsive genes other than <italic>PR1</italic> and <italic>PDF1.2</italic> are required to mount wild-type levels of resistance against <italic>B. cinerea</italic>.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Since <italic>pap5-1</italic> plants induced comparable levels of <italic>PR1</italic> to wild-type plants following <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection, it is possible that the effect of <italic>PAP5</italic> is restricted to SA derived via <italic>ICS</italic> and not via <italic>PAL</italic>.</p><p>Application of BTH and MJ in wild-type and <italic>pap5</italic> plants induced expression of <italic>PR1</italic> and <italic>PDF1.2,</italic> respectively (Figure&#x000a0;

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A). This slight increase in <italic>PR1</italic> expression and its significance is unclear. Similarly, application of SA on <italic>pad4</italic> plants showed a slight increase in <italic>PR1</italic> expression
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. All mammalian PAPs characterized exist as monomers of ~35&#x000a0;kDa (Low Molecular Weight, LMW), while plants encode a relatively large family of High Molecular Weight (HMW) homodimeric and oligomeric PAPs (~45-74&#x000a0;kDa).
