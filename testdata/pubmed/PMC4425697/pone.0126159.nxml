Besides escaping the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy, they also bypass the pro-immunogenic effects induced by anticancer drugs: indeed they are not well recognized by host dendritic cells and do not elicit a durable anti-tumor immunity. It has not yet been investigated whether multidrug resistant cells have a different ability to induce immunosuppression than chemosensitive ones. We addressed this issue in human and murine chemosensitive and multidrug resistant cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>We found that the activity and expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan into the immunosuppressive metabolite kynurenine, was higher in all the multidrug resistant cells analyzed and that IDO1 inhibition reduced the growth of drug-resistant tumors in immunocompetent animals. In chemoresistant cells the basal activity of JAK1/STAT1 and JAK1/STAT3 signaling was higher, the STAT3 inhibitor PIAS3 was down-regulated, and the autocrine production of STAT3-target and IDO1-inducers cytokines IL-6, IL-4, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-13, TNF-&#x003b1; and CD40L, was increased. The disruption of the JAK/STAT signaling lowered the IDO1 activity and reversed the kynurenine-induced pro-immunosuppressive effects, as revealed by the restored proliferation of T-lymphocytes in STAT-silenced chemoresistant cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our work shows that multidrug resistant cells have a stronger immunosuppressive attitude than chemosensitive cells, due to the constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT/IDO1 axis, thus resulting chemo- and immune-evasive.

Chemoresistance, in particular the simultaneous resistance towards different chemotherapeutic agents known as multidrug resistance (MDR), is one of the biggest problems encountered by chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. MDR can be present at the diagnosis or induced by the selective pressure of chemotherapy; it often relies on the overexpression of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters responsible for the anticancer drug efflux, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp), MDR related proteins (MRPs) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Together, they efflux both classical chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. anthracyclines, taxanes, Vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, topotecan, methotrexate) and new targeted drugs (e.g. imatinib, dasatinib, lapatinib, gefitinib, sorafenib, erlotinib), limiting their cytotoxic effects [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Specific chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracyclines and oxaliplatin, induce also pro-immunogenic effects, by inducing the translocation on the plasma membrane of specific &#x0201c;eat me&#x0201d; signals, like the chaperon calreticulin, which triggers the tumor cell phagocytosis and the subsequent activation of antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This mechanism does not operate in cells overexpressing Pgp [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which result at the same time chemo- and immune-resistant.</p><p>Moreover, tumor cells may evade the host immunosurveillance by suppressing the activity of the host immune system. A plethora of mechanisms mediate the tumor-induced immunosuppression, including: changes in tumor surface antigens; release of immunosuppressive cytokines in the tumor microenvironment; expansion of T-helper 2 lymphocytes, T-regulatory (Treg) cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells and type 2-tumor associated macrophages, which favor the tumor growth and impair the activity of anti-tumor populations, such as T-helper 1 lymphocytes, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes, type 1-tumor associated macrophages, natural killer cells [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>One of the strongest mediators of the tumor-induced immunosuppression is kynurenine, the product of tryptophan catabolism via tryptophan dioxygenase (TDO) [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase enzymes (IDO1 and IDO2) [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which are induced by interferon- &#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126159.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], nitric oxide (NO) [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and iron [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid for the proliferation and survival of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes; moreover the increased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio severely compromises the efficiency of the host cellular immunity, because kynurenine inhibits the activation of T-lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126159.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. IDO1 is expressed in tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and in tumor stromal cells [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and it has been found constitutively expressed or up-regulated in several tumor cells [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126159.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An increased serum kynurenine/tryptophan ratio has been correlated to a faster progression of lung cancer [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and the IDO positivity in tumor samples is usually associated with a poor clinical prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. IDO1 over-expression supports tumor growth and progression of lung cancers [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], leading to hypothesize that kynurenine, besides its immunosuppressive effects, may directly enhance the tumor development.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that multidrug resistant cells are resistant to the immunogenic death operated by dendritic cells-mediated phagocytosis [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It has not been investigated whether multidrug resistant cells differ from chemosensitive ones also for the ability to induce immunosuppression: we found that multidrug resistant cells had a basally higher production of the immunosuppressive metabolite kynurenine than chemosensitive cells and we investigated the molecular basis of this phenotype.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Chemicals</title><p>The plasticware for cell cultures was from Falcon (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

In line with these results, the percentages of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells recovered at the end of the co-incubation of PBMC with tumor cells was lower with A549/dx cells than with A549 cells, but the silencing of STAT1 and STAT3 significantly increased it (<xref rid="pone.0126159.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>).

These data suggest that the high kynurenine levels can be responsible for the reduced expansion of CD3<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes induced by multidrug resistant cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work we report for the first time that kynurenine production was higher in multidrug resistant than in chemosensitive cancer cells, independently from the type of chemoresistance (i.e. chemotherapy-induced or constitutive MDR) and the type of tumor. According to the expression pattern of IDO1, IDO2 and TDO in chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell lines, the higher synthesis of kynurenine in resistant cells was mainly due to the higher amount of IDO1.</p><p>It has been recently reported that a high intratumor amount of IDO1 favors the growth of lung cancers [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This observation is in keeping with our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, where the chemoresistant tumors expressing high levels of IDO1 grew faster than the chemosensitive counterparts with low levels of the enzyme. The pharmacological inhibition of IDO1 with 5-Br-brassinin significantly reduced the growth of chemoresistant tumors in immunocompetent animals, but not in immunodeficient mice. This result, which was in agreement with previous observations [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], led to the hypothesis that the antitumor effects of IDO1 inhibition require an active immune system and are mediated by the reduction of immunosuppressive cells and/or by the restoration of immune cells active against multidrug resistant tumors.</p><p>To clarify the molecular mechanisms at the basis of IDO1 overexpression in multidrug resistant cells, we focused on the model of non small cell lung cancer A549 and A549/dx cells, where the difference of IDO1 expression between sensitive and resistant cells was particularly pronounced. A recent study demonstrated that the serum kynurenine/tryptophan ratio is higher in patients affected by non small cell lung cancer compared with healthy controls and that such difference was further increased by radio-chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Differently from what it was observed in patients, we did not detect any increase of kynurenine production in cells exposed to one dose of chemotherapeutic drugs. We cannot exclude however that repeated exposures to chemotherapeutic agents, as it occurs in patients, might further increase the kynurenine synthesis also in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model.</p><p>The most striking difference between chemosensitive and multidrug resistant cells was the constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT axis in resistant cells. Although the expression of JAK1, a documented activator of STAT1 and STAT3 [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126159.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], was not different, the multidrug resistant cells showed a higher basal amount of STAT1 and STAT3, and of the activated tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of JAK1, STAT1 and STAT3. The phosphorylation on tyrosine of STATs is necessary for their homodimerization and translocation into the nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]: indeed nuclear phospho(Tyr701)-STAT1 and phospho(Tyr705)-STAT3, which were undetectable in chemosensitive cells, were abundant in multidrug resistant ones. These results suggest that both the increased transcription of STAT1 and STAT3, as revealed by the PCR array analysis, and the increased activity of the JAK/STAT axis, as indicated by the higher phosphorylation of STAT1/3, contribute to the increased activation of STATs in multidrug resistant cells and to the transcriptional activation of <italic>IDO1</italic> gene. Whereas the expression of the STAT1 inhibitor PIAS1 was equal in A549 and A549/dx cells, the amount of the STAT3 inhibitor PIAS3 was lower in A549/dx cells. According to this pattern, STAT3 more than STAT1 should have the higher transcriptional activity in our multidrug resistant cells. Indeed we found several STAT3-target genes significantly up-regulated in A549/dx cells; moreover, the selective silencing of STAT1 or STAT3 demonstrated that both factors were involved in <italic>IDO1</italic> transcription in multidrug resistant cells, but STAT3 had a slightly prominent role in this process.</p><p>The STAT1 and STAT3 activity is promoted by IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], a known IDO1 inducer [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In A549/dx cells the exogenous IFN-&#x003b3; elicited a strong induction of IDO1, more evident than in A549 cells. This result suggests that the IFN-&#x003b3;-dependent signaling was more promptly activated in multidrug resistant than in chemosensitive cells: this may be explained by the higher activity of JAK/STAT axis in A549/dx cells. Interestingly, we detected an autocrine production of IFN-&#x003b3;, higher in A549/dx than in A549 cells: although the amount of IFN-&#x003b3; was significantly lower than the one produced by activated immune system cells [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], it might be sufficient to induce the transcription of <italic>IDO1</italic> in multidrug resistant cells, owing to their constitutively activated JAK/STAT axis. Therefore, an autocrine IFN-&#x003b3;/JAK/STAT loop may be the driving force for the induction of IDO1 in A549/dx cells. The maximal induction of IDO1, however, is often produced by the cooperation of IFN-&#x003b3; with other cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]: IL-6, IL-4, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-13, TNF-&#x003b1; and CD40L are documented inducers of IDO1, alone or together with IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. According to the PCR array analysis, these cytokines were at least two-fold up-regulated in A549/dx cells, where they may contribute to the transcription of IDO. All the above-mentioned cytokines are STAT3-target genes; moreover, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-13 activate the JAK1/STAT3 axis with a feed-forward mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We might speculate that the higher basal production of these cytokines feeds multiple autocrine &#x0201c;cytokine/JAK/STAT3&#x0201d; loops, which sustain the transcription of <italic>IDO1</italic> in multidrug resistant cells.</p><p>The expression of IDO1 in non small cell lung cancer cells has been already related to the constitutive activation of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling: kynurenine activates the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor, that in turn increases the autocrine synthesis of IL-6 and the subsequent activation of STAT3 [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although in this work it has not been investigated whether the cells were chemosensitive or chemoresistant, it is conceivable that a similar loop works in A549/dx cells. On the other hand, with a feedback mechanism, IL-6 increases the STAT3-signaling inhibitor protein SOCS3, which induces the proteasomal degradation of IDO1 [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. <italic>SOCS3</italic> mRNA was indeed up-regulated in A549/dx cells: this up-regulation may perhaps buffer the effect of IL-6 on STAT3 activity and <italic>IDO1</italic> transcription, limiting the maximal activation of the enzyme. We believe that the concomitant production of multiple cytokines, more than a single cytokine, contributes to the activation of STAT3 and IDO1 in A549/dx cells.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, only indirect evidences have correlated the activity of STAT3 and IDO1 to the chemoresistance. For instance, the disruption of the STAT3 signaling has reduced tumor proliferation and angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and has sensitized resistant breast cancer cells to doxorubicin [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A high production of kynurenine has been associated with resistance to olaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, gamma radiations and cisplatin [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. On the other hand, the IDO1 inhibitor methyl-DL-tryptophan has increased the efficacy of paclitaxel in endometrial cancer xenografts [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], suggesting that the inhibition of IDO1 may improve the chemosensitivity. Our assays suggest an additional benefit of inhibiting the STAT3/IDO1 axis in resistant cells, i.e. the restoration of a significant expansion of T-lymphocytes that would be otherwise suppressed in the presence of multidrug resistant tumor cells.</p><p>Our work is the first demonstration that multidrug resistant cells have a higher endogenous production of kynurenine, sustained by the constitutive activation of a &#x0201c;cytokine/JAK/STAT3/IDO1&#x0201d; axis. Such phenotype is paralleled by the reduced expansion of the global population of T-lymphocytes, a feature that might favor the immune-evasion of multidrug resistant cells. Some pharmacological inhibitors of IDO1 [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and the vaccination against IDO1 [<xref rid="pone.0126159.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] are under evaluation in immunotherapy protocols to contrast the development of tumors refractory to the conventional therapies. In our multidrug resistant cells IDO1, although over-expressed, was sensitive to classical inhibitors such as methyl-DL-tryptophan and 5-Br-brassinin. This observation may be useful in a translational perspective and may represent a strong indication for the inclusion of IDO1 inhibitors in chemo-immunotherapy protocols against chemoresistant cancers, in order to limit the immunosuppressive attitude of these tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126159.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Expression of ABC transporters in chemosensitive and multidrug resistant cells.</title><p>Human chemosensitive lung cancer A549 cells and chemoresistant A549/dx cells, human chemosensitive colon cancer HT29 cells and chemoresistant HT29/dx cells, human chemosensitive chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells and chemoresistant K562/dx cells, human chemosensitive mesothelial Met5A cells and human chemoresistant malignant mesothelioma HMM cells, murine chemoresistant mammary JC cells were lysed and subjected to the Western blot analysis for Pgp, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, BCRP.
