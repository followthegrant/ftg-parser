This, in turn is governed to an extent, by the degree of phenotypic plasticity exhibited by the populations. The populations of same species inhabiting different climatic conditions may differ in their phenotypic plasticity. Himalayan populations of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> originating from a steep altitude are exposed to different climatic conditions ranging from sub-tropical to temperate. Thus they might have experienced different selection pressures during evolution and may respond differently under common environmental condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Phenotypic plasticity and differentiation of natural populations of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> grown under common garden and controlled conditions were determined. A total of seventeen morphological traits, their plasticity, association between traits and environment were performed using 45 accessions from three populations. Plants from different altitudes differed in phenotypes, their selection and fitness under two conditions. Under both the conditions lower altitude population was characterized by higher leaf count and larger silique than higher and middle altitude population. Flowering time of high altitude population increased while that of low and medium altitude decreased under controlled condition compared to open field. An increase in seed weight and germination was observed for all the population under open field than controlled. Rosette area was under divergent selection in both the condition. The heritability of lower altitude population was the highest under both the conditions, where as it was the least for higher altitude population further indicating that the high altitude populations are more responsive towards phenotypic changes under new environmental conditions. Ninety-nine percent of variability in traits and their plasticity co-varied with the altitude of their origin. The population of high altitude was more plastic and differentiated as compared to the lower altitude one.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">
<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> population native to different altitudes of the west Himalaya responds differently when grown under common environments. The success of high altitude population is more in common garden than the controlled conditions. The significant variability in phenotype and its association with altitude of origin predicts for non-random genetic differentiation among the populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12898-017-0149-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>West Himalaya</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Phenotypic differentiation</kwd><kwd>Phenotypic plasticity</kwd><kwd>Common garden</kwd><kwd>Controlled condition</kwd><kwd>Selection</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SIMPLE-(BSC-109)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>Sribash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">Plants being sessile organisms are frequently exposed to heterogeneous environmental conditions. The variation in environmental condition influences the evolution of traits and their differentiation. It can favour either local adaptation (adaptive differentiation/specialization) or evolution of plastic genotypes that respond through phenotypic plasticity (generalization). Both adaptive differentiation and phenotypic plasticity acts as major factor in generation of inter-individual variation and plant diversity. The amount of variation both within and among populations influences the response towards the changing environment. There has been a long standing interest to understand the role of plasticity on the performance of individuals, populations and species in new environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Variations in the environmental conditions can lead to both phenotypic and genotypic variations among the populations over a long period of time. Natural selection acting on phenotypes and their plasticity can cause evolution of populations leading to local adaptation.</p><p id="Par13">
<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.) Heynh., has recently been studied as a model plant species for the ecological and eco-genomics studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This is mainly because of its ease of growth and ubiquitous presence as well as publicly available large information resources. Being a model organism, it is important to quantify the diversity of this plant contributing to adaptation throughout its geographical distribution. There are reports of environmental influence on phenotypic traits like number of fruits, germination, length and width of fruits, flowering time, flooding response, etc. using field grown <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similarly, a few studies investigated the fitness of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants grown under field conditions and commented on morphological changes that are likely to result from varied environmental influence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There are also reports on phenotypic, physiological and gene expression profiling of plants grown either in simulated or controlled condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Phylogeography of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> in western Eurasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and its rapid expansion throughout the world has also been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Though, a lot of studies have been conducted throughout the world including other European populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], no such detailed studies have been conducted on highly diverse populations from West Himalaya. This incomplete sampling could limit our knowledge on extent of variation known in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p><p id="Par14">The West Himalayan populations are inhabited along wide altitude ranging from&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;700 to&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;3400&#x000a0;m amsl, which is also the altitudinal maxima of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> distribution reported so far. In contrast to predominantly temperate climatic condition in other European and American countries, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> growing along Himalayan altitude are exposed to sub-tropical to temperate climatic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus historically, these populations might have experienced different evolutionary pressure than the other world populations. However, these populations were never described earlier in terms of their phenotypic response towards different environmental conditions. These populations provide an opportunity for studying the effect of different environmental factors and their combinations on phenotypic diversity and differentiation. The strong variation in environmental factors along the steep altitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] can impose strong selection on traits leading to their adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The highest altitude population (~&#x000a0;3400&#x000a0;m amsl) which is exposed to extreme weather conditions might have evolved differently as compared to the more benign lower altitude population. Thus the fitness of this population may be higher under a common but heterogeneous environment as compared to lower altitude population. These populations are relatively old and harbour significant amount of genetic variations between the populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, these populations were also found to be genetically quite different from the rest of the world populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Here, we measured the phenotypic differentiation and plasticity of natural populations of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> from West Himalaya. A few studies had shown and argued that in order to understand population differentiation a relative analysis of the field and controlled grown plants is essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A significant variation in fitness has also been observed in mutants grown in the two conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We compared the level of plasticity of these populations exhibited due to interaction between genotypes and environment. Specifically, we asked the following questions: Do the populations from different altitudes differ in the expression of traits in the common garden and controlled conditions (i.e. plasticity)? Are these differentiations population specific in either conditions, and related to altitude? How the populations differ in the selection of the traits in the two conditions? Under which of the two novel conditions plants show more fitness? The variations in phenotype could be either due to adaptive differentiation or random by genetic drift. An association of phenotype under common growth condition to its native altitude and climate predicts for an adaptive genetic differentiation of these populations reducing chance of being a random processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These differences are also expected to indicate the abiotic stress experienced by the populations in the field conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trait variation among populations in either condition</title><p id="Par16">The three populations grown in common garden (CG) and controlled condition (GH) varied significantly for all the vegetative and reproductive traits, except a few (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Besides being significantly variable, some of the traits also followed a trend of either increase or decrease with altitude. For example, in CG the lower altitude population (Deh) was characterized by lower leaf area as compared to middle (Mun) and higher (Chit) altitude population. Whereas, in the GH Deh was characterized by wider leaves, longer petioles and larger leaf area as compared to other two populations. Leaf counts and silique length were higher in Deh as compared to Mun and Chit in both the conditions. Chit flowered the most late, followed by Mun and the Deh in both the conditions. The post hoc Bonferroni pair wise comparison between the populations indicated that the lower (Deh) and the highest altitude populations (Chit) were most differentiated under both the conditions. However, the middle altitude population (Mun) showed a variable trend, being more similar to the Deh and Chit under GH and CG condition, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Analysis of phenotypic variations under the two condition</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"/><th align="left" rowspan="2">Degree of freedom</th><th align="left" colspan="2">Common garden (CG)</th><th align="left" colspan="2">Controlled condition (GH)</th></tr><tr><th align="left">F value</th><th align="left">P value</th><th align="left">F value</th><th align="left">P value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="6">Vegetative traits (measured after 5&#x000a0;weeks of germination)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Leaf number</td><td align="left">2,42</td><td char="." align="char">6.8</td><td char="." align="char">

Significance of variation in the amount of phenotypic plasticity of each trait and population was tested by ANOVA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). Interestingly, we found that the variation in phenotypic plasticity between the extreme populations (Chit and Deh) were significant for all the traits. This differentiation decreased as the difference in altitude between the populations decreased. This is because there was no significant variation in the amount of plasticity for leaf shape, number of fruits, number of flowers and flowering time between Deh (lower altitude) and Mun (middle altitude). Although there was variations in slope of reaction norms for the number of fruits and flowers between Deh and Mun but there was no significant variation in their strength i.e., amount of plasticity. The plasticity of all the traits between Mun and Chit (middle and higher altitude) was significant, except plant height (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5).

Populations that grow under different climatic conditions are good source for studying these interactions and their effect on phenotype. In this study, we determined the phenotypic differentiation of natural populations of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> originating from different altitudes. These Indian populations are genetically diverse varying significantly from other world populations and are characterised by strong population structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The populations showed a clear differentiation on the basis of both absolute phenotype and their plasticity as demonstrated by the discriminant analysis. The existing genetic variations in these populations might be responsible for observed phenotypic variation of traits. The phenotypic variation can be achieved either in the form of adaptive differentiation (for traits that show similar trends in the phenotypic expression in the two conditions) or random phenotypic variation (for traits that show different trends in phenotype in the two conditions). For example, in Deh higher number of leaves and longer siliques were observed in both the conditions. In our earlier study, involving the same but native populations also showed that Deh had higher leaf numbers and longer siliques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This indicates that these traits are fixed. On the other hand, leaf and rosette shape were variable (varying non-significantly in CG and significantly in GH) when compared between CG and GH. Again, these two traits were not variable in their native sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Differences in the level of significance among the populations and the environmental conditions indicate that these characters are merely random in response and lack any adaptive differentiation. These populations, thus show both an adaptive differentiation and random response depending on environmental condition.</p><p id="Par28">Among the vegetative traits, leaf size and numbers are important adaptive traits. These traits in turns are correlated with other associated rosette and leaf traits. Larger and greater number of leaves was observed in the CG than the GH. Size variation have a direct effect on whole-plant growth rate, mainly through changes in the conductance of the boundary layer, affecting exchange of heat, uptake of carbon dioxide and transpiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This is mainly due to the fact that larger leaves having thicker boundary layer of slower convective heat loss tends to be hotter than ambient air temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In CG there was significant difference in day and night temperature. The large leaf in CG might help to maintain hotter temperature than the ambient air temperature prevalent during night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, this might be a limitation during water deficit conditions, but we provided sufficient water throughout the growth period. Thus, though edaphic factors and day temperature in field (~&#x000a0;22&#x02013;23&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) were similar with that of GH, there was significant difference in the light intensity and day/night temperature difference between the two conditions, responsible for above observation.</p><p id="Par29">Besides vegetative growth, flowering time is an important indicator of plant fitness. We observed significant differences in the flowering time between the two conditions as well as among the populations in a particular condition. Flowering time of Deh and Mun increased in the CG condition. This was in accordance to the earlier study that showed an increase in flowering time in the field conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In contrast, we observed a decrease in flowering time in the field conditions as compared to GH for higher altitude population (Chit). This may be due to the fact that while delayed bolting under benign conditions can lead to higher fecundity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], early flowering is advantageous in habitats where mortality is likely to be early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The winter (Dec&#x02013;Jan) and spring (Feb&#x02013;March) seasons in Lucknow, India is followed by hot and dry summer, where temperature rises beyond 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C which is unfavourable for growth of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> as against more suitable benign condition in GH. Thus, the CG grown Chit plants completed their life cycle earlier before the onset of unfavourable condition. On the other hand, the climatic factors in field condition of earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] was more favourable where the maximum temperature recorded during experiments was 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Further, this trend of flowering time indicates population specific response to climatic condition in context of flowering time. The high altitude population (Chit) might flower early, sensing the unfavourable condition in the CG whereas in GH it has favourable condition to prolong the life cycle. These findings indicate population specific dependency in flowering time under different conditions. This variation in flowering time among the populations is commonly reported in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">The reproductive traits (measured at the end of life cycle), represents the overall productivity, reproductive allocation and development of the plants. Among other reproductive traits, plant height and length of inflorescence are important traits. These traits were also correlated either positively or negatively with the most of the other traits. A number of studies describing shade avoidance syndrome have also shown an increase in plant height under shade conditions (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]). It has also been suggested that low light intensity favours the internodal elongation and hence an increase in plant height [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The increase in plant height observed in GH grown plants might be due to the low light in GH as compared to the CG. Seed sizes and germination ability, a measure of maternal investment also determine the plants adaptability under a particular environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Though there was no significant differences in these traits between any pair of populations in either conditions but when compared between the two environments, seed size (weight) increased in all the populations in CG. More particularly, the seed size differences were more in higher altitude populations (higher plasticity). This may be due to the higher adaptability of high altitude plants in more heterogeneous climatic conditions that is prevalent at high altitude as compared to low altitude plants. High altitude plants may produce more of these reproductive traits for better performance under such heterogeneous conditions.</p><p id="Par31">The observed significance of variation in phenotypic plasticity of the populations implies an underlying genetic polymorphism commonly found in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, the greater overall plasticity observed in the highest altitude plant (Chit) indicates that being exposed to more heterogeneous and stressful environment might have selected individuals having greater plasticity. The greater plasticity in the high altitude population in turn helps them to respond to more stressful and heterogeneous condition of CG than GH. The Deh population experiencing less heterogeneous and stressful conditions suffered a comparative loss of reproductive fitness in the CG. This was in accordance with the earlier study where gene ontology term enrichment of SNP containing genes for the lowest altitude population (Deh) did not retrieved any abiotic stress related term, while high altitude population (Mun and Chit) showed enrichment of GO terms related to high altitude stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Plasticity of the traits increases the ecological tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] which results in higher fitness. Thus the differences in the reproductive fitness observed between the populations were nullified when all the measured traits and their plasticity were included. Selection of more plastic genotypes for environmental heterogeneity has also been reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Further, partial least square method of path analysis showed that the different traits were differentially regulating reproductive fitness in the two conditions. The flowering time has been shown to significantly affect fitness of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. But this association was observed in the CG only. The adverse effect of increase in flowering time on the fitness was in accordance with earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The vegetative traits were shown to affect reproductive fitness through its correlated effects on flowering time and reproductive traits.</p><p id="Par33">The broad sense heritability of the traits differed between the two growth conditions. This observation for heritability of traits in two conditions suggests that heritability was a function of both genotype and environment. Overall the total variance of traits explained as genetic component (Q<sub>ST</sub>) was higher in the CG than GH. This also suggests that the expression of genetically driven phenotypes depends on the environmental condition. The Q<sub>ST</sub>&#x02013;F<sub>ST</sub> comparison of these traits helps in predicting the role of neutral or selective divergence in shaping phenotypic variation. Although the method of estimation has been criticized for its biasness due to its inherent theoretical caveats, but still it is commonly used to identify the adaptive traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Based on this approach we found that the different traits were under divergent selection in the two conditions. The only trait that was under selection in both the condition was rosette area, predicting it to be relevant under two conditions. Interestingly, the confidence interval of Q<sub>ST</sub> and F<sub>ST</sub> of flowering time overlapped suggesting its neutral divergence in these populations. In other studies this trait has been shown to be under local divergent selection both in the field and controlled conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The significance of variation of this trait in the two conditions and neutrality of its selection suggests for genetic drift effect. However, one needs to be careful in interpreting the data as accession used for estimating Q<sub>ST</sub> and F<sub>ST</sub> were different but from the same populations.</p><p id="Par34">Further, there was a significant multivariate association of all the phenotypic traits and their plasticity with the altitude of their native sites. This association of native altitude with the traits that were measured in the uncorrelated environmental conditions (CG and GH) predicts for an altitudinal divergence commonly found by other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

However, our analysis is limited due to use of low number of populations and thus caution may be taken to interpret this particular result.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par35">West Himalayan populations of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> showed significantly variable morphological response when grown in two different conditions. The traits that could be important for fitness under field condition may not play significant role under controlled conditions. These populations also showed differential genotype&#x02013;environment interaction for all the traits studied. Further, the high altitude population was more plastic and had higher reproductive fitness in CG as compared to the low altitude populations. The high altitude populations of Himalaya are exposed to harsh environmental condition and thus might have evolved to fit well in the heterogeneous condition (like CG), hence showing maximum plasticity and reproductive fitness as compared to the lower altitude populations. However, experimental validation needs to be performed using reciprocal transplant experiment to prove the observed phenomenon. We also emphasise that caution may be taken to interpret these results due to small population size. However, more efforts are being made to phenotype more populations from this region.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study population and experimental design</title><p id="Par36">The details of the populations and climatic condition of the native sites have been reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

Seeds were grown for one generation under controlled conditions in order to eliminate effect due to level of seed maturity in field conditions.

Leaf area was estimated as product of length and width, while leaf shape was represented as a ratio of length to width. Rosette area was measured as product of major and minor axis and rosette shape as a ratio of major to minor axis. We considered both the leaf and rosette shape as rounded when the ratio is close to one and elongated if the ratio was more than one. The plants were censused in every two days for the estimation of flowering time until all plants have bolted. Flowering time was estimated as number of days from germination to bolting. After the completion of life cycle, percentage of total number of flowers produced that converted into fruits was used to estimate fertility percentage.
