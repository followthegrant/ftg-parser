performance at workplace. We attempted to evaluate nurses&#x02019; knowledge and attitude toward
HIV-infected patients and their underlying factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study participated by 218 nurses and
collected relevant data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Majority (57.3%) of the nurses had 1 to 5 years of experience in the nursing job, and
78.4% of them were involved in the provision of direct care to HIV-infected individuals
for &#x02264;5 years, and only 6.4% for &#x02265;11 years. The overall knowledge and attitude of the
participants were good (3.25/5 and 3.42/5 scores, respectively). The knowledge regarding
appropriate care of HIV-infected patients was significantly better among the registered
nurses compared to nursing assistants (NA) with limited years of formal education (odds
ratio [OR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.20-0.69; <italic>P</italic>
&#x0003c;.001). In the provision of care to the HIV-infected patients, the attitude of female
participants was significantly better than the males (unadjusted OR = 0.18; 95% CI =
0.05-0.60; <italic>P</italic> = .01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Inclusion of relevant HIV- and AIDS-related topics in the curriculum for NAs and
closely guided hands-on training of the nurses are likely to improve nurses&#x02019; knowledge
and attitude toward the provision of care to HIV-infected individuals.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</kwd><kwd>nurses</kwd><kwd>knowledge</kwd><kwd>attitudes</kwd><kwd>Barbados</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section4-2325958219880592"><title>Introduction</title><p>HIV and AIDS are a major global health problem and the 10th leading cause of

nurses were recruited between January and April 2013. There are 2 major hospitals (Queen
Elizabeth Hospital [QEH] and Bayview Hospital), 5 district hospitals, a psychiatric
hospital, and 8 polyclinics in Barbados. The study involved nurses working at the QEH, the
foremost teaching hospital, and all 5 district hospitals, the psychiatric hospital, and
the Ladymeade Reference Unit (LRU) clinic to facilitate representative sampling and
minimize selection bias. The QEH, the St Michael Geriatric District Hospital, the Black
Rock Psychiatric Hospital, and LRU clinic are located in the parish of St Michael. The
other district hospitals, namely the Gordon Cummins District Hospital, the St Lucy
District Hospital, the Elayne Scantlebury Hospital, and the St Philip District Hospital
are located in St Thomas, St Lucy, St Lucy, and St Philip parishes, respectively. The
Gordon Cummins District Hospital is a referral hospital. St Lucy is one of the oldest
district hospitals that manages mainly the geriatric patients. The Elayne Scantlebury and
St Phillip District Hospitals provide care and treatment to mentally and physically
challenged patients. The Black Rock Psychiatric Hospital is the largest of the 3 different
psychiatric facilities. Of the 8 polyclinics, the LRU was selected as they primarily
provide care and treatment to patients infected with HIV and AIDS.</p></sec><sec id="section8-2325958219880592"><title>Study Population</title><p>There were 598, 237, 259, and 5 nursing staffs in the QEH, 5 district hospitals, the
psychiatric hospital, and LRU, respectively, that is, 1099 in total. Using StatCalc of Epi
Info, we estimated the sample size of 276 (25% of the total nurses) to identify the
overall expected frequency of knowledge and attitude in caring for HIV-infected patients
with 95% confidence interval (CI). We included nurses who were working and had experience
with people living with HIV/AIDS. Student nurses and other medical personnel were excluded
from this study.</p></sec><sec id="section9-2325958219880592"><title>Data Collection</title><p>Director of nursing services of all the study hospitals and clinic provided consent for
the study and circulated a memorandum to the nurses in their respective hospitals
informing them about the research study and its purpose, requesting for their full
cooperation and support and their voluntary participation. The hospital directors provided
lists of all the nurses who included their name, designation, and department of work. We
employed systematic sampling and invited every fifth nurses to take part in the study.
Following this, the researchers met with the participants in their respective hospitals
and clinic during their work hours, informed them about the purpose and process of the
study, the voluntary nature of their participation and maintenance of their
confidentiality, and the benefits and risks from participation. Questionnaires were
collected from participants directly and also through the nursing in-charge at different
times with sealed envelopes after keeping under lock and key to maintain the
confidentiality.</p><p>We employed a self-administrable questionnaire, based on the studies conducted by
Population Council/Horizons Program on &#x0201c;Improving Hospital Environment for HIV and AIDS
clients in India&#x0201d; for collection of study data.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325958219880592" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> We pretested the questionnaire on 50 nurses selected by also systemic randomization
from the same hospitals and clinic and excluded them from the list to avoid further
participation in the main study. The questionnaire was checked for internal consistency
and reliability analysis of the items included and modified as appropriate. With regard to
nurses&#x02019; knowledge and attitude toward HIV-infected patients, we considered Cronbach &#x003b1;
value of 0.79 and 0.86 (values between 0.6 and 0.9 considered adequate), respectively, as
indicative of high internal consistency.</p><p>The structured questionnaire had 45 items under 4 sections: demographics, knowledge about
the disease, hospital policy, and attitude while providing care to patients living with
HIV/AIDS. Demographic section included the participants&#x02019; workplace (the study hospitals
and clinic) and their age, sex, salary, marital status, education, position, training, and
experiences (<xref rid="table1-2325958219880592" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The
knowledge-related section included 9-item questions to assess participants&#x02019; knowledge for
maintaining patient&#x02019;s confidentiality, code of nursing ethics, recapping of needles, their
rights to know patient&#x02019;s HIV status, patients&#x02019; consent for HIV testing, etiology and mode
of transmission, and universal precautions for caring of patients living with HIV/AIDS.
The responses were based on 5-point Likert scale (1 for strongly disagree and 5 for
strongly agree), and those with a score below 3.0 (cutoff point 2.9) were considered to
have poor and those with scores &#x02265;3.0 as having good knowledge (<xref rid="table2-2325958219880592" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The policy section included questions to
assess participants&#x02019; knowledge about their hospital&#x02019;s policy on protecting the safety from
exposure to HIV, universal precautions, HIV testing, grievance office to complain on
nursing care, management, and prevention of needle stick injury from HIV-infected
patients. Their responses to these questions were yes, no, and do not know. The attitude
section had also 9 items, with questions such as if they felt that the patients were
responsible for being infected, fear for getting infection from the HIV-infected patients,
considered treating HIV-infected patients as waste of resources, what type of nursing care
they could be expected from the hospitals, using the Likert scale and the same scoring as
for knowledge (<xref rid="table3-2325958219880592" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1-2325958219880592" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the Participating Nurses.<sup>a</sup>

correct possible errors. Descriptive statistics, including means, frequencies, and
percentages, were calculated for the variables as appropriate. The power (90%) of the
tests was calculated for a sample size of 276 respondents from 8 study hospitals and
clinic. The odds ratio (OR) and their 95% CI were computed to determine the strength of
associations between variables which were run adjusted and unadjusted (CIs and

their <italic>P</italic> value was &#x02264;.05. Overall, knowledge/attitude was the mean score of
the total means. In the logistic regression, knowledge and attitude were used as dependent
(outcome) variables, and the age, gender, types of hospitals, salary, marital status,
level of education, designation, and HIV-related experience were used as explanatory

of getting infected while providing care to the patients living with HIV/AIDS. An earlier
university community study observed a general lack of understanding about personal risks,
despite knowing the modes of transmission and the means to prevent HIV and AIDS, which was
associated with unsafe sex and sex with multiple partners, also reflecting their attitudes

</p><p>About half (51.3%) of our study participants felt that homosexual behavior was the reason

</p><p>The QEH is a teaching hospital in Barbados, and we expected the participants to be
conversant with their job-related hospital policies including procedures to be followed in
the management and treatment of HIV-infected patients; however, we found a significant

of the participants were neither aware nor even certain about the availability of PEP.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2325958219880592" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The finding suggests the need for improving the induction and orientation to their
job to ensure that the nurses are conversant about workplace/job-related policies, with an
emphasis on occupational safety and prophylactic measures. Availability of PEP and its
effective communication is important to improve workers knowledge of PEP.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2325958219880592" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In terms of gender, female nurses had more positive attitudes toward the patients

nurses at other hospitals/clinics involved in the study. This was expected since QEH is a
teaching hospital, and thus, the nurses are exposed to more current information and
practices. The length of work experiences positively correlated with knowledge and attitude.
Knowledge and attitude are influenced by the education, training, and hands-on experience in
dealing with HIV-infected patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2325958219880592" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The Canadian Association of Nurses in AIDS Care integrated HIV- and AIDS-related

self-reported answers to our questionnaires, which might have been associated with a

hand, the study was conducted among the nurses from different hospitals and HIV and AIDS

Barbadian nurses in the provision of direct care to HIV-infected patients and to understand
the factors that shape their attitudes. Our study findings support the need to improve
nurses&#x02019; overall knowledge on HIV, especially its cause and mode of transmission, workplace
safety particularly universal precaution, and postexposure policies and processes, to
improve their attitude. Registered nurses with 4 years of education were more knowledgeable
than the NAs with 1 year of certificate course. Addition of HIV-related topics in the
curriculum and establishment of effective continued professional development courses, guided
training by seniors at the workplace, could improve their confidence and thus improve their
attitude on HIV and AIDS. Effective institutional systems must also be put in place to
inform nurses on job-related policies, mode of transmission of the disease, precaution, and
prophylactic management to change and improve their attitude in discharging their assigned
responsibilities. It is also possible to improve knowledge and skills of the nurses,
especially NAs, impacting positively on the attitude through on-the-job, practical oriented
training, before placing them in specialized units, such as HIV and AIDS wards. Evaluation
of the current nursing curriculum and the addition of topics to improve the knowledge and
supervised on-the-job training could further help improve nursing care including the
