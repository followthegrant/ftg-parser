The CLPs share significant sequence and structural similarities with active chitinases, however, do not display chitinase activity. Some of these proteins are reported to have specific functions and carbohydrate binding property. In the present study, we report a novel chitinase like lectin (TCLL) from <italic>Tamarindus indica</italic>. The crystal structures of native TCLL and its complex with N-acetyl glucosamine were determined. Similar to the other CLPs of the GH18 members, TCLL lacks chitinase activity due to mutations of key active site residues. Comparison of TCLL with chitinases and other chitin binding CLPs shows that TCLL has substitution of some chitin binding site residues and more open binding cleft due to major differences in the loop region. Interestingly, the biochemical studies suggest that TCLL is an N-acetyl glucosamine specific chi-lectin, which is further confirmed by the complex structure of TCLL with N-acetyl glucosamine complex. TCLL has two distinct N-acetyl glucosamine binding sites S1 and S2 that contain similar polar residues, although interaction pattern with N-acetyl glucosamine varies extensively among them. Moreover, TCLL structure depicts that how plants utilize existing structural scaffolds ingenuously to attain new functions. To date, this is the first structural investigation of a chi-lectin from plants that explore novel carbohydrate binding sites other than chitin binding groove observed in GH18 family members. Consequently, TCLL structure confers evidence for evolutionary link of lectins with chitinases.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Financial support has been provided for this work by Department of Science and Technology (DST ref no.

Plant lectins are heterogeneous and highly diverse class of non-immune origin (glyco) proteins because of their carbohydrate-binding specificity, differences in molecular structure and biochemical properties <xref rid="pone.0063779-Damme1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. For specific recognition, lectins have at least one non-catalytic domain, which reversibly bind to sugars or glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids and do not modify the structure of carbohydrates <xref rid="pone.0063779-Damme1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Lectins were first discovered in plants and later identified in organisms from all kingdoms of life <xref rid="pone.0063779-DeHoff1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Plant lectins are classified into twelve diverse families of evolutionary and structurally related lectin domains <xref rid="pone.0063779-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-VanDamme1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Till now, it is an open question whether these twelve families form a closed or expandable group. Lectins show extensive structural diversity with the mutual orientations of the subunits in the tertiary folds giving rise to a variety of quaternary structures. These quaternary structures produce higher order sugar specificities, although oligomerization is not necessary for ligand recognition since single subunit of plant lectins were found to be able to bind carbohydrate <xref rid="pone.0063779-Sinha1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Considering the structural architecture, plant lectins are grouped into seven folds <xref rid="pone.0063779-Chandra1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. There is no precise description for the biological function of the plant lectins because of their diverse classes and carbohydrate specificities. The lectins with homologous sequences also have different biological roles and their function cannot be generalized. Rigorous investigations need to be carried out for an understanding of the biological roles of individual lectins. Some functional characteristics of particular lectins reported in literature include antifungal <xref rid="pone.0063779-Kaur1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, insecticidal <xref rid="pone.0063779-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, antiviral <xref rid="pone.0063779-Ye1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, antiproliferative, apoptosis-inducing <xref rid="pone.0063779-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and symbiosis mediating between nitrogen fixing microorganisms and legume plants <xref rid="pone.0063779-DeHoff1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Another group that also encompasses the lectins is the glycosyl hydrolase family 18 (GH18) of chitinases. This family contains chitinase like lectins (chi-lectins)/proteins (CLPs) along with active chitinases. The CLPs are members of chitinase family in fold ((&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>8</sub> barrel) while they might possess or lack chitinase activity. For example, <italic>Parkia platycephala</italic> lectin 2 (PPL2), an N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) binding lectin displaying chitinase activity is homologous to class III chitinases of the GH18 family <xref rid="pone.0063779-Cavada1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The mammalian chi-lectins are also included in the family of GH18, which do not have chitinase activity. Some examples are YKL-40 (chitinase 3-like-1/HC-gp39/Chi3l1) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Fusetti1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> YKL-39 (chitinase 3-like-2) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Marianne1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, mouse Ym1/2 (chitinase 3-like-3/4), stabilin-1-interacting chitinase like protein (SI-CLP) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, SPX-40 proteins (SPG-40, SPC-40, SPS-40 and MGP-40) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Kumar2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Srivastava1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Mohanty1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> breast regression protein-39 (BRP-39, GenBank accession no. ABY53363) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Morrison1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, rat cartilage glycoprotein (RATgp39, GenBank accession no. AF062038), oviduct-specific glycoprotein (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_001073685.1). Some of these proteins are reported to have carbohydrate binding ability such as, 39-kDa human cartilage glycoprotein (HCgp-39), YKL-39, SI-CLP, SPS-40 and SPG-40 binds chitin fragment and Ym1 binds glucosamine and heparin/heparan sulfate. However, their physiological functions are not clearly understood <xref rid="pone.0063779-Fusetti1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Some of these CLPs have specific function like XIP-I, a xylanase inhibitor protein I from <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0063779-Payan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and XAIP, xylanase and alpha-amylase inhibitor protein from <italic>Scadoxus multiflorus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0063779-Kumar3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.To gain further insight into structure-function relationship of such chitinase like lectins in general, GlcNAc binding glycoprotein, a tamarind chitinase like lectin (TCLL) was identified and analyzed by X-ray diffraction and biochemical &#x00026; biophysical approach. Here, we present a high resolution crystal structure of TCLL and its complex with GlcNAc. TCLL displays significant sequence and structural similarity with members of GH18 family but the active site residues for chitinase activity along with chitin binding cleft residues were found to be mutated. So, TCLL lacks chitinase activity as well as binding to chitin polymer. The biochemical studies shows that TCLL is a chi-lectin and has specific carbohydrate recognition and different binding site than chitin binding site observed in the GH18 family chitinases. However, TCLL shows scant sequence and structural similarity with plant lectins and has different interacting residues with GlcNAc. Moreover, the structure depicts evolutionary relationship with class III chitinases and bestows the ability of plant to expand the sugar binding domain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The human blood samples were collected and the experiments were performed with the understanding and written consent of the Institutional Human Ethical Committee (IHEC), Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee 247667, India.

For hemagglutination assay, 3% (v/v) suspension of human red blood cells in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) was prepared. Serial dilution of purified TCLL (50 &#x000b5;l) was taken in microtiter U-plate and was mixed with 50 &#x000b5;l of diluted erythrocytes cells. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 h.

Fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer. Emission spectra were recorded from 291&#x02013;500 nm upon excitation at 290 nm. Excitation and emission slits were maintained at 5 nm and the scan speed was set at 100 nm/min. Standard reaction mixtures were prepared using 0.5 &#x000b5;M solution of protein in 25 mM phosphate buffer saline, pH 7.2 to a final volume of 1 ml. To study the binding affinity of monosaccharides (N-acetyl glucosamine, N-acetyl galactosamine, dextrose, glucose and galactose) to the enzyme, the additives were pre-incubated for 20 min and then spectra were obtained. The spectrum was corrected for background emission generated by buffer and ligands and the experiments were repeated in duplicates.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Measurement of Binding Property by ITC</title><p>To measure accurately the binding affinity of TCLL to different sugars, isothermal titration calorimetry was employed to compare the binding affinity of GlcNAc, chitobiose, chitotetrose and chitohexose to TCLL. This was done by monitoring the energetics of molecular interactions at a constant temperature on iTC<sub>200</sub> Isothermal titration calorimetry (GE Healthcare). The solutions were degassed to avoid air bubbles in the calorimeter during the experiment. The sample cell was filled with 0.3 mM protein solution and the injection syringe was filled with 8 mM sugar in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4). The reaction was monitored for binding study with injections of 2 &#x000b5;l each for 10&#x02013;20 injections having 100 sec of interval between them at 25&#x000b0;C.

TCLL showed the lattice formation of the erythrocytes of all the blood groups at a concentration of approximately 45 &#x000b5;g/mL as examined under the microscope. The formation of lattice was inhibited by 10 mM GlcNAc but not with other sugars tested. Further, binding studies of the sugar moieties was carried out by exploiting the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence property of the protein. It was observed that addition of GlcNAc (1&#x02013;20 mM) to a solution of protein resulted in quenching of the fluorescence between 310&#x02013;320 nm without any shift of wavelength emission maxima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063779-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The fluorescence quenching occurred till 10 mM GlcNAc and beyond this concentration there was no detectable change in the spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063779-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). No other sugar showed any noteworthy change in the fluorescence intensity indicating that TCLL has affinity specifically for GlcNAc moiety. The binding activity of TCLL was analyzed for various polysaccharides of different lengths using ITC.

The GlcNAc molecule accommodates well in the pocket and is delimited by polar amino acids. GlcNAc atoms interact with two pocket residues (Glu119 and Arg152) directly and three pocket residues (Gln74, Tyr121 and Asp123) through three water molecules (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063779.s007">Data S1</xref>).

Eight water molecules in the cavity form hydrogen bonds with GlcNAc moiety, among which three water molecules take part in stabilization by interacting with protein residues. The GlcNAc molecule interacts with Glu132 and Tyr167 directly and with Tyr168 and Lys171 through water. Comparison of the GlcNAc binding site S1 and S2 of TCLL shows that these pockets are surrounded by similar polar amino acids such as glutamate, tyrosine and arginine/lysine but the interactions of GlcNAc atoms with these amino acids differ drastically as summarized in Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063779.s007">Data S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Substrate Binding Channel and Active Site Architecture for Chitinase Activity</title><p>The attempts to obtain crystals of the protein in complex with chitotriose, chitotetraose and chitohexaose were unsuccessful; the substrate binding site was examined and compared with the other GH18 family members. These subsite grooves are formed in TCLL by joining the carboxyl terminal residues of the &#x003b2;-strands with their subsequent loops. Compared to hevamine, the architecture of the subsites is different with some residues that interact with oligosaccharide being substituted. The subsite &#x02212;4 in TCLL formed by loops &#x003b2;1&#x003b1;1 and &#x003b2;2&#x003b1;2 contains Gly18, Asn55 and Ala58 similar to hevamine residues Gly11, Asn45 and Gly48 indicating that this subsite in TCLL might accommodate the substrate. However, the existence of one extra helix &#x003b1;1&#x02032; (Asp20-Glu23) immediately above Gly18, might hamper the entry of chitooligosaccharide. The side chains of Ser19 and Asp20 protrude in the pocket with Gly18 hidden beneath Ser19 so that it might fail to attain the N-acetyl glucosamine moiety. The subsite &#x02212;3 is present on the same loop as &#x02212;4 is and includes Gln16 and Asn55 (Gln9 and Asn45 in hevamine). Two striking differences were observed in the TCLL &#x02212;4 and &#x02212;3 subsites as compared to hevamine: one is that these two subsites are very close to each other (the C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> distance between Gly18 and Gln16 is 5.5 &#x000c5; compared to 6.6 &#x000c5; of corresponding hevamine residues) and second that the cavity formed by loops is wider than hevamine; so most likely it may not able to grip two GlcNAc moieties. As for subsite &#x02013;2, it is the most disturbed site. The loop forming this groove - &#x003b2;3&#x003b1;3 - is very different in TIM barrel topology with extra &#x003b2;-strand (&#x003b2;3&#x02032;). It protrudes straight away from core barrel rather than forming pocket and seems to be flung out from (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>8</sub> fold. However, in hevamine, strand &#x003b2;3 moves little inside in the barrel and the corresponding loop is projected in the groove and arranged in such a way that it holds chitin molecule by interacting with it. The residues Val87 and Thr88 on one side of the groove on the extra &#x003b2;3 strand and Phe256 on the opposite side of the groove from this subsite in TCLL are substituted (natural variants) as compared to hevamine Gly81, Ile82 and Trp255 residues. The C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> distance between Val87 and Phe256 is 21.7 &#x000c5;, which is very high as compared to that in hevamine (11.9 &#x000c5;) and forms very shallow and broad cavity. The residue Thr88 participates in hydrogen bond interaction with Thr45 of strand &#x003b2;2&#x02032; which is parallel to &#x003b2;3&#x02032; and is involved in stabilization of strand rather than participation in accepting GlcNAc moiety. Thr88 is also engaged in hydrogen bonding with Asp47 so that overall this groove is completely unsuitable and may not hold chitin molecule.</p><p>The most crucial subsite &#x02212;1 contains Gln184, Tyr187, Leu227 and Val87 that correspond to Gln181, Asn184, Ala224 and Gly81 of hevamine. Tyr187 protrudes in the cavity and reduces the ability to bind GlcNAc. The architecture of the loop that contains Ala224 in hevamine is such that it bends toward the core barrel and is involved in making cavity while Ala224 form hydrogen bond with O6 of GlcNAc moiety. This type of interaction is not possible in the TCLL structure because the loop moves away from barrel and the residue Leu227 is not able to interact with O6 of GlcNAc and also has rigid &#x003b2;-turn conformation. The C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> distance between Val87 and Leu227 is 25.5 &#x000c5;, whereas the corresponding distance in hevamine is 12.3 &#x000c5;. Overall, this subsite is also not favorable for binding to chitin molecule. The key residues for catalytic activity are Asp125, Glu127 and Tyr183 in hevamine. Glu127 is considered to donate a proton to glycosidic bond <xref rid="pone.0063779-Bokma1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-TerwisschavanScheltinga1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Tews1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Asp125 stabililizes the transition state during hydrolysis and Tyr183 assist Asp125 in making hydrogen bond to carbonyl oxygen of the N-acetyl group. It has been shown that mutation of the very important catalytic residue glutamate (Glu127) in hevamine impaired the chitinase activity <xref rid="pone.0063779-Bokma1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Watanabe1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The respective residues in TCLL are Ala128, Val130 and Phe186. Neither Ala128 nor Phe186 side chain is able to make hydrogen bond with GlcNAc residue to stabilize the oxazolium intermediate. The most important residue glutamate is substituted to valine that cannot donate a proton to the scissile bond. The loop that bears Ala128 and Val130 has different orientation than the corresponding loop in hevamine. Corresponding residues of the active site and substrate binding site of TCLL and hevamine are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063779-g006">Figure 6</xref>.

This suggests that TCLL displays an overall fold similar to those of the above structures except some loop deviations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063779.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Compared to hevamine, some structural features in TCLL are different - such as glycosylation at Asn146, substitutions in the substrate binding site and the active site, smaller sizes of strand &#x003b2;1 and helix &#x003b1;3 than corresponding hevamine strand and helix, different conformation and extra strands of loops &#x003b2;2&#x003b1;2 and &#x003b2;3&#x003b1;3, loop &#x003b2;3&#x003b1;3 obtrusion from (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>8</sub> fold forming hinge like conformation and some major divergence of loops &#x003b2;4&#x003b1;4, &#x003b2;7&#x003b1;7 and &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;4. Asp123 &#x00026; Trp179 are strictly conserved in all members of family 18 plant chitinases <xref rid="pone.0063779-vanScheltinga1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. While aspartate is conserved, tryptophan is replaced by phenylalanine in TCLL. Unlike PPL2, which is an endochitinase with N-acetyl glucosamine binding hemagglutinin, TCLL shows glycosylation and lacks endochitinase activity due to substitution of active side residues. Nevertheless TCLL is N-acetyl glucosamine binding lectin that shows lattice formation of human erythrocytes. Comparison of GlcNAc binding sites of TCLL with PPL2 demonstrates that PPL2 has similar type of residues at corresponding site of S1 pocket and can bind GlcNAc. The variation was observed at loop &#x003b2;4&#x003b1;4 of S2 pocket, which is longer and forms cavity. The residues of S2 that hold the GlcNAc are also substituted in PPL2. The corresponding cavity in PPL2 is shallow and might not interact with GlcNAc.</p><p>Concanavalin B, XIP-I and XAIP belongs to GH18 family as they preserved some characteristic features of this family <xref rid="pone.0063779-Kumar3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Hennig1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Payan2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> but are devoid of chitinase activity due to substitution of key residues of active site.

Narbonin has Glu132 at similar position to hevamine catalytic glutamate and still do not show chitinase activity as Glu132 is engaged with Arg87 in forming salt bridge. One extra disulphide bond in concanavalin B Cys41&#x02013;Cys93, which is engaged in stabilization of the loops &#x003b2;2&#x003b1;2 and &#x003b2;3&#x003b1;3 is observed that is unusual for the GH18 family <xref rid="pone.0063779-Hennig1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> whereas, XIP-I and XAIP shows only two disulphide bonds <xref rid="pone.0063779-Kumar3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Payan2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. When compared to XIP-I which is a dual inhibitor of xylanase belonging to GH10 and GH11 family <xref rid="pone.0063779-Payan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, loop &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;5 in TCLL is shorter in length. The elongated loop observed in XIP-I enter into the cavity of GH11 xylanase and residue Arg149 interact direct with active site residues Glu85 and Glu176 while such interacting residues are missing in TCLL. GH10 xylanase also has a TIM barrel topology and is inhibited by XIP-I helix &#x003b1;7 (232&#x02013;245) that blocks central part of substrate binding groove (&#x02212;3 to +2). The residues Lys234 interact directly with Glu131 and through water with Glu239. In TCLL, the corresponding helix residues are substituted. Other interacting residues 225 to 232 display different conformations and this loop moves towards core barrel rather than protrude out. Residues 189 to 205 attained some amino acid insertions and the resultant longer loop adopts &#x003b2;-turn conformation that obstructs the interaction with helix &#x003b1;7. Overall, TCLL might not function like XIP-I. XAIP shows GH11 xylanase and GH13 &#x003b1;-amylase inhibition.

The residues that putatively interact with chitin are substituted in TCLL. The groove formed in HCgp-39 is long and deep allowing it to accommodate chitin fragment faultlessly. However, in case of TCLL, chitin binding cavity is shorter and very superficial. Moreover, the cavity forming loops on the opposite sides are very apart thus resulting in an open cavity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063779.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

The structure of chitin fragment bound HCgp-39 suggests that chitin, which is structural element of nematodal and fungal pathogen to human, can be physiological ligand of HCgp-39.

Comparison of TCLL structure with YKL-39&#x02013;(GlcNAc)<sub>6</sub> complex structure shows that substitution of conserved residues reported to have interaction with chitin polymer at chitin binding groove. There are also some loop region differences are observed which hold the GlcNAc polymer. The corresponding residues Tyr104, Tyr146, Asp213, Tyr269 and Trp360 which makes interaction with GlcNAc in YKL-39 structure are replaced with Gln86, Pro131, Tyr187, Thr224 and Phe256 in TCLL. The respective cleft forming loops, which hold Tyr269 and Tyr104 in YKL-39, are far apart from each other in TCLL making an open cavity. Apart from those aromatic residues, Trp36 and Trp218 observed in sugar binding cleft are also substituted in TCLL. YKL-39 has retained the ability to bind chitin polymer and can be reverted back to active chitinase by substituting with catalytic residues at active site and hence called as pseudo-chitinase. In case of TCLL, major differences lie at chitin binding cleft could be the reason for loosing chitin binding property.</p><p>Another 40 kDa glycoprotein, SPG-40 is reported to have GlcNAc polymer binding property but no catalytic activity observed due to the mutation of a catalytic Glu residue to Leu.

The major differences are also observed in loop regions which form the groove that could be the reason for making distorted groove in TCLL. Another member of GH-18 family, SI-CLP contains a typically wide, more open and saddle-shaped sugar binding cleft. The longer and negatively charge cleft may be the reason behind the broad ligand recognition of SI-CLP. The conserved aromatic amino acids of the cleft are also present in SI-CLP.

Structural comparison of TCLL with SI-CLP shows that large differences at the cleft forming loops make distorted cavity in TCLL. Conclusively, structural comparison of TCLL with CLPs, which have chitin binding ability shows that TCLL has substitution in the solvent-exposed aromatic residues. These hydrophobic residues form stacking interaction with sugars and they are conserved in HCgp-39, YKL-39, SI-CLP, SPS-40 and SPG-40 and their extensive interaction with chitin shows that these residues are important for its binding.

In case of TCLL, this site is not properly defined, shallow and interacting residues were not found conserved. One another member of this family is IDGF-2 from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. The structure of IDGF-2 shows partly blocked binding cavity that lacks a proper configuration of residues for binding to oligosaccharides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063779.s005">Figure S5</xref>). However, it has been proposed that it might promote cell proliferation by assisting insulin. The structure of SPC-40 also shows GH18 chitinase like fold but has no catalytic activity. This protein has some conserved aromatic amino acids at the chitin binding cleft which are reported for saccharide binding. However, they are unable to bind to chitin polymer due to some variations in the neighbouring residues and change in the shape of its cavity <xref rid="pone.0063779-Kumar2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Structural superimposition of TCLL with SPC-40 proteins shows high r.m.s. deviation and large variation in loop regions. Comparison with chitin binding groove also shows major differences in the lining residues and loop variation, which makes unique shape cleft in TCLL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063779.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>These structural comparisons reflect that GH18 chitinase like proteins preserve the TIM barrel domain of the family with no chitinase activity and they have evolved to participate in diverse functions. TCLL has TIM barrel domain without a well-defined chitin binding groove and lacks the catalytic activity. However, it has binding affinity for GlcNAc that explains the evolutionary progression from chitinase to chitinase like lectin. The biological significance of GlcNAc binding of TCLL, however, needs to be explored further.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Comparison with Other GlcNAc Binding Lectins</title><p>As TCLL is GlcNAc binding chi-lectin, we evaluated the structure of other GlcNAc binding proteins. For example, <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic> lectin (ABL) (PDB: 1Y2X) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Carrizo1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <italic>Boletus edulis</italic> lectin (BEL) (PDB: 3QDV) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Bovi1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <italic>Sclerotium rolfsii</italic> lectin (SRL) (PDB: 2OFE) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Leonidas1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <italic>Ulex europaeus</italic> lectin II (PDB: 1QOO) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Loris1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <italic>Psathyrella velutina</italic> lectin (PVL) (PDB: 2C4D) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Cioci1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (PDB: 2UVO) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Schwefel1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, and two lectins which are specific for saccharides containing GlcNAc namely, <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> agglutinin (UDA-VI) (PDB: 1EHH) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Harata1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> and <italic>Phytolacca americana</italic> lectin (PL-D2) (1ULM) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Hayashida1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Structurally, TCLL does not display any similarity with the aforesaid GlcNAc binding proteins. Further, the GlcNAc interacting residues and environment of the cavity were compared. ABL has two diverse binding sites that differentiate in to different configurations at a single epimeric hydroxyl site. The GlcNAc interacted mainly with residues Asp79, Ile80, Thr82, Arg103 and Tyr113 of ABL. BEL has two sites: site 1 that hold the GalNAc and T-antigen disaccharide while site 2 is most likely chitin binding site having preference for GlcNAc and chitobiose. The interacting residues of BEL with GlcNAc are Asp78, Val79, Thr81, Arg102 and Tyr113. Asp78 defines specificity for binding to GlcNAc as its carboxylate oxygens form hydrogen bonds with O4 and O6 of the GlcNAc. SRL is similar to ABL and BEL with two distinct carbohydrate-binding sites, a primary and a secondary site. GalNAc is attached at the primary while GlcNAc prefers only the secondary site. Residues Asp77, Ile78, Thr80, Arg101, and Tyr112 are involved in hydrogen bonds with GlcNAc moiety. ABL, BEL and SRL have common interacting residues that delineate specificity to GlcNAc. The interactions of GlcNAc O3 and O4 with tyrosine, O4 and O6 with aspartate and O5 and O6 with arginine are the common specificity pattern in ABL, BEL and SRL. In TCLL-GlcNAc complex, such types of interactions are not observed (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063779.s007">Data S1</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Ulex europaeus</italic> lectin II contains promiscuous carbohydrate-binding site with triad of Asp86/Gly106/Asn136 that accommodates GlcNAc, galactose and fucosylgalactose. PVL binds GlcNAc at six different sites with minor differences in binding mode. Two hydrogen bonds are formed by the side chain of one asparagine (or aspartate) residue with the O3 and O4 of GlcNAc. The O3 also develops a hydrogen bond to a conserved tryptophan. Hydrophobic contacts with GlcNAc are made by conserved histidine and tyrosine at each site. WGA has four hevein domains in each polypeptide. Structure of WGA complexed with GlcNAc displays five binding sites and residues (Asp or Glu/Ser/Ser/Tyr) of cavity built by hevein domains of 36-kDa homodimer interact with GlcNAc moiety. UDA-VI has two hevein analogous domains. The complex structure of UDA-VI with NAG3 displays two binding sites of UDA-VI molecule. One NAG3 is sandwiched between two molecules of UDA-VI. The hevein domain residues Trp21/Trp23and Ser19/Cys24/Tyr30 of domain 1 and His67/Trp69 and Ser65/Tyr76 of domain 2 recognize and interact with NAG3 molecule. PL-D2 also has two hevein domains (I and II) and the interacting residues in its complex with NAG3 are Ser20, Trp22, Tyr24 and Tyr31 of domain I and Trp43, Ser61, Tyr63, Trp65 and His72 of domain II. Taken together, comparison with other GlcNAc binding lectins shows that TCLL has different architecture of cavity and novel binding mode, which has not been documented so far in other plant lectins and chilectins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on the significant sequence identity, TCLL seems to be a member of the class III chitinase of GH18 family. The crystal structure of TCLL also shows similar (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>8</sub> TIM barrel topology as those of GH18 family members. However, it has some distinct structural features which are unusual for the (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>8</sub> topology such as long &#x003b2;2&#x003b1;2 loop which contain an antiparallel &#x003b2;-hairpin. The other unusual loop &#x003b2;3&#x003b1;3 also revealed insertion of a &#x003b2;-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063779-g004">Figure 4</xref>). A single glycosylation site with two units of GlcNAc was also observed in TCLL structure. Glycosylation is very rare in plant GH18 chitinases of class III. Only few chitinases from this family were reported to have glycosylation such as suspension-cultured bamboo <xref rid="pone.0063779-Kuo1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, XIP-I <xref rid="pone.0063779-Payan2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, mammalian chitinase like proteins (MGP40, HCgp-39, YKL-39) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Mohanty1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Houston1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> protein (IDGF-2) <xref rid="pone.0063779-Varela1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. However, the glycosylation site observed in TCLL is distinct compared to the other related proteins.</p><p>The GH18 family members with chitinase activity, have a conserved catalytic triad of Asp, Glu and Tyr residue in the active site (Asp125, Glu127 and Tyr183 in hevamine), whereas, the corresponding residues observed in TCLL are Ala128, Val130 and Phe186. Therefore, the loss of chitinase activity in TCLL could be due to the mutation of polar residues to non-polar residues in the active site. Some other members of chitinase-like family of proteins also show the lack of chitinase activity with varying mutations of these three essential residues; although some of them show binding to saccharides/polysaccharides in a similar manner as observed in chitinases <xref rid="pone.0063779-Fusetti1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Mohanty1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Kumar3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Hennig1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Payan2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Hennig3" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Varela1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. In TCLL, the evaluation of the chitin binding cavity shows that it is shorter and has a deep pocket like architecture instead of groove and the cavity forming loops are distantly apart, which make it an open cavity. Comparison of TCLL with chitinases and CLPs shows that it has substitution of important residues responsible for chitin binding at chitin binding groove. The biochemical studies show no binding to chitin polymer. The co-crystallization and soaking experiments of TCLL with chitotriose, chitotetraose and chitohexaose were also unsuccessful, which indicated that TCLL might have inappropriate chitin binding cavity. The ITC experiments show that thermograms for the binding interaction of chitobiose, chitotetrose and chitohexose with TCLL were not fitted to the experimental data, which confirmed that TCLL has no binding affitiniy with these sugars. It is noteworthy to state that TCLL has unique cavity shape that may not accommodate the GlcNAc polymer.</p><p>Furthermore, the biochemical studies of TCLL revealed its hemagglutination property and binding to <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine. It indicated that TCLL is a GlcNAc binding chi-lectin. The ligand bound structure of TCLL with GlcNAc further supported that TCLL is GlcNAc specific chi-lectin. The two GlcNAc binding sites (S1 and S2) observed in the TCLL complex structure are novel as compared to other lectins. The binding pattern of S1 and S2 residues with GlcNAc is also different. The interacting residues, architecture of cavity and novel binding mode makes TCLL distinct from other GlcNAc binding lectins. Collectively, it revealed that TCLL is a chitinase like GlcNAc specific lectin. There were also some other similar proteins (tamarinin and chitinase like proteins) reported to have chitinase activity from tamarind seeds <xref rid="pone.0063779-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Datta1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Interestingly, the sequence alignment of these chitinase like proteins from tamarind showed that TCLL has 41% and 39% sequence identity with tamarinin and chitinase, respectively. Moreover, tamarinin and chitinase showed only 63% sequence identity with each other. The intact mass spectrum of TCLL also shows presence of some minor isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063779-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These observations indicate that chitinase and chitinase like proteins are present in tamarind. The presence of several chitinases and chitinase like proteins/genes were also reported in the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0063779-Zhu2" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, malaria mosquito, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0063779-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref> and the red flour beetle, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0063779-Zhu3" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. Therefore, TCLL is an independent protein present with different features in tamarind seeds along with other chitinase/chitinase like proteins.</p><p>The evolution of TCLL might have occurred in tamarind sequentially. This evolutionary pathway most likely involved gene duplication events with mutations at active site leading to TCLL, a GlcNAc binding chi-lectin. The sequence analysis of TCLL, chitinase and tamarinin could be an evidence to the conversion of a plant chitinase into a chi-lectin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0063779.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Similar evidence of analogous evolutionary mechanisms have also been reported earlier in plants <xref rid="pone.0063779-VanDamme2" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, mammals <xref rid="pone.0063779-Bussink1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref> and insects <xref rid="pone.0063779-Zhu2" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. The gene duplication events, followed by mutations at catalytic site of mammalian GH18 family chitinase proteins gave rise to the evolution of broad spectrum chi-lectins <xref rid="pone.0063779-Bussink1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. For example, mammalian chi-lectins HCgp-39 <xref rid="pone.0063779-Houston1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and the murine chitinase like lectin, Ym1 <xref rid="pone.0063779-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> display (&#x003b2;&#x003b1;)<sub>8</sub> barrel fold similar to GH18 chitinases but lacks chitinase activity. HCgp-39 binds chitin fragment and Ym1 shows specificity towards GlcN and heparin/heparan sulfate <xref rid="pone.0063779-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Hitherto the physiological significance of these findings are not clear. A lectin (RobpsCRA) reported from the bark of <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic> shares 50% sequence identity with plant class V chitinases of the GH18 family. This protein also lacks chitinase activity but can interact with high-Man N-glycans. The experimental structure has not been solved, however, molecular modeling has shown the protein to have a TIM barrel domain <xref rid="pone.0063779-VanDamme2" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. Recognition of TCLL as a chi-lectin, which evolved from a chitinase, illustrates acquiring of new activity by losing chitinase activity. Adoption of a new function by inactive chitinases of class III of GH18 family was also reported earlier. For example, XIP-I which is an inactive chitinase was reported to inhibit fungal xylanases of class GH10 and GH11 <xref rid="pone.0063779-Payan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. XAIP is documented as inhibitor of xylanases of family GH11 and &#x003b1;-amylases of family GH13 <xref rid="pone.0063779-Kumar3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. These evolved proteins still had the same fold as that of parent proteins but developed a different site or conformation of interacting loops with ligands. Interestingly, these are not just inactive chitinases but proteins having precise biological functions. So utilization of family GH18 existing scaffold is common to conquer new function, as also exemplified by TCLL. The topology of TCLL also shows structural affirmation of the fact that legume plants are capable of building a domain or site for specific identification of carbohydrate using existing scaffolds. It is notable that no attempts were made to reclassify these chitinase like proteins of GH18 family which has defined functions. The categorization of the CPLs into a specific class having similar role could provide easier ways to study their evolutionary link in depth as their evolutionary relationship and physiological role are still unsolved.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structural report of plant CLPs which binds GlcNAc monomer at the surface of TCLL at two different sites instead of the chitin binding site of GH18 family. The relevant question arises here about the biological role of TCLL in the seeds and the significance of GlcNAc binding. It is documented that several plant lectins serve as plant defence proteins due to their carbohydrate specificity and capability to fight against phytophagous insects and fungi <xref rid="pone.0063779-Rdiger1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. It was also observed that lectins from seeds of Leguminosae family play role in symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria <xref rid="pone.0063779-DeHoff1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063779-Rdiger1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Additionally, in case of TCLL it was also observed that it is degrades during germination as found in most of the seed lectins <xref rid="pone.0063779-Rdiger1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Considering the presence of specific carbohydrate binding site and other observations, it could be conferred that TCLL is not just a seed storage protein. Additional exploration is required to ascertain the physiological function of the GlcNAc binding TCLL. The elucidation of the specific recognition of GlcNAc also needs further investigation.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Atomic Coordinates</title><p>The coordinates and structure factors of refined model for TCLL structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession numbers for TCLL (4B15) and TCLL-GlcNAc (4B16).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0063779.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
