To this end, long-term antibacterial ability of the implant surface is highly desirable to prevent implant-associated infection. In this study, a novel antibacterial coating containing a new antibacterial agent, (Z-)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5H)-furanone loaded poly(L-lactic acid) nanoparticles, was fabricated on microarc-oxidized titanium for this purpose. The antibacterial coating produced a unique inhibition zone against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> throughout a 60-day study period, which is normally long enough to prevent the infection around implants in the early and intermediate stages. The antibacterial rate for adherent <italic>S. aureus</italic> was about 100% in the first 10 days and constantly remained over 90% in the following 20 days. Fluorescence staining of adherent <italic>S. aureus</italic> also confirmed the excellent antibacterial ability of the antibacterial coating. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed an enhanced osteoblast adhesion and proliferation on the antibacterial coating, and more notable cell spread was observed at the early stage. It is therefore concluded that the fabricated antibacterial coating, which exhibits relatively long-term antibacterial ability and excellent biological performance, is a potential and promising strategy to prevent implant-associated infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>microarc oxidation</kwd><kwd>osteoblasts</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Titanium (Ti) implants continue to play essential roles in the repair or replacement of bony tissues that have become diseased or damaged.<xref rid="b1-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, one of the most common and intractable complications during this process is the implant-associated infection,<xref rid="b2-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> which may lead to various serious consequences, such as prolonged hospitalization, implant failure, reoperation, osteomyelitis, amputation, and even death.<xref rid="b3-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although the risk of such infection can be minimized by thorough disinfection and rigorous aseptic operation, the percentage of postoperation infections is still up to 3%.<xref rid="b4-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Once infections occur, bacteria tend to form a biofilm on the implant surface, which protects them from being completely eliminated by antibacterial agents coming from outside.<xref rid="b5-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, fabricating antibacterial coatings on the surface of Ti implants is an effective approach to prevent initial bacterial adhesion around implants, in the pathogenesis of infection.<xref rid="b6-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, most attempts at this have failed to sustain long-term antibacterial effects.<xref rid="b7-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Further, the emerging appearance of insusceptibility of bacteria and drug resistance also encourages the search for novel and more effective antibacterial strategies.<xref rid="b8-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Halogenated furanones, originally extracted from the red alga <italic>Delisea pulchra</italic>, have been proven to possess potent antimicrobial effects against a great number of bacterial species and to inhibit biofilm formation.<xref rid="b9-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> They are structurally similar to bacterial N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), which participate in cell-to-cell communication to control swarming and biofilm formation in various microbial species.<xref rid="b10-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Thus, halogenated furanones acting as AHL antagonists have negative impacts on bacterial colonization.

Subsequent statistical analysis showed that the number of viable cells attached onto MAO-Ti and BBF/PLLA-MAO-Ti was higher than that on the polished surface (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Moreover, BBF/PLLA-MAO-Ti exhibited slightly better cell adhesion than did MAO-Ti, although not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05).

Generally, the osteoblasts were well spread on all the three surfaces. After 1 day of culture, cells grown on the polished cp-Ti and MAO-Ti showed a fusiform morphology, with some filopodia and lamellipodia extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-10-727">Figure 8A and B</xref>). The number of lamellipodia increased slightly on BBF/PLLA-MAO-Ti after 1 day of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-10-727">Figure 8C</xref>). At day 3 of culture, lamellar cells with some filopodia and lamellipodia extensions were observed on the surface of the polished cp-Ti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-10-727">Figure 8D</xref>). The number of cell filopodia and lamellipodia increased significantly after 3-day culture on MAO-Ti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-10-727">Figure 8E</xref>), while well-flattened cells with numerous lamellipodia were observed on BBF/PLLA-MAO-Ti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-10-727">Figure 8F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although Ti implants have been widely and successfully used in both orthopedic and dental clinics, infection prevention remains a continuous challenge for their clinical applications.<xref rid="b25-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Considering the susceptibility of the implant surface to bacterial adhesion, which may cause implant-associated infection, antibacterial coatings have been traditionally designed to prevent the initial bacterial adhesion.<xref rid="b26-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Long-term antibacterial ability is especially significant for implants because of the constant risk of bacterial infection. Halogenated furanones can effectively possess stable antimicrobial activity against a great number of bacteria, meanwhile they are less prone to resistance development. BBF, used in this study, is one of the most active halogenated furanone compounds.<xref rid="b27-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> To achieve the goal of sustained release, we incorporated BBF into PLLA-NPs. Under the SEM, the BBF-PLLA-NPs showed a smooth surface without any pores or cracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-10-727">Figure 1B</xref>). Surface morphology is crucial for microspheres/NPs since in vitro experiments have shown that the initial burst release from a smooth surface is less than that from a rough surface.<xref rid="b28-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Moreover, the particle size (300&#x02013;700 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-10-727">Figure 1A</xref>) was much smaller than the diameter of pores on MAO-Ti (1&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;m) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-10-727">Figure 1C</xref>), which made it possible for the nanospheres to penetrate the pores. In addition to the physical inlay, the cross-linking gelatin could effectively prevent the antibacterial nanospheres from falling off during the insertion of implants. Therefore, this method provides a promising strategy with respect to the fabrication of long-term antibacterial coating on Ti implants.</p><p>The antibacterial coating produced a unique inhibition zone against <italic>S. aureus</italic>, suggesting that only the antibacterial coating possessed the antibacterial ability. The diameter changes of the inhibition zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-10-727">Figure 4</xref>) were almost consistent with the release curve of BBF from the antibacterial coating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-10-727">Figure 1F</xref>). At the first day, the inhibition zone was biggest, due to the initial burst release of small amounts of BBF. From day 2 to day 45, the released BBF maintained at a steady amount with just a small reduction so there were no obvious changes occurring in the inhibition zone. Subsequently, the inhibition zone shrank markedly, with the significant decrease of released BBF, from day 45 to day 60. These antibacterial properties are very meaningful for clinical applications. In the early phase after implantation, the local defense system of the host is severely disturbed by the surgical trauma, which makes this the most dangerous time for infection.<xref rid="b7-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The initial burst release, along with the following sustained release of the BBF at a steady amount, helps to prevent postoperative infection, thus ensuring the normal wound healing during the early stage. After this period, because the surgery site has achieved primary healing and osseointegration will be completed gradually over time, a low level of released BBF, conjugated with the host defense, is sufficient to prevent later-stage infection.<xref rid="b30-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In this context, the release profile of BBF and antibacterial characteristics of the novel antibacterial coating fit the proper criteria for clinical application.</p><p>The AR value of the antibacterial coating for adherent <italic>S. aureus</italic> was about 100% during the first 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-10-727">Figure 5</xref>), which is indicative of the excellent antibacterial ability. Although the AR decreased gradually after 10 days, the AR remained over 90% in the next 20 days. Of note, the specimens were subject to intense bacterial attack from immersion in 1 mL of the bacteria suspension containing 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL and changing of the bacteria suspension daily. These conditions were much harsher than the normal situation in vivo. Therefore, the AR value of the antibacterial coating is expected to be higher under normal conditions. The AR values of MAO-Ti and PLLA-MAO-Ti were in the negative range, which indicated that the adherent bacteria on their surfaces were much more than that on polished cp-Ti. Our results were consistent with the previous findings reported by Wang et al.<xref rid="b31-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Studies have proved that roughened surface can encourage bacterial adhesion.<xref rid="b32-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In our study, the roughness of MAO-Ti and PLLA-MAO-Ti was higher than that of polished cp-Ti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-10-727">Figure 2A</xref>). The viability of bacteria on the specimens also confirmed the potent antibacterial ability of the antibacterial coating. Almost no viable bacteria were seen on the antibacterial coating, while large amounts of viable bacteria were observed on the other three specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-10-727">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The results of cell culture experiments showed that MAO-Ti and the antibacterial coating possessed an enhanced biological performance compared with polished cp-Ti. It is known that the morphology and chemical composition of the implant surface determine its interaction with bone.<xref rid="b33-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The improved biological performance of MAO coating has been confirmed repeatedly in the literature.<xref rid="b17-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> After MAO treatment, a porous surface significantly improved its roughness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-10-727">Figure 2A</xref>). Compared with smooth surface, roughened surface was found to provide osteoblasts with a morphological fixation and thereafter promoted bony ingrowth.<xref rid="b24-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Further, Ca and P ions in electrolytes entered the MAO coating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-10-727">Figure 1C</xref>), thus increasing the bioactive potential.<xref rid="b34-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Hydrophilic surface would improve the cell adhesion and spread to the substrates.<xref rid="b35-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The water contact angle on the MAO-Ti was significantly decreased, which suggested that the surface hydrophilicity was substantially improved.</p><p>However, it was amazing to observe that the antibacterial coating and the MAO-Ti, showed almost the same biological performance. This may be attributed to two main reasons. First, the application of gelatin in the study may have positively affected the biological performance. It is known that gelatin is created through either acid or alkaline hydrolysis of collagen and has conventionally been employed for pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic products.<xref rid="b36-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The hydrolysis process hydrolyzes the amide structures of asparagine or glutamine side chains, generating a high percentage of carboxylic groups and amino groups,<xref rid="b37-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> which increases the hydrophilicity. So in this study, the antibacterial coating showed a higher hydrophilicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-10-727">Figure 2B</xref>). On the other hand, although the BBF-PLLA-NPs were attached in the pores of the MAO coating, the Ca- and P-enriched junction areas among the pores still increased the bioactivity. The Ca/P ratio of the MAO coating was 1.54, very close to that of the hydroxylapatite (1.67), so the bone-like apatite that formed made the surface more bioactive.</p><p>It has been reported that the ideal design of antibacterial coatings on Ti implants should meet certain requirements: (1) the selected antibacterial agent should not promote the development of drug resistance; (2) the release should be sustained; and (3) the biocoatings should be osteoconductive.<xref rid="b38-ijn-10-727" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In our study, BBF was a member of the halogenated furanone compounds, with strong antibacterial ability and low risk of resistance development. This antibacterial coating was able to achieve sustained release of BBF for 60 days and possessed relatively long-term antibacterial effects. Further, the antibacterial coating showed an improved biological activity compared with polished cp-Ti. Taken together, the fabricated antibacterial coating may serve as an ideal approach to prevent implant-associated infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A novel antibacterial coating containing BBF-PLLA-NPs was fabricated on MAO-Ti. The antibacterial coating produced a unique inhibition zone against <italic>S. aureus</italic> throughout the 60-day period, and the AR for adherent bacteria was about 100% in the first 10 days. Results of fluorescence staining of adherent <italic>S. aureus</italic> also confirmed the excellent antibacterial ability of the antibacterial coating. Moreover, the antibacterial coating showed an enhanced osteoblast adhesion, proliferation, and more notable cell spread during the early stage. It can be concluded that use of the fabricated antibacterial coating, with its relatively long-term antibacterial ability and excellent biological performance, may be a potential and promising strategy to prevent implant-associated infection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers
