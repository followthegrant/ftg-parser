The RNAi process is mediated through small, double-stranded RNA molecules called small interfering RNA (siRNA), which specifically trigger the cleavage and subsequent degradation of their target mRNA in a sequence-dependence manner. Hence, synthesis of the protein encoded by those mRNA is prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Recently, RNAi-mediated gene silencing has also been shown to be efficient in mammalian cells, and this has led to the increasing feasibility of RNAi technology for the therapy of certain human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>].</p><p>The efficiency of RNAi mainly depends on the successful delivery of intact siRNA into mammalian cells. However, due to the low stability of siRNA against enzymatic degradation and low permeability across cell membranes, the efficacy of naked siRNA is insufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to develop efficient and convenient methods for siRNA delivery. Until now, viral delivery systems have been used as vectors for genes in many studies due to the advantage of high transfection efficacy, but the use of such delivery systems is limited by endogenous recombination and host immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Moreover, since ontogenesis and mortality have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>], concerns have been raised regarding the safety of using viral vectors in gene therapy trials in humans. In light of these problems, studies of alternative delivery strategies focus on non-viral systems for gene delivery. Recently, cationic copolymers have been demonstrated to be a promising non-viral vector for transfecting nucleotides into various cell types or tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Among these cationic polymers, polyethylenimine (PEI) is an effective gene carrier due to PEI&#x02019;s high charge density and endosomal disruption function, but it is difficult to achieve both the goals of higher transfection efficiency and lower cytotoxicity with PEI homopolymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Various modifications of PEI have been investigated to promote its nucleotide delivery ability as well as to reduce its adverse effects on cell viability. It has been shown that grafting PEI with nonionic hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) could be an effective approach for minimizing the cationic toxicity of PEI and that the cationic toxicity of PEI decreases as its molecular weight decreases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. However, the transfection efficiency of the PEGylated, low molecular weight PEI copolymer is lower than that of 25&#x000a0;kDa PEI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Chitosan (CS) is a non-toxic, biodegradable cationic polymer with relatively low immunogenicity and especially good macro-adhesion. CS has been extensively investigated as a delivery system for therapeutic macromolecules, nucleotides, and protein molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that a new copolymer could be synthesized as a siRNA carrier that would have both the efficient transfection ability of PEI and the biocompatibility of PEG and CS.</p><p>Glaucoma is an eye disease usually associated with increased intraocular pressure that leads to irreversible functional impairment of the optic nerve. Filtration surgery to enhance the drainage of aqueous humor is one of the most effective therapies for glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>], but the therapy&#x02019;s success rate is reduced by blockage of the surgically created drainage channel by subconjunctival scarring that may occur with wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Fibroblasts located in the subconjunctival area play a major role in scar formation after filtration surgery through proliferation, migration, and synthesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Thus, regulating the biological activities of subconjunctival Tenon&#x02019;s capsule fibroblasts (TCFs) during the wound healing process is a major anti-scarring strategy for glaucoma filtration surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) is a transcription factor that is also a positive regulator for fibroblasts, and a protein complex called I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) is a critical regulator of the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Most studies on the role of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in the regulation of cell proliferation have used immortal cell lines (cells capable of continuously renewing themselves). In this study, we investigated whether inhibiting the function of IKK and subsequently blocking the signaling pathway of NF-&#x003ba;B could effectively manipulate the activation and proliferation of TCFs during the scarring process following glaucoma filtration surgery.</p><p>In the study reported here, absorbable, low molecular weight PEI was blocked with polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (mPEG) and grafted onto chitosan. As a result, a novel biodegradable copolymer, CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG), was synthesized. The properties of the CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/siRNA complexes such as particle size, zeta potential, siRNA binding and protection capacity, transfection ability, and cytotoxicity were studied, and IKK&#x00392;-siRNAs were then delivered into human Tenon&#x02019;s capsule fibroblasts (HTFs) using CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) as the vehicle. The expression of IKK&#x003b2; was detected at both the mRNA and protein levels after the transfection of IKK&#x00392;-siRNAs. We also investigated the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and the proliferation of HTFs after the RNA interference process targeting <italic>IKK&#x003b2;</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HeLa (human cervix epithelial carcinoma) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Number CCL-2.1; ATCC, Rockville, MD) and were maintained in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM; Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT), 2&#x000a0;mM of L-glutamine, 100&#x000a0;IU/ml of penicillin, 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of streptomycin, and 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of amphotericin B (all from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 95% humidified atmosphere.</p><p>Tissue explants of human Tenon&#x02019;s capsule were obtained from three male patients (aged 28, 39, and 62 without any topical eye treatment) who had undergone trauma or cataract surgery.

After filtration surgery, fibroblasts are activated by various cytokines and growth factors, eventually resulting in the closure of the drainage channel. Thus, preventing the hyperfunction of fibroblasts is an important strategy for minimizing subconjunctival scarring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Current anti-scarring therapies focus on suppressing the proliferation of fibroblasts through anti-metabolic agents such as mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu). The perioperative administration of such agents has greatly improved the success rate of filtration surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. However, they are associated with several severe complications including keratitis, bleb leakage, chronic hypotony with maculopathy, and endophthalmitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>].</p><p>One goal of our study was to find new physiologic approaches to limiting excessive subconjunctival wound healing that are as effective as antimetabolic agents but have fewer adverse effects. NF-&#x003ba;B is a member of the transcription factor family NF-&#x003ba;B/Rel and was originally described as a necessary element for the transcription of the immunoglobulin &#x003ba;L chain gene in mature B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B has recently proved to be a ubiquitous factor associated with wound healing through the factor&#x02019;s ability to stimulate transcription of various genes involved in the activation of inflammation and cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Thus, we thought the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway may be an essential factor in the regulation of the proliferation of HTFs after glaucoma filtration surgery. NF-&#x003ba;B is bonded with an inhibitor protein, I&#x003ba;B, which sequesters NF-&#x003ba;B in an inactive form in the cytoplasm. A specific I&#x003ba;B kinase, IKK, is a protein complex that contains three subunits, and studies indicate that IKK&#x003b2; is indispensable for the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. IKK phosphorylates I&#x003ba;B and initiates the inhibitor&#x02019;s conjugation to ubiquitin and subsequent degradation by proteasomes. In turn, NF-&#x003ba;B is activated through release from I&#x003ba;B and translocates into the nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. RNAi is commonly used as a powerful tool in biological and biomedical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>] and has been used experimentally to prevent ocular neovascularization and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Researchers in our group have successfully inhibited the proliferation of HTFs through specifically downregulating the expression of <italic>IKK&#x003b2;</italic> using a commercial transfection reagent, Lipofectamine<sup>TM</sup> 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), as a siRNA-delivering vector. However, this cationic liposome compound cannot be used for in vivo investigation in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, another objective of our study was to design and synthesize new compounds that are non-toxic, non-immunogenic, degradable, and efficient for delivering siRNA into HTFs. Among non-viral nucleotide carriers currently under investigation, PEI is one kind of synthetic polymer with a high cationic charge density and a protonable amino group in every third position. PEI can condense and compact DNA into complexes, and the strong proton capacity of PEI allows it to deliver plasmid DNA and oligonucleotides into mammalian cells, both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. However, despite having effective delivery capacity, high molecular weight PEI can not be degraded by body fluids and its high cationic charge density also makes PEI toxic to cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. Therefore, the current trend is toward using modified low molecular weight PEI as a nucleotide delivery reagent, which combines high biocompatibility and reduced cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. PEG, a nonionic hydrophilic polyether, has been widely investigated as a synthesizing graft copolymer with PEI. The nonionic PEG chains can serve as a hydrophilic shell, which makes the new copolymer more soluble and stable, and reduces its non-specific interaction with proteins in physiologic fluids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. One drawback of these copolymers for in vivo application is their lack of transfection efficiency. Chitosan is the name given to a group of linear cationic polymers of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine that are derived from the natural biopolymer, chitin, by alkaline deacetylation. Chitosan has been investigated as a food additive or a wound dressing, and it has been recently considered to be a good candidate for gene delivery because of its reported biocompatibility and biodegradability and its relatively non-toxic nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>].</p><p>In light of these results, we speculated that a novel cationic copolymer combined with PEI, PEG, and CS could be synthesized as a vehicle for delivering siRNA into mammalian cells effectively and safely. In our research, we found that after the grafting reaction, characteristic absorption of PEI and mPEG appeared at 2.5&#x02212;3.3 ppm and 3.5 ppm in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of the copolymer, respectively. CS proton absorption signals (H-2, H-3, 4, 5, 6, 6&#x02019;, 2.8&#x02212;3.8 ppm) also overlapped the PEI and mPEG proton signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). All of the data above prove that the designed CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) copolymer was successfully obtained. The molecular weight of CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) was 2.95&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup>, which was relatively larger than some reported PEI-<italic>alt</italic>-PEG copolymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>] but smaller than generally used PEI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>].</p><p>As indicated in previous reports, the size and shape of nanoparticles play an important role in the delivery process and greatly influence distribution in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. It has been reported that the nano-size of particles is a key prerequisite for cell uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. Similar to plasmid DNA and oligonucleotides, siRNAs are taken up by cells through endocytosis. Therefore, suitable particle size has an important influence on the delivering capacity of a siRNA vector. We investigated the diameter of the CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/siRNA complexes at five different N/P charge ratios and observed that the complexes represented particles with nanometer size (about 200 nm), which were much less than that of 25&#x000a0;kDa PEI. Furthermore, particle size tended to decrease as the N/P charge ratios of the CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/siRNA complexes increased, indicating that the CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) copolymer can condense siRNA into a more compact structure, mainly owing to the net electrostatic repulsive forces between complexes.</p><p>The surface charge of the CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/siRNA complexes is also a major factor influencing transfection efficiency. After the compaction between cationic copolymers and siRNA, the negative charge of siRNA is neutralized and the newly assembled nanoparticles may retain a partial positive surface charge to help siRNA pass through the cell membrane and escape the endolysosomes. However, the excessive positive charge of PEI homopolymers may subsequently lead to hyperpermeability of the membrane, resulting in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. The density of the surface charge is reflected by measured zeta potential values, and as we have shown, an initial negative value of zeta potential (&#x02212;2.4&#x000a0;mV) was detected when the complexes formed at an N/P ratio of 1, which means that siRNA could not be completely compacted under this condition. Then, the positive surface charge of the complexes exhibited an increasing trend corresponding to the rising N/P ratio, indicating that more and more siRNAs were compacted with CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) and the negative charge was neutralized. But the zeta potential of the CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/siRNA complexes at each N/P ratio that we measured was still lower than that of the 25&#x000a0;kDa PEI/siRNA complexes. The reason for this result is probably consistent with the reason Petersen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>] regarding copolymer-based DNA complexes, which was that the shielding effect of neutral components on the PEI part of the copolymer produces a relatively low zeta potential. </p><p>Condensation ability is one requirement for a siRNA carrier. An optimal binding degree between CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) and siRNA can achieve more efficient delivering capacity. If the complexes are formed efficiently, all siRNAs are bound to the copolymers to form nanoparticles. Hence, the complexes become relatively large and remain immobile in the loading well with no bands of free siRNA apparent. We observed that the migration of siRNA was retarded to different degrees in accordance with the increasing N/P ratio. Complete retardation occurs at an N/P ratio of 10, which means the CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/siRNA complexes are completely formed. The complete complexes of 600&#x000a0;kDa PEI and siRNA cannot be found even at an N/P ratio of 50 (data not shown), which indicates that the condensation ability of CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) is better than low molecular weight PEI. It was also detected that the band of siRNA at an N/P ratio of 20 demonstrated much lower fluorescence intensity than that of the band at the N/P ratio of 10. This decrease in fluorescence was also observed by other experiments executed on DNA bands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. The reason for this phenomenon is that the measured fluorescence is attributed to the intercalated ethidium bromide in siRNA. When the condensation degree between siRNA and the cationic copolymer gradually increases, ethidium bromide cannot intercalate with siRNA anymore. Therefore, the fluorescence intensity of the bands decreases accordingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>].</p><p>The main hindrance to the use of RNAi as a therapeutic tool for human diseases is that the unprotected dsRNA or siRNA will be rapidly degraded by either nucleases in serum or the endosomal compartment of cells. The enzymatic degradation of siRNA is accompanied by a rapid decline in biological activity and therapeutic efficiency. Therefore, the potential of this technology as a clinical therapy method depends largely on the improvement of siRNA vectors&#x02019; protection ability against enzymatic degradation. We found that after incubation in 10% FBS for 24 h, 64% of siRNA was protected from degradation at the N/P ratio of 20 whereas only 0.7% naked siRNA remained intact. We attributed these results to two factors. First, PEG not only has the reported ability to stabilize the structure of nanospheres, but PEG can also protect siRNA from being attacked by nucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>]. Second, it has been reported that chitosan can effectively protect DNA from nuclease degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>]. The CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) we have synthesized has both PEG and CS elements and can provide efficient protection for siRNA against enzymatic degradation.</p><p>Low toxicity is also a major requirement for an siRNA delivery system. The cytotoxicity of cationic copolymers is mainly caused by the aggregation of nanoparticles on the cell membrane, impairing its normal function. In addition, the excessive positive surface charge of nanoparticles may also interfere with critical intracellular processes of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. It has been shown that chitosan salts and chitosan derivatives are less toxic than PEI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>]. However, no data have been reported regarding the cytotoxic analysis of a synthetic cationic copolymer on human Tenon&#x02019;s capsule fibroblasts. Therefore, we explored the influence of different concentrations of CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) and 25&#x000a0;kDa PEI on the cell viability of HTFs. CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) showed much less cytotoxicity than 25&#x000a0;kDa PEI, which is consistent with what had been obtained by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>] in tests of HeLa and HepG2 cells. The cell viabilities of the HTFs decreased drastically as the concentrations of 25&#x000a0;kDa PEI increased whereas the pure CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) copolymer did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity at any determined concentration. We hypothesize that the relatively low cytotoxicity of CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) could be explained from two aspects. First, the copolymer can be degraded into CS, PEG, and low molecular weight PEI units in cells, all of which can be easily eliminated by excretion pathways, thus making this copolymer relatively less toxic than 25&#x000a0;kDa PEI. Second, PEG reduces toxicity by substituting the amino groups of PEI, which are the main toxic moieties of the copolymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, after compacting with siRNA, both the CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/siRNA and 25&#x000a0;kDa PEI/siRNA complexes showed much lower cytotoxicity, which is due to the neutralization effect of the negative charge of siRNA on the positive charge of the pure polymers.</p><p>The transfection efficiency of the CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/siRNA complexes was assessed at various N/P ratios in HeLa cells and HTFs. This is mainly because the N/P ratio is directly related to the size, surface charge, compaction degree, and serum-resistant capacity of the CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/siRNA complexes, all of which can affect delivery efficiency. At the N/P ratio of 20, CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) outperformed the highest transfection rate in both HeLa cells and HTFs, which can be explained by the appropriate particle size and surface charge as well as the excellent stability of the CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/siRNA complexes. The transfection rate was a little lower than that of 25&#x000a0;kDa PEI at the same N/P ratio partly because of the shielding effect of mPEG on the positive charge of PEI. We also found that both CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) and 25&#x000a0;kDa PEI showed a lower transfection rate in HTFs than in HeLa cells, which may be attributed to a cell line dependency of the cationic polymer&#x02019;s delivery ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. From our results, we can conclude that PEI with low molecular weight grafted onto CS avoids the cytotoxicity of high molecular weight PEI. Meanwhile, mPEG improves the stability of CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/siRNA complexes, and as a result, the CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/siRNA nanoparticles can offer a substantial gene silencing effect with minimal side effects. Moreover, many factors governing the transfection efficiency of cationic copolymers need to be investigated in future studies such as the presence of serum and the pH value of solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>], and ligands will be conjugated to the copolymers to achieve receptor-mediated endocytosis and potentially to target cells or tissues.</p><p>A special siRNA targeting <italic>IKK&#x003b2;</italic> gene was successfully compacted with CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) and effectively delivered into HTFs. Subsequently, both the mRNA and protein levels of <italic>IKK&#x003b2;</italic> were suppressed, and the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B was inhibited in turn. Finally, IKK&#x00392;-siRNA-mediated blocking of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway resulted in repression of the proliferation of HTFs, and cells transfected with IKK&#x00392;-siRNA showed growth inhibition up to 42%. All of these findings suggest that blocking the signaling pathway of NF-&#x003ba;B could be an effective way to manipulate the scar formation process by downregulating the proliferation of HTFs. This novel method based on nanotechnology and RNAi could represent a remarkable anti-scarring therapeutic approach for glaucoma filtration surgery. Follow-up studies will focus on the in vivo application of CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG)/IKK&#x00392;-siRNA complexes.</p><p>We have reported on the synthesis and characterization of a novel cationic copolymer, CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG). We found it to have powerful siRNA binding and protection ability, relatively high transfection efficiency, and low cytotoxicity, making CS-<italic>g</italic>-(PEI-<italic>b</italic>-mPEG) a suitable delivery vector for transfecting siRNA into cells. We observed that siRNA targeting <italic>IKK&#x003b2;</italic> was successfully transfected into human Tenon&#x02019;s capsule fibroblasts in vitro, and RNAi processes against the expression of <italic>IKK&#x003b2;</italic> can subsequently inhibit the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and in turn, the proliferation of HTFs. Our results indicate the potential for a safe and effective strategy for preventing scar formation after glaucoma filtration surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the National Basic Research Program of China (&#x0201c;973&#x0201d; program, Number 2007CB512207) and the special research foundation for doctor disciplines at colleges, the Ministry of Education, China (Number 20060558035).
