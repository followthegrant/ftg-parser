While recent transcriptomic profiling studies have helped define human NP cell phenotype, it remains unclear how expression of these markers is influenced by ageing or degeneration. Furthermore, cells of the NP are thought to derive from the notochord, although adult NP lacks identifiable notochordal (NC) cells. This study aimed to confirm expression of previously identified NP and NC marker genes in adult human NP cells from a range of ages and degenerate states. Importantly, using gene expression analysis (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;60) and immunohistochemistry (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;56) the study demonstrates expression of NP markers FoxF1, Pax-1, keratin-8/18, carbonic anhydrase-12, and NC markers brachyury, galectin-3 and CD24 in cells of the NP irrespective of age or degeneration. Our immunohistochemical data, combined with flow cytometry (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) which identified a small number of CA12<sup>+</sup>Gal3<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> cells, suggests the possible presence of a sub-population of cells with an NC-like phenotype in adult NP tissue. These findings suggest that the NP contains a heterogeneous population of cells, which may possess varied phenotypic and functional profiles and thus warrant further investigation to improve our understanding of IVD homeostasis and repair.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately 70% of individuals in developed societies suffer from low back pain (LBP) and neck pain at some point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The socioeconomic impact of LBP amounts to over &#x000a3;12 billion in the UK alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and whilst the underlying pathologies of these are multifactorial, degeneration of the lumbar and cervical intervertebral discs (IVDs) have been directly correlated to the development of these conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Degeneration of the IVD is a progressive age-related disorder. Symptomatic relief may be achieved utilising current therapeutic strategies; however such strategies fail to address the underlying pathogenesis and aberrant cell biology and thus are ineffective for long-term treatment of this disease. The research community therefore continues to strive to improve understanding of the cellular and molecular biology of the healthy and degenerate disc in order to inform development of novel regenerative strategies.</p><p>In order for effective regenerative strategies to be developed, it is essential that the phenotype of cells intended for recapitulation is fully elucidated. Cells of the adult human NP have routinely been likened to articular chondrocyte (AC) cells, with regards to both phenotype and morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, clear distinctions in the ECM produced by AC and NP cells have been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, which has implications for the hydration state and stiffness of the tissue. This highlights the importance of accurate profiling of the NP cell phenotype and a number of microarray studies have been conducted in recent years in different species with a view to identifying a panel of marker genes distinguishing NP cells from other cell types, predominantly AC cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Our studies using both human and bovine NP and AC cells have identified a number of differentially expressed genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, including forkhead box F1 (FOXF1), paired box 1 (PAX1), carbonic anhydrase 12 (CA12) and the keratins (KRT) 8, 18 and 19. These studies, along with those by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> have led to a consensus paper detailing a potential panel of human NP marker genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Importantly, however, studies to detail the NP phenotype at protein level are limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and thus further validation of newly identified NP markers at the protein level needs to be conducted. Crucially, localising the expression of NP marker proteins will allow for the elucidation of whether all, or only a subset of cells express these proteins.</p><p>One of the most interesting findings of the previous microarray investigations was the expression of previously described notochordal (NC) cell markers in cells of the adult human NP. KRT8, KRT18, KRT19, and brachyury (T) are expressed in the developing notochord, which is considered to be the developmental origin of the mature NP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. When compared to AC and AF cells, these genes were highly expressed in NP cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, isolation of separate bovine NP and NC cell populations by size filtration with subsequent analysis of cellular gene expression identified similarities between the two cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This is important as it is suggestive of a common ontogeny between NP and NC cells, or may be indicative of a subset of NP cells within the adult human NP that are phenotypically NC cell-like. Furthermore, analysis of cells isolated from non-degenerate human NP tissue and subsequently immortalised revealed NP cellular subpopulations at differing stages of maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, inferring that defining the NP cell phenotype requires an understanding of the changes in marker expression in development, ageing and degeneration.</p><p>The controversy regarding the phenotype and ontogeny of adult human NP cells described above highlights many unanswered questions, particularly regarding the heterogeneity of the adult NP cell population. As such we hypothesise that at least a proportion of cells present in the adult human NP are notochordally derived and that these cells persist irrespective of age or degeneration. Thus the aims of this investigation were: firstly to validate our previously described novel NP marker genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> in a large cohort of adult human specimens, and correlate levels of gene expression with age and severity of tissue degeneration; and secondly, to analyse expression of novel NP and NC cell marker proteins in cells of the adult human NP in order to ascertain whether expression is noted in all cells or a subset of NP cells, also correlating this expression to age and degenerative score.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Novel NP and notochordal marker gene expression is maintained through age and degeneration</title><p>The gene expression levels of novel NP cell and notochordal cell marker genes were first assessed in NP cells of the IVD sample cohort. Gene expression analysis identified expression of all genes analysed in all samples. When comparing expression between NP cells from cervical and lumbar discs, only KRT8 and T demonstrated a significant difference, with KRT8 being higher in cervical NP and T being higher in lumbar NP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a and b</xref>). No significant regional variation was identified for any other NP or notochordal marker gene and thus subsequent analysis was performed on the entire cohort of disc samples.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Novel NP and notochordal cell marker gene expression in adult human NP cells.

These cells were localised in small clusters within the tissue and were identified as NC remnants by their large, round cell morphology which was distinct from that of mature NP cells.

The sustained expression of both CHRD and NOG genes by adult human NP cells confirms previous findings which demonstrated their expression by both human NP and AF cells and may highlight a role for these molecules as BMP antagonists in preventing ossification of the disc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, the previously identified expression by AF cells, combined with the low levels of expression identified here meant these genes were not studied further.</p><p>Importantly this study demonstrates expression of notochordal marker genes in the adult human NP, which are maintained throughout ageing and degeneration, suggesting a notochordal origin for at least a proportion of cells present within the adult disc. However, one of the limitations of gene transcript analysis is the global view of expression that is obtained, meaning it is not possible to determine whether expression is ubiquitous or specific to subsets of cells. Here, confirmation of expression at protein level and localisation of immunopositive cells within adult human IVD tissue has highlighted that expression of these novel NP and notochordal markers is in fact heterogeneous.</p><p>In the cohort of samples used in this study 22 contained AF tissue. When comparing NP and AF regions all novel NP marker proteins, except FoxF1, demonstrated significantly higher numbers of immunopositive cells in the NP compared to the AF. Interestingly we first identified FoxF1 as an IVD-specific, rather than NP-specific cell marker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and thus the relatively high numbers of immunopositive NP and AF cells is unsurprising. The findings also confirm previous studies demonstrating expression of FoxF1 by AF cells at both the gene and protein level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. While significantly lower than NP, a relatively high proportion of AF cells displayed positivity for Pax-1 and carbonic anhydrase-12, supporting previous evidence of expression in human AF cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Conversely keratin-8 and -19 expression was absent from AF cells, with &#x0003c;2% of AF cells demonstrating positivity for keratin-18, highlighting the specificity of keratins as NP-specific markers.</p><p>Immunolocalisation analysis of our novel NP markers within the adult human NP demonstrated no significant change in the number of FoxF1 or Pax1 immunopositive cells with ageing or degeneration. However, there was a significant increase in carbonic anhydrase-12 immunopositivity with degeneration, in agreement with previous work where the most intense staining was found to be in the most degenerate tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p>This is the first investigation into NC marker expression within the adult human NP in a large sample cohort and one of the most pertinent findings of this study was the expression of notochordal marker genes and persistence of a subset of cells which express notochordal markers in adult degenerate NP tissues. Decreases in keratin-8, keratin-18 and keratin-19 protein expression have previously been correlated with ageing in human discs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>; although no keratin-19 expression was detected in the present study. The previous investigation used a pan-keratin antibody for assessment of keratin-19 staining, and given the results presented here, likely represents expression of keratin-8 rather than -19, which would support data from another study where keratin-19 protein becomes undetectable shortly after adolescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p>The literature regarding the notochordal marker brachyury protein expression in adult NP is conflicting. Immunonegativity has been reported in adult human NP cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, whilst conversely Western blot analysis has revealed expression within adult human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Significantly our data demonstrates immunopositivity for brachyury in a large cohort of adult human NP cells, which is maintained with ageing and degeneration, although both age- and degeneration-related decreases were seen. We have also shown the presence of galectin-3 and a small number of CD24 positive cells within the adult human NP, indicative of an NC-like cell population existing within the mature NP. Galectin-3 and CD24 have previously been localised to rodent and human NP cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. While galectin-3 has previously been reported as lost with ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and CD24 not correlated to age or degenerative score in human tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, our data suggest that expression of an NC-like phenotype is maintained in a small number of adult NP cells in ageing and degeneration of the adult human IVD.</p><p>To confirm presence of cells with an NC-like phenotype within the adult human NP, we analysed co-expression of the ubiquitously expressed NP marker carbonic anhydrase-12, with the NC markers galectin-3, brachyury and CD24. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed high cell positivity for carbonic anhydrase-12 and galectin-3, with 98% of adult human NP cells being CA12<sup>+</sup>Gal3<sup>+</sup>, supporting our immunolocalisation studies. Further analysis also revealed a smaller population of CA12<sup>+</sup>Gal3<sup>+</sup>T<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> adult human NP cells from surgically isolated samples across a range of patient ages, supporting our growing evidence that at least a sub-population of adult human NP cells are notochordally derived and retain notochordal marker expression.</p><p>The persistence of cells with an NC-like phenotype, but with an NP-like morphology, within the adult human NP is still a matter of debate, with many recent studies reporting the presence of cell sub-populations within the NP. These include the possible identification of MSC-like cell populations within the adult IVD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and TIE2<sup>+</sup>GD2<sup>+</sup> NP cells capable of multi-lineage differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Taken together, these studies indicate that a proportion of IVD cells possess a progenitor-like phenotype, which is likely diminished or rendered ineffective with progressing age or degeneration. However, none of these studies investigated the possibility of an NC cell sub-population within adult NP tissue. In humans, morphologically-distinct NC cells disappear from the NP with ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that NC cells confer some protective effect over NP cells through maintenance of IVD integrity and tissue ECM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and through protection from degradation and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Thus, our NC-marker<sup>+</sup> cell sub-population may persist within the tissue as an endogenous attempt at tissue repair, protecting the NP from the effects of early tissue degeneration. However this is purely speculative at present and requires further investigation by isolation of distinct cell populations. Importantly, the identification of NC marker expression within adult human NP cells supports the notion that at least a proportion of cells of the adult human NP are notochordally-derived<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, rather than as a result cellular infiltration from surrounding tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Further analysis of these putative NC-like cells will help evolve our understanding of IVD homeostasis and repair, as well as provide a source of cells for future therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Tissue acquisition and processing</title><p>Adult human IVD specimens (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) were obtained with informed written consent from patients undergoing disc surgery for treatment of IVD degeneration with National Research Ethics Service committee approval (08/H1010/36), and all experimental protocols were performed in accordance with National Research Ethics Service and University of Manchester guidelines and regulations.
