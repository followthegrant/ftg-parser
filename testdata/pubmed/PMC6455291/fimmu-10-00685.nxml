Although a well-described phenomenon, research to date has only analyzed blood samples acquired post-hospital admission, and the mechanisms that initiate compromised neutrophil function post-injury are therefore poorly understood. Here, we analyzed pre-hospital blood samples acquired from 62 adult trauma patients (mean age 44 years, range 19&#x02013;95 years) within 1 h of injury (mean time to sample 39 min, range 13&#x02013;59 min). We found an immediate impairment in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) generation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation, which persisted into the acute post-injury phase (4&#x02013;72 h). Reduced NET generation was accompanied by reduced reactive oxygen species production, impaired activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and a reduction in neutrophil glucose uptake and metabolism to lactate. Pre-treating neutrophils from healthy subjects with mitochondrial-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), whose circulating levels were significantly increased in our trauma patients, reduced NET generation. This mtDAMP-induced impairment in NET formation was associated with an N-formyl peptide mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a negative regulator of aerobic glycolysis and NET formation. Indeed, activation of AMPK via treatment with the AMP-mimetic AICAR significantly reduced neutrophil lactate production in response to PMA stimulation, a phenomenon that we also observed for neutrophils pre-treated with mtDAMPs. Furthermore, the impairment in NET generation induced by mtDAMPs was partially ameliorated by pre-treating neutrophils with the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Taken together, our data demonstrate an immediate trauma-induced impairment in neutrophil anti-microbial function and identify mtDAMP release as a potential initiator of acute post-injury neutrophil dysfunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>neutrophil extracellular traps</kwd><kwd>trauma</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial-derived DAMPs</kwd><kwd>immune suppression</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="9931"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Major injury induces significant phenotypic and functional remodeling of the peripheral neutrophil pool, attributable in part to the emergence into circulation of immature granulocytes (IGs) and highly mature neutrophil subsets (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Alongside changes in the surface expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), immediate and prolonged impairments in phagocytosis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and chemotaxis (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) have been reported for neutrophils isolated from critically-injured patients. Whilst understanding of trauma-induced changes in neutrophil intracellular bactericidal function is well-developed, few studies have investigated the impact of injury on the extracellular defensive mechanisms of neutrophils and how soon after injury, any compromise occurs.</p><p>Comprised of a DNA backbone decorated with granular and cytosol-derived peptides and enzymes, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are an extracellular anti-microbial defense mechanism deployed to prevent pathogen dissemination (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Studies that have examined NET generation post-injury have reported an increase in <italic>ex vivo</italic> NET formation by resting neutrophils (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), a hyperactivity that may reflect their <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure to high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) and interleukin (IL)-33, two NET-inducing alarmins whose circulating concentrations are significantly increased post-injury (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, in terms of stimulus-induced NET generation, comparable (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), or reduced (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) NET production in response to stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) has been reported post- trauma. Of these studies, only one performed quantitative analysis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), and neither study that reported a post-injury reduction in NET formation investigated the mechanism(s) responsible (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Activation of three non-redundant molecular processes underpin PMA-induced NET generation. Produced by the multi-subunit enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, ROS generation is essential for the process of chromatin decondensation that precedes NET release (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Occuring prior to (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) or following (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) ROS production, activation of the mitogen activated protein kinases p38 and extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), triggers NET formation by inhibiting caspase activation and increasing expression of the pro-survival protein Mcl-1, thus promoting NET production over the induction of apoptosis (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Finally, glycolysis is a fundamental metabolic requirement for PMA-induced NET formation, with the uptake and breakdown of extracellular glucose a necessity for the process of DNA expulsion (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Trauma-associated tissue damage results in the release into the circulation of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), a collection of cytosolic, mitochondrial and nuclear-derived proteins, and DNA (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Whilst renowned for their role in immune activation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), data are emerging that suggests mitochondrial-derived DAMPs (mtDAMPs), which include N-formylated peptides and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), possess immune tolerising properties. For instance, it has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> that monocytes pre-exposed to mtDNA (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and neutrophils pre-treated with whole mtDAMP preparations (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) exhibit impaired cytokine production and calcium mobilization respectively upon secondary stimulation. Furthermore, a significant reduction in stimulus-induced ROS production and transmigration was reported for neutrophils pre-exposed to bacterial-derived or synthetic N-formylated peptides (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), both of which signal through the same formyl peptide receptor (FPR) as mitochondrial-derived formyl peptides. Based on these observations, the concept of mtDAMP-induced tolerance has been coined and proposed to be a potential mechanistic explanation for the state of peripheral neutrophil dysfunction that develops in the aftermath of major trauma (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>Here, in a prospective observational study of trauma patients, we have performed for the first time a quantitative assessment of NET production during the pre-hospital, ultra-early (&#x02264;60 min), and acute (4&#x02013;72 h) post-injury phases, and assessed the impact that major injury has on the molecular processes and signaling pathways that underpin PMA-induced NET generation. Furthermore, based on the emerging concept of mtDAMP-induced tolerance, we have investigated whether pre-exposing neutrophils isolated from healthy subjects to mtDAMPs <italic>in vitro</italic> results in altered NET generation upon secondary stimulation with PMA and the mechanisms involved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design and Setting</title><p>This manuscript presents data acquired from subjects enrolled into the Brain Biomarkers after Trauma Study, an ongoing prospective longitudinal observational study of adult trauma patients conducted at a single Major Trauma Center site in the UK (University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham). Ethical approval for the study was granted by the North Wales Research Ethics Committee&#x02013;West (REC reference: 13/WA/0399, Protocol Number: RG_13-164).</p><p>Patient enrolment began in the pre-hospital setting, where on a 24/7 basis between March 2016 and October 2018, emergency care teams acquired blood samples from adult trauma patients (&#x02265;18 years) with a suspected injury severity score (ISS) &#x02265;8 within 1 h of injury (defined as the time of phone call to emergency services). In the pre-hospital setting, blood samples were not taken from patients who were deemed unlikely to survive transportation to hospital. Post admission, patients were excluded if they were aged &#x0003c;18 years, if pre-hospital blood samples had been acquired &#x0003e;1 h post-injury and if clinical assessments confirmed either an ISS &#x0003c;8 or a previous diagnosis of neuro-degenerative disease. No patients received blood products in the pre-hospital setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Capacity and Consent</title><p>Due to the nature of injuries sustained, patients were unlikely to provide informed consent for their participation at the time of study enrolment. Consequently, patient recruitment was performed under the guidance of the Mental Health Capacity Act 2005 for research in emergency situations and the Declaration of Helsinki. For patients who lacked capacity, an agreement for study participation was sought from a legal consultee (family member or clinician not directly involved in the study), with written consent obtained from the patient once they regained capacity. In instances where the patient did not regain capacity, data were retained in accordance with the agreement of the legal consultee.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood Sampling</title><p>In the pre-hospital environment, peripheral venous blood samples were acquired during the intravenous cannulation of patients or by venepuncture. Once taken, blood tubes were stored at room temperature (RT) until arrival at hospital, where analysis began within 1 h by a single laboratory researcher on a 24/7 basis. Additional blood samples were acquired 4&#x02013;12 and 48&#x02013;72 h post-injury. At all three time points, blood samples were collected into BD Vacutainers&#x000ae; (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, z-serum clotting activator or 1/10 volume of 3.2% trisodium citrate. Full blood counts were performed using a Sysmex XN-1000 hematology analyser (Sysmex UK, Milton Keynes, UK) that measures a white cell differential and IGs, which are defined as promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes. The analyser uses fluorescence dyes that label intracellular DNA and RNA, with the intensity of the fluorescence signal directly proportional to the nucleic acid content of the cell. Due to their higher RNA content, IGs are discriminated from mature neutrophils via their stronger fluorescence signal. Daily internal quality control measurements (XN check, Sysmex UK) and monthly external quality control samples (UKNEQAS, Watford, UK) ensured instrument performance.</p><p>Sixty-seven adults (mean age 31 years, range 18&#x02013;80) served as a cohort of healthy controls (HCs). HCs were volunteers who were not taking any regular medication for a diagnosed illness and did not have an acute episode of infection prior to the time of sampling. The recruitment of HCs was carried out in accordance with the ethical approval granted by the University of Birmingham Research Ethics Committee (Ref: ERN_12-1184) with written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of mtDAMPs and mtDNA</title><p>MtDNA and mtDAMPs were prepared from mitochondria isolated from the K562 tumor cell line (ATCC&#x000ae;, Teddington, Middlesex, UK) as described previously (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). MtDNA concentration and protein content within mtDAMPs were determined by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Paisley, UK) and preparations stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C prior to use.</p></sec><sec><title>Neutrophil Isolation and Treatment</title><p>Neutrophils were isolated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation (Scientific Lab Supplies, Nottingham, UK) with cell purity, which was routinely &#x02265;99%, determined using a Sysmex XN-1000 hematology analyser.

Prior to inclusion in transmigration, lactate and ROS assays, neutrophils were pelleted, supernatants removed, and cells resuspended in specified media. To inhibit FPR-1 signaling, neutrophils were treated for 60 min (37&#x000b0;C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) with 2.5 &#x003bc;M cyclosporin H (CsH; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or vehicle control, prior to mtDAMP stimulation. For compound C experiments, neutrophils were treated for 60 min with 200 &#x003bc;M compound C (Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle control prior to mtDAMP and PMA treatment. To inhibit calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases (CaMKKs), neutrophils were incubated for 60 min (37&#x000b0;C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) with 2.5 &#x003bc;M STO-609 (Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle control prior to mtDAMP treatment.

Post-stimulation, supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 2,200 x g for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C, after which the DNA content of cell-free supernatants was analyzed. Briefly, 100 &#x003bc;l aliquots of cell-free supernatant were incubated with 1 &#x003bc;M SYTOX Green dye (Life Technologies) for 10 min at RT. Fluorescence was measured using a BioTek Synergy 2 fluorometric plate reader (NorthStar Scientific Ltd, Sandy, UK) with excitation and emission set at 485 and 528 nm respectively. In our trauma-based studies, DNA quantification was performed using a &#x003bb;-DNA standard curve (Fisher Scientific) with PMA-induced NET generation presented as DNA concentration after subtracting the readings obtained from untreated controls. For mtDAMP experiments, background fluorescence values acquired from SYTOX Green staining of mtDAMPs in the absence of neutrophils were subtracted from test readings, with NET production expressed as a fold increase above untreated controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Visualization of NETs by Fluorescence Microscopy</title><p>2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> neutrophils in phenol red free or phenol red containing RPMI + GPS or glucose free RPMI-1640 media supplemented with GPS were seeded onto glass coverslips and incubated for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C/5% CO2 to allow for cell adherence. Following a 3 h stimulation with 25 nM PMA (37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO2), samples were fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO2), washed three times in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich).

This defect persisted into the acute post-injury phase (4&#x02013;72 h) and was accompanied by impaired ROS production, MAPK activation and a reduction in both glucose uptake and breakdown. Furthermore, we showed that the trauma-induced reduction in NET formation could be replicated <italic>in vitro</italic> by treating neutrophils isolated from healthy donors with mtDAMPs prior to secondary stimulation. Thus, our data provides support for the emerging concept of mtDAMP-induced tolerance, where the post-injury release of mtDAMPs into the circulation has been proposed to contribute to the neutrophil dysfunction that develops in the aftermath of traumatic injury (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of secondary stimulation, neutrophils obtained from patients within minutes, but not hours, of injury released significantly more DNA into culture supernatants than neutrophils isolated from healthy controls. This immediate trauma-induced increase in basal NET generation is in agreement with the findings of our previous trauma-based study, where in pre-hospital plasma samples, we reported the presence of citrullinated histone H3, a protein that decorates the nuclear DNA backbone of NETs (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Thus, taken together, our results suggest that neutrophils are immediately exposed to NET-inducing stimuli post-injury. Supporting this proposal, data presented here and in our previous manuscript have shown serum concentrations of known NET inducers, which include TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-8, IL-33, and HMGB-1 are all significantly elevated within minutes of injury (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Of these agonists, the immediate release of HMGB-1 may be particularly pertinent given that within 60 min of <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture, neutrophils stimulated with this nuclear-derived DAMP have been shown to generate NETs (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Moreover, as HMGB-1 induced NET formation is independent of ROS generation by NADPH oxidase (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), immediate exposure to this DAMP could explain our observation of enhanced <italic>ex vivo</italic> NET formation by neutrophils isolated from pre-hospital blood samples that exhibited no difference in basal ROS production when compared to neutrophils from HCs. In terms of stimulus-induced NET formation, this is the first study to show quantitatively that trauma results in reduced NET generation to PMA stimulation. We confirmed this impairment, which was evident at all three sampling time points, by fluorescent microscopy, with our images akin to those presented in a previous study that reported a qualitative post-injury reduction in PMA-induced NET production in a much smaller cohort of trauma patients (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>The processes that mediate PMA-induced NET generation are well-defined, with prominent roles assigned to ROS generation, MAPK activation, glucose uptake and glycolysis (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Across our sampling time points, we observed defects in each of these processes, suggesting that multiple impairments rather than a single aberration underlie the post-injury reduction in NET formation. Whilst our data demonstrating a trauma-induced impairment in neutrophil ROS production has been described previously (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), we are the first to report a post-trauma reduction in MAPK activation, glucose uptake, and metabolism by neutrophils in response to <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation. Aside from NET production, other anti-microbial mechanisms of neutrophils utilize glucose. For instance, chemotaxis requires the uptake of exogenous glucose (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), whilst breakdown of endogenous glucose is important for stimulus-induced ROS production and phagocytosis (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Interestingly, as reported here for NET generation, these three defense strategies have all been shown in <italic>ex vivo</italic> assays to be significantly impaired following trauma (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Thus, the injury-induced reduction we have demonstrated in glucose uptake and metabolism may be a mechanism underlying many facets of post-trauma neutrophil dysfunction. Aside from the changes we found in neutrophil signaling and metabolism, trauma patients presented at all three time points with elevated circulating levels of IGs. Shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to exhibit impaired NET production upon secondary stimulation (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), the immediate and persistent presence of immature cells offers another potential mechanistic explanation for the trauma-induced reduction in NET formation.</p><p>Suggesting that traumatic injury modulates cell metabolism, we demonstrated a post-trauma elevation in lactate production by resting neutrophils, an observation that is in agreement with the findings of a previous study. In a cohort of polytrauma patients, Oehler et al. reported a higher glycolytic activity, relative to HCs, for neutrophils isolated from subjects between 48 and 120 h post-injury, an enhancement they attributed to increased expression and activity of pyruvate kinase, a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Here, we confirmed that traumatic injury induces increased expression of pyruvate kinase and showed that this is accompanied by increased expression of lactate dehydrogenase A. Whilst up-regulation of lactate dehydrogenase A, which converts pyruvate to lactate, has been described in transcriptomic analysis of whole blood leukocytes isolated from critically-ill patients (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), this is the first study to demonstrate increased protein expression of lactate dehydrogenase in neutrophils post-injury.</p><p>Accompanying the impairment we observed in <italic>ex vivo</italic> NET formation was a significant trauma-induced elevation in the circulating levels of the mitochondrial-derived N-formylated peptide ND6. In a recent study, suppressed chemotactic responses toward CXCL1 and LTB<sub>4</sub> were reported for neutrophils pre-treated with synthetic ND6 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), a finding that mirrored results of previous studies where prior exposure to bacterial-derived N-formylated peptides or ND6 respectively was shown to reduce neutrophil migration and ROS production upon secondary stimulation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Adding to this growing body of literature that suggests a tolerising effect for mitochondrial-derived peptides on neutrophil function, we demonstrated that neutrophils pre-treated with whole mtDAMP preparations, but not purified mtDNA, exhibited significantly reduced NET production following PMA stimulation.</p><p>A striking observation of our NET based assays was that despite an absence of NET production, mtDAMP pre-treated neutrophils lost their distinctive multi-lobed nuclear morphology upon PMA challenge. Interestingly, chromatin decondensation in the absence of DNA release was recently reported for PMA stimulated neutrophils pre-treated with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-glucose (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Using lactate as a readout of glycolytic activity, we measured significantly reduced lactate concentrations in the supernatants of mtDAMP pre-treated neutrophils stimulated with PMA, demonstrating that exposure to mtDAMPs influences the metabolism of immune cells.</p><p>We found that exposing neutrophils to mtDAMPs resulted in activation of the serine/threonine protein kinase AMPK. In T cells, increases in intracellular calcium levels promote AMPK phosphorylation through activation of CaMKKs (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Our data demonstrating a significant reduction in mtDAMP-induced phosphorylation of AMPK in neutrophils pre-treated with the selective CAMMK inhibitor STO-506 indicates this signaling pathway is also activated in stimulated neutrophils. As the only component of mtDAMPs that promotes calcium mobilization in neutrophils (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), signals derived from N-formyl peptides are likely to have driven the mtDAMP-induced phosphorylation of AMPK. Supporting this idea, we observed significantly reduced mtDAMP-induced AMPK phosphorylation in neutrophils pre-treated with CsH, an FPR-1 antagonist that prevents calcium mobilization upon mtDAMP stimulation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Demonstrating that AMPK is a negative regulator of NET formation, significantly enhanced and impaired NET formation has been reported for PMA stimulated neutrophils pre-treated with AMPK inhibitors and activators respectively (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Supporting these data, we showed significantly greater PMA-induced NET production by neutrophils treated with the AMPK inhibitor compound C prior to mtDAMP exposure. How activation of AMPK inhibits NET formation is currently unknown. Based on published literature, we propose two mechanisms, both of which revolve around the ability of AMPK to inhibit the serine/threonine protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Firstly, inhibition of mTOR has been shown to significantly reduce Glut1 transporter activity (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Given the importance of extracellular-derived glucose in NET formation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), reduced glucose uptake, secondary to impaired mTOR and Glut1 activity, could contribute to the reduction in NET production and lactate generation that we observed for neutrophils pre-treated with mtDAMPs. Furthermore, this mechanism could contribute to the mtDAMP-induced impairment we reported in neutrophil transmigration since chemotaxis also utilizes extracellular sources of glucose (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Alongside Glut1, mTOR signaling has been implicated in regulating the expression/activity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). A transcription factor involved in promoting aerobic glycolysis, activation of HIF-1&#x003b1; precedes both NET formation (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and myeloid cell migration (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Thus, reduced activity/expression of HIF-1&#x003b1;, secondary to AMPK-mediated inhibition of mTOR, could be an additional/alternative explanation for the mtDAMP-induced reduction in lactate generation, NET generation and neutrophil chemotaxis. Importantly, both these proposed mechanisms could occur in neutrophils without affecting their capacity for ROS production, which we found was significantly increased following mtDAMP treatment. Indeed, as the energy required for ROS generation is derived from endogenous sources of glucose (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), this anti-microbial function could occur in the background of an AMPK driven reduction in extracellular glucose uptake. Our finding of increased ROS production to PMA stimulation for neutrophils pre-treated with mtDAMPs contradicts the post-injury impairment we reported in ROS generation for trauma patients that presented with significantly elevated serum concentrations of mtDAMPs. We believe this discrepancy may be attributable to trauma-induced changes in the composition of the circulating neutrophil pool. For example, traumatic injury results in the emergence into circulation of IGs and CD16<sup>BRIGHT</sup> CD62L<sup>DIM</sup> neutrophils, both of which exhibit impaired stimulus-induced ROS generation (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In contrast, healthy subjects, who served as the cohort for our mtDAMP pre-treatment experiments, possess a homogenous pool of fully-functional mature neutrophils that would exhibit a greater capacity to respond to stimulation.</p><p>Although we have shown that neutrophils pre-treated with compound C exhibit increased NET generation upon PMA stimulation, inhibition of AMPK only partially ameliorated the reduction in NET formation that occurred with mtDAMP treatment. Other factors aside from AMPK activation must therefore be involved in mediating the mtDAMP-induced suppression of NET production. Recently, through a proposed mechanism of action that involved the prevention of membrane rupture, lactoferrin, an iron-binding glycoprotein stored within the secondary granules of neutrophils, was found to suppress NET release triggered by PMA stimulation (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Indicative of a defect in the latter stages of NET production, we showed chromatin decondensation in the absence of DNA release was a feature of mtDAMP-treated neutrophils. Thus, based on this observation and the fact that exposure to mtDAMPs promotes neutrophil degranulation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), we suggest that a mtDAMP-induced release of lactoferrin could represent an additional mechanistic explanation for the impairment in NET formation that occurs following mtDAMP exposure.</p><p>This study has some limitations. Conducted at a single major trauma center, the results of our prospective observational study are based on the analysis of a small number of patient samples, meaning our findings require validation in larger independent cohorts. This point is particularly pertinent to our analysis of pre-hospital blood samples, where inter-individual variability in immune cell number and volume of blood collected at the scene of injury meant we were unable to perform all assays on each patient at this time point. As a heterogeneous collection of proteins, lipids and DNA, no study to date has quantified the exact concentration of mtDAMPs released into the circulation post-injury. Thus, our <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment of neutrophils with 40 or 100 &#x003bc;g/ml mtDAMPs may not be physiologically relevant. However, these doses match those used in previous <italic>in vitro</italic> based studies that have examined the effect of mtDAMP exposure on neutrophil anti-microbial function (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Similarly, our decision to use the phorbol ester PMA as an agonist may be considered a study limitation. However, as a potent stimulus, it allowed us to study maximal neutrophil responses. Moreover, as the agonist of choice for all previous trauma-based studies that had examined stimulus-induced NET production post-injury (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), our use of PMA enabled us to compare our observations to those in the published literature.</p><p>In summary, this is the first study to describe a quantitative post-trauma reduction in NET formation as an immediate on-scene phenomenon, which is accompanied by aberrant intracellular signaling and cell metabolism. In addition, we have shown that the post-injury reduction in NET generation can be recreated <italic>in vitro</italic> by treating neutrophils isolated from healthy subjects with mtDAMPs prior to PMA stimulation. Thus, our data support the suggestion that the release of mtDAMPs from damaged tissue is a contributory factor in the reduction in neutrophil function that occurs post-injury (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>JH designed the study, performed experimental work, analyzed data, and wrote the manuscript.
