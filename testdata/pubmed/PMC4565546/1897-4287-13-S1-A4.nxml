In this study we analyzed 12 polymorphic variants and 2 deletions in <italic>PGR, ABCB1, ABCG2, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, ATM, TP53</italic> and <italic>ATP7B</italic> genes. Ten genetic modifications were significantly associated with the risk of developing ovarian carcinoma in at least one of the groups under study. <italic>PGR</italic> gene polymorphisms&#x02019; impact on ovarian cancer risk was specific only for the group of the <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers, which proves the difference in the modulation of ovarian cancer risk between sporadic and hereditary malignancies, including the breast-ovarian cancer group (as a cancer-prone group). The analyses showed also the importance of <italic>ATP7B</italic> gene in ovarian carcinogenesis, both studied variants of which significantly modulated the ovarian cancer risk in three out of four groups. Cumulative risk analysis revealed 3 unfavorable variants that significantly increased the risk of developing ovarian cancer, and also two favorable genotypes which protected against ovarian cancer.</p><p>Survival analysis for carriers of favorable versus unfavorable genotypes emphasized the importance of regulation of the cell cycle and active transport of xenobiotics during paclitaxel/cisplatin chemotherapy. The unfavorable variants could facilitate carcinogenic process and once their carriers developed malignancy, their chances of survival were smaller. Our analyses also showed a strong gene-dosage effect with the decrease of progression-free survival for the carriers of two unfavorable genetic factors.</p></sec></body></article>
