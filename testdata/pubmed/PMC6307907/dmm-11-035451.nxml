Comorbid conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke and liver disease, cause a large economic health burden in the United States. Human genetic studies have largely demonstrated a polygenic etiology for these diseases with little insight into individual gene function. Rare familial monogenic obesity syndromes have been informative in elucidating underpinnings of obesity, demonstrating roles for genes such as <italic>SIM1</italic> and <italic>TUB</italic> in obesity (<xref rid="DMM035451C2" ref-type="bibr">Barsh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="DMM035451C23" ref-type="bibr">van der Klaauw and Farooqi, 2015</xref>). These monogenic disorders account for a minute fraction of human obesity, which emphasizes the importance of finding new contributory loci (<xref rid="DMM035451C8" ref-type="bibr">Hendricks et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="DMM035451C13" ref-type="bibr">Kleinert et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The essential molecular components required for maintenance of body weight can be revealed by random germline mutagenesis, particularly when combined with automated mapping (<xref rid="DMM035451C24" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, we carried out a forward genetic screen of mice with <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutations, assessing for deviation from normal body weight. Here, we describe mice bearing a mutation in <italic>Arnt2</italic> (R74C), which developed hyperphagic obesity as well as fatty liver and glucose intolerance. A member of the basic helix-loop-helix/PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH/PAS) transcription factor family, <italic>Arnt2</italic> encodes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2), which is expressed in the CNS and is necessary for production of secretory hormones in the hypothalamus (<xref rid="DMM035451C7" ref-type="bibr">Hankinson, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="DMM035451C10" ref-type="bibr">Hosoya et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="DMM035451C12" ref-type="bibr">Keith et al., 2001</xref>). In marked contrast to mice with null mutations of <italic>Arnt2</italic>, homozygous <italic>Arnt2</italic><sup>R74C</sup> mice are born at expected Mendelian frequencies and survive to adulthood. Our findings reveal an important role for ARNT2 and ARNT2-dependent genes in regulating feeding behavior and body fat mass, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms controlling these traits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Weight-based screening of ENU-induced mutant mice</title><p>To identify genes required for the maintenance of normal body weight, we screened C57BL/6J third-generation (G3) mice bred to carry homozygous and heterozygous mutations induced by ENU in their great-grandsires (G0 mice). G3 mice were genotyped (prior to phenotypic screening) for all mutations present in their pedigree, passed down from a single G1 grandsire that was subjected to exome sequencing. G3 mice were individually weighed after weaning, and their ages noted (<uri xlink:href="http://dmm.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/dmm.035451.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>). Because G3 mice from a given pedigree are born over a period of 2-3 months and phenotypically screened as a group, raw body weight data could not be used directly for linkage analysis. Instead, we determined the body weight change of an individual mouse relative to the average body weight of age- and sex-matched mice among a group of 10,807 C57BL/6J G3 mice; these mice were housed under the same conditions and carried ENU-induced mutations. Body weight change was used as a continuous variable for linkage analysis. A total of 64,424 G3 mice from 2356 pedigrees were screened for phenovariance in the body weight screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DMM035451F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A,B). These pedigrees were a repository of 98,684 mutations in 17,702 genes that were transmitted to homozygosity three or more times and examined for phenotypic effects. Among the 98,684 mutations, 5906 mutations in 3856 genes were putative null alleles (premature stop codons or critical splice junction errors), while 29,693 mutations in 7789 genes were predicted to be &#x02018;probably damaging&#x02019; by PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping v2) with a score of 0.95 or greater (<xref rid="DMM035451C1" ref-type="bibr">Adzhubei et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="DMM035451TB1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). In the body weight screen to date, we estimate that 26.5% of the genome has been modified with truly damaging mutations that have been tested in the homozygous state at least three times (<xref rid="DMM035451C25" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

Therefore, we sought to assess the transcriptional consequence of the <italic>Arnt2</italic><sup>R74C</sup> mutation in the context of the ARNT2-SIM1 complex. The ability of the complex to activate transcription was assessed using a luciferase reporter gene under the control of six repeats of a bHLH-PAS core binding element [6&#x000d7;CME (CNS midline elements)]. Co-transfection of wild-type ARNT2 with SIM1 in HEK293T cells led to induction of the CME reporter as compared to cells without ARNT2-SIM1 or those with a mutated reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DMM035451F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>A).

Using an isogenic C57BL6/J background, we were able to eliminate variability due to genetic background. Using this unbiased approach, we found a previously undescribed role for the transcription factor ARNT2 in limiting body weight. Our findings indicate that ARNT2 functions to restrict feeding behavior, but has little effect on energy metabolism as measured by respiratory exchange ratio (RER), energy expenditure (EE) and cage activity. As a consequence of hyperphagic obesity, <italic>Arnt2</italic> mutant mice develop diabetes, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.</p><p><italic>Arnt2</italic><sup>R74C</sup> homozygous mice show similarly increased food consumption to <italic>Sim1<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (10% and 15%, respectively) (<xref rid="DMM035451C20" ref-type="bibr">Tolson et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="DMM035451C21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), which display deficits in neuroendocrine hormones that regulate feeding, such as oxytocin (<xref rid="DMM035451C14" ref-type="bibr">Kublaoui et al., 2008</xref>). Together with evidence that the ARNT2-SIM1 heterodimer is critical for embryonic development of the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei (<xref rid="DMM035451C17" ref-type="bibr">Michaud et al., 2000</xref>), which control feeding behavior, our findings suggest that ARNT2 cooperates with SIM1 to regulate the function of hypothalamic circuits regulating feeding in adult animals. RNAseq analysis of SIM1-expressing neurons from ARNT2 mutant mice may be informative in identifying ARNT2-SIM1-dependent hormones that regulate feeding. ARNT2 has additional binding partners within the nervous system, including NPAS4 (<xref rid="DMM035451C4" ref-type="bibr">Bersten et al., 2014</xref>); therefore, <italic>Arnt2</italic><sup>R74C/R74C</sup> mice may also show CNS transcriptional perturbations distinct from those of SIM1-deficient mice.</p><p>Whereas <italic>Arnt2</italic>-knockout homozygotes die perinatally (<xref rid="DMM035451C10" ref-type="bibr">Hosoya et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>Arnt2</italic><sup>R74C/R74C</sup> mice are fully viable, suggesting a hypomorphic effect of this missense mutation. Based on a reporter assay for ARNT2-SIM1-dependent transcription <italic>in vitro</italic>, we speculate that ARNT2<sup>R74C</sup> supports approximately 50% of wild-type levels of transcription, notwithstanding any additional target-specific regulation. This hypomorphic effect appears to probably be due to decreased nuclear translocation, resulting in decreased ARNT2-SIM1 heterodimers in the nucleus. Whatever the level, it is apparently sufficient during embryonic development to permit survival past the perinatal stage, but insufficient in controlling feeding behavior in adults. We note that differences in strain background between the null allele (<xref rid="DMM035451C10" ref-type="bibr">Hosoya et al., 2001</xref>) and the missense allele described here may also contribute to differences in viability of the respective homozygotes.</p><p>Forward genetic analysis of ENU-mutagenized mice can, in principle, reveal all non-redundant genes necessary for maintenance of normal body weight. Based on the identification of putatively causative obesity mutations in 15 distinct genes from a survey of 26.5% of mouse genes damaged and tested in the homozygous state three times or more, we estimate that weight-promoting mutations in approximately 56 genes will be identified once 100% saturation is achieved. To date, only <italic>Mc4r</italic> corresponds to a locus found in body mass index genome-wide association studies, a fact which may reflect the relative rarity of viable damaging mutations of the mapped loci in the human population (<xref rid="DMM035451C15" ref-type="bibr">Locke et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, hyperphagia leading to excess caloric intake is a major mechanism of the mapped mutations in this study, such as mutations in <italic>Lep</italic>, <italic>Lepr</italic>, <italic>Alms1</italic>, <italic>Mc4r</italic>, <italic>Ksr2</italic> and <italic>Arnt2</italic>.

Prior to phenotypic screening, all G3 mice were genotyped across coding mutations according to their pedigree using Ion Torrent AmpliSeq custom primer panels. Phenotypic screening was performed with the experimenter blinded to genotype and involved weighing individual G3 mice post-weaning; each mouse was weighed one time. To permit comparisons between mice of different ages and genders, body weight change was used instead of raw body weight data. Body weight change was calculated for each mouse relative to the average body weight for a given age and gender, determined from measurements of 10,807 G3 mice on a C57BL/6J background, carrying ENU-induced mutations, and housed under the same conditions (same vivarium, light cycle, feed and water).
