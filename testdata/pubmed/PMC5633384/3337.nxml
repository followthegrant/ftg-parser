Surprisingly, many TRGs play central roles in chromosome segregation; a core eukaryotic process. We thus find that genes that appear to be highly evolutionarily restricted do not necessarily play roles in species-specific biological functions but frequently play essential roles in core eukaryotic processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="61"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>The genomes of several hundred diverse eukaryotes have been sequenced. Comparing these genomes reveals sets of highly conserved, ancient genes that have clear orthologs present across the phylogenetic tree; these genes are typically well characterized and encode components of core eukaryotic machineries. For example, almost all eukaryotes have highly conserved orthologs of genes encoding components of the ribosome, proteasome, and nuclear pore. We use the term &#x0201c;shared gene&#x0201d; to refer to these genes which are shared across the phylogenetic tree. At the other end of the spectrum are a much more enigmatic and poorly studied set of genes, the large numbers of genes that have no detectable homology outside a very small set of highly related species. Such genes are found in the genome of every new species examined (reviewed in <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tautz and Domazet-Lo&#x00161;o 2011</xref> and <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) and frequently make up a large proportion of encoded genes; for example, &#x0223c;10&#x02013;20% of protein-coding genes in any typical eukaryotic genome have no detectable homology outside closely related species (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Khalturin <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Furthermore, as more genomes are sequenced, the number of these poorly conserved genes is ever increasing (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wilson <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) and they can be identified even when closely related species are compared. For example, human-specific genes have been identified that are not present in chimpanzees (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Knowles and McLysaght 2009</xref>). These genes were initially termed &#x0201c;orphan genes&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dujon 1996</xref>) and are more formally referred to as taxonomically restricted genes (TRGs); we use this terminology throughout.</p><p>Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of TRGs, and these fall into two broad categories. The first way is new gene birth. Here, new TRG open reading frames can arise directly from previously noncoding DNA: these <italic>de novo</italic> TRGs are entirely novel at their moment of birth. This process of new gene birth occurs frequently and gives rise to many new functional genes (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Carvunis <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). The alternative route for TRG creation is that they can arise from existing genes by mechanisms such as gene duplication, retrotransposition or recombination resulting in chimeric genes, or by the extreme divergence of an ancestral gene. In these cases, the TRGs may carry some or all of the functions of the ancestral genes from which they derive. Whether TRGs arise from previous noncoding DNA or through massive changes to ancestral coding sequences, TRGs encode proteins that sample novel areas of protein sequence space and thus could encode novel functions. However, despite extensive work examining the birth and origin of TRGs (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tautz and Domazet-Lo&#x00161;o 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>), we know very little about their functions. TRGs typically contain no characterized domains, have no detectable homology outside the genomes of highly related species, and are almost entirely neglected in traditional hypothesis-driven experiments. What do they do? In particular, do TRGs have functions specific to the particular biology of the species, or do TRGs play roles in conserved molecular processes? For example, do human-specific TRGs have human-specific functions or do human TRGs carry out conserved molecular functions in a human-specific way? While there are many examples of the biological roles for individual TRGs, ranging from novel biosynthetic pathways (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Weng <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), adaptation to cold environments (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 1997b</xref>), and honeybee eusociality (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and Tsutsui 2011</xref>), there have been no systematic studies to directly examine TRG functions in tractable model organisms. Our goal in this study is to use the systematic gene function data sets available in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and the nematode worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to investigate the functions of TRGs and how these evolved.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Defining TRGs</title><p>To define <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> TRGs, we employed a method similar to the &#x0201c;phylostratum&#x0201d; approach (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Domazet-Lo&#x00161;o and Tautz 2010</xref>). In brief, we defined <italic>C. elegans</italic> TRGs as genes with no evidence of homology outside Chromadorea; this includes <italic>Pristionchus pacificus</italic>, which diverged &#x0223c;300&#x02013;400 MYA (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dieterich <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). For <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we identified TRGs as genes with no homology outside Saccharomycetales, close to the most recent common ancestor of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> with <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, which leaves us with a comparable divergence time of 100&#x02013;300 MY of evolution (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and Berbee 2006</xref>). To assess homology, we took the proteome of either species [<italic>C. elegans</italic> (WS230) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> version 2011203] and used BLASTP to find genes with sequence similarity in the NCBI nonredundant protein database (February 7, 2013). Any BLASTP hit with an <italic>E</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.000001 over &#x0003e;30% of the protein length was considered evidence of homology, though we note that we tested other cutoffs and found that the analyses of this article were qualitatively similar (data not shown). In addition, we excluded any putative TRGs that encoded a known domain, as identified in the InterPro database (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> TRGs thus only have homology to genes in Chromadorea, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> TRGs only have homology to genes in Saccharomycetales, and no TRGs contain any conserved domains.</p><p>The phylostratum approach splits genes into groups depending on where on the tree of life they appear to have emerged, while instead we take a much coarser approach of a single group of TRG proteins. Since our article focuses on comparing essential and nonessential TRGs, and since there are very few essential TRGs, we cannot use a finer gradation on TRG age as it would eliminate our statistical power.</p><p>We defined an essential gene in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as those genes with either nonviable or growth-defective phenotypes in genome-wide RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) screens (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kamath <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), since these are the most robust phenotypes. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> we used the set of essential genes identified by the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Deletion Project (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Giaever <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>The expression of genes in the region surrounding TRGs</title><p>We examined the expression of genes using RNA-Seq data from young adult-staged <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ramani <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) in the genes which flanked genes of interest. To examine chromatin state, we obtained ChIP-chip data from modEncode (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) and calculated the median signal up to 5 kb upstream and 5 kb downstream of each gene of interest. In our analysis, we examined H3K27 methylation as a representative repression mark and H3K79 methylation as a representative activation mark. In all cases we tested for significance between different groups of genes using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>The expression correlation between TRGs and different molecular pathways</title><p>We measured expression correlation using a curated and normalized set of microarray data sets from the WormSPELL database. We calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient for a given microarray between the expression of a TRG and the expression of every other gene represented on the array. To improve the comparability of correlation coefficients between data sets, we used Fisher&#x02019;s Z-transformation (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hibbs <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>), and then averaged the correlations across arrays. For each TRG we further combined the correlation values to genes within a given KEGG pathway and averaged them to create a single number representing the correlation of this TRG to that group of genes. This yielded a single value which represents the average correlation of a given TRG to genes in a pathway of interest, averaged across a large data set of microarrays.</p><p>We used these correlation values in a logistic regression classifier, regularized with an elastic net (&#x003b1; = 0.5). We measured the strength of our classifier using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in cross-validation. To assess which features were most important for classification accuracy, we tested each feature individually in the logistic regression model using this same area under the ROC curve metric.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>The number of protein&#x02013;protein interactions made by TRGs</title><p>Worm protein&#x02013;protein interaction (PPI) data were downloaded from Worm-Interactome 8 (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Simonis <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>), yeast PPI data were from the BioGRID database (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stark <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), and we only examined genes with at least one interaction.

Finally, we also excluded any putative TRGs that contain well-annotated protein domains (see <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). This led us to define 691 yeast TRGs and 6018 worm TRGs (listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300193/-/DC1/TableS1.xls">Table S1</ext-link>). We note that even when we greatly relax our criteria for detecting homology, we fail to find any matches outside the restricted lineages for the great majority of the TRGs (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300193/-/DC1/FigureS1.eps">Figure S1</ext-link>). For example, &#x0003e;75% of yeast TRGs examined have no matches outside yeast genomes, even using the excessively relaxed criteria of 5% length match with a BLAST score of 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Consistent with this, while BLAST scores of many shared genes fall off slowly with phylogenetic distance, they drop off precipitously for TRGs (examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and for all yeast TRGs studied in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300193/-/DC1/FigureS2.eps">Figure S2</ext-link>); there are no significant hits outside a narrow set of closely related species.

They are required for viability in almost all conditions, are under stronger negative selection than other genes, and they are more highly transcribed (<italic>14</italic>&#x02013;<italic>16</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300193/-/DC1/FigureS3.eps">Figure S3</ext-link>). Most essential genes in yeast and worm are orthologs (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kamath <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Tischler <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) encoding components of basic cellular machineries such as the ribosome and the proteasome (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Zotenko <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>), and we refer to these shared essential genes as &#x0201c;shared&#x0201d; essentials throughout. Intriguingly, however, a small proportion of the essential genes, 23 (3%) in yeast and 96 (2%) in worm, are either yeast-specific or worm-specific TRGs. These TRGs have functions as central to the organism as shared cellular processes such as protein translation&#x02014;what are these biological roles? In the rest of this article, we explore the differences between these essential TRGs and the other, nonessential TRGs that give us insight into how a TRG might be as essential for the viability of an organism as a shared gene. We examine in turn three aspects of gene function: where and when these genes are expressed, the physical interactions made by the novel encoded proteins, and their <italic>in vivo</italic> functions.</p><sec id="s12"><title>Essential TRGs have similar expression to shared essential genes</title><p>We then first examined whether there were any differences in gene expression between essential TRGs and nonessential TRGs using existing data sets. It is well known that genes whose expression is correlated tend to have similar functions (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hughes <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). We thus explored the similarity in expression profiles between TRGs and genes with well-established functions across a wide array of different expression data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Specifically, we divide genes into specific functional modules using annotations from KEGG (<italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). For each TRG, we calculated its average coexpression with each KEGG-annotated functional module and find that essential TRGs tend to have more similar expression profiles than nonessential TRGs to shared modules such as RNA polymerase and the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300193/-/DC1/FigureS4.eps">Figure S4</ext-link> for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>), suggesting that essential genes have similar expression regardless of level of conservation. Finally, we examined whether combining all of these measurements of expression correlation together can predict whether a TRG is likely to be essential. We used logistic regression regularized with an elastic net (<italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) and find that expression correlation between a TRG and different KEGG pathways is strongly predictive of TRG essentiality (this yields an area of 0.87 under the ROC curve, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300193/-/DC1/FigureS5.eps">Figure S5</ext-link>A). We note that not all KEGG modules make an equal contribution to these predictions, specifically those modules comprised of essential genes are playing a disproportionate role (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300193/-/DC1/FigureS5.eps">Figure S5</ext-link>B). This suggests that essential TRGs are expressed in similar ways to shared essentials across a wide variety of different conditions and developmental stages.</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>TRGs with essential functions are differently expressed compared to nonessential TRGs.

We find that the gene neighbors of essential TRGs tend to have higher expression levels than the gene neighbors of nonessential TRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and the chromatin in the genomic region surrounding essential TRGs tends to be more transcriptionally active than that surrounding nonessential TRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>); these trends are most marked in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This suggests that the transcriptional environment surrounding the genomic location of a TRG may play a key role in its expression and hence in its ability to carry out an essential function.</p><p>In summary, then, we find that essential TRGs have similar expression profiles to shared essential genes, whereas nonessential TRGs have different expression profiles. At least at the level of expression, essential genes look similar regardless of their level of conservation across species.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Taxonomically restricted proteins tend to interact with shared essential proteins</title><p>We next examined the physical interactions made by proteins encoded by TRGs; we term these taxonomically restricted proteins (TRPs) for brevity. TRPs are known to have a different spectrum of PPIs when compared to shared genes (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Capra <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>); here we compare the PPI characteristics of essential TRPs compared to nonessential TRPs. We note that some analyses were only possible in yeast protein interaction networks where the coverage is far greater than for worm proteins; the yeast protein interaction network we use comprises &#x0003e;55,000 interactions and includes &#x0003e;75% of all yeast proteins, whereas the largest <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein interaction network has only &#x0223c;4300 interactions covering only &#x0223c;15% of worm proteins (<italic>Materials and Methods</italic>).</p><p>Previous studies showed that proteins encoded by essential genes have more interactions than those encoded by other genes (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Jeong <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>) and we find that this is true irrespective of whether we are dealing with shared essentials or TRG essentials: not only do the essential proteins that are shared between yeast and worm have more interactions than other shared proteins, but essential TRPs also have more interactions than the nonessential TRPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Intriguingly, while both the shared essential proteins and TRPs have many interactions, they may achieve this in several different ways. First, while yeast and worm shared essential proteins tend to be highly structured, yeast- and worm-specific essential TRPs often contain large regions predicted to be disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300193/-/DC1/FigureS6.eps">Figure S6</ext-link>). Crucially, in worms, essential TRPs have significantly more unstructured regions than nonessential TRPs, suggesting that this level of disorder is not specific to TRPs in general, but that these regions may contribute to their essential functions. It could be the case that this result is an artifact of excluding genes with well-annotated domains in the process of defining TRGs. However, repeating the analysis and including genes with well-annotated domains we find that it is still the case that yeast and worm essential TRPs have more disordered unstructured regions than shared essentials (yeast <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>, worm <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and that worm essential TRPs have more unstructured regions than nonessential TRPs (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup>). Disordered regions are known to mediate many PPIs; some become highly ordered following protein&#x02013;protein binding, others remain unstructured and act as a more flexible protein&#x02013;protein interface than those between highly structured proteins. They may also act as a rapidly evolving source of PPI motifs (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Goldman <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Davey <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). In addition to this large increase in the degree of disorder in essential TRPs, we also find that both yeast and worm essential TRPs have more coiled-coil domains than nonessential TRPs (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 in all cases, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test).

To ensure our results are robust to such choices, we have repeated our analyses defining TRGs at the more restricted level of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> rather than at the level of Chromadorea.

Furthermore, the expression is higher in genes surrounding essential TRGs (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, data not shown, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), and essential TRGs are still enriched in regions of active chromatin (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, data not shown <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>).

These TRGs are largely unstudied and are poorly functionally characterized. In this study, we examined the functions of TRGs in two eukaryotes, the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and the nematode worm <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We find that in both species, essential TRGs have many similar molecular properties to those of highly conserved essential genes: they are expressed similarly, and their encoded proteins have a high number of PPIs. However, unlike shared essential genes, they encode proteins with a greater degree of disorder, suggesting that they make these interactions in different ways. Interestingly, we find that many TRGs play essential roles in chromosome segregation, a core cellular process, and suggest that this is driven both by selection for divergence of existing components and through the recruitment of novel components to the chromosome-segregation machinery. We thus propose that while TRGs can underlie the evolution of lineage-specific behaviors and structures, they may also play lineage-specific central roles in shared processes such as chromosome segregation. TRGs can thus drive both the things you can do, and the way that you do them.</p><p>Our finding that many of the essential lineage-specific TRGs in yeast and worm play key roles in the chromosome-segregation machinery is intriguing. Chromosome segregation is one of the most basic cellular functions; all cells must be able to carry this out correctly and efficiently. Why should so many TRGs play key roles in this core process?</p><p>At its core, the chromosome-segregation machinery must nucleate microtubules from a microtubule-organizing center to form a spindle; spindles are then attached to chromosomes at centromeric sites via the kinetochore which acts as the adaptor between the spindle and the DNA. Surprisingly, centromeres, kinetochores, and microtubule-organizing centers are highly variable and different animal species have different solutions to the problem of chromosome segregation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Azimzadeh 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Duro and Marston 2015</xref>).

Some species, like <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, have a short (&#x0223c;125 bp) point centromere; others like humans and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> have a regional centromere comprising several hundred kilobases; and finally, some species like <italic>C. elegans</italic> are holocentric, with spindle-attachment points along the entire length of the chromosome. Centromeric DNA is usually assembled into nucleosomes that contain the CENP-A histone H3 variant and, unlike other histones, this is rapidly evolving under positive selection in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Talbert <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Malik and Henikoff 2001</xref>), and primates (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Schueler <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). There are also other genes which are also rapidly evolving roles at the centromere such as the <italic>Umbrea</italic> gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Ross <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Kinetochores assemble at centromeric regions and these multiprotein complexes also differ greatly between species, containing many TRGs. For example, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> kinetochores require the fungal-specific <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000004778/overview">Cbf3</ext-link> and DASH complexes (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Meraldi <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>); while, in humans, kinetochores require the vertebrate-specific SKA complex (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Welburn <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>); and the CCAN complex that is essential in humans is absent from fly and nematode genomes (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Westhorpe and Straight 2013</xref>). Finally, the microtubule-organizing center also varies greatly between animal cells: while animals use centriole-containing centrosomes, yeasts use a completely different structure, the spindle pole body; there is no homology between most of the components of these structures.</p><fig id="fig5" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Essential TRGs often have a role in chromosome separation. (A) A schematic showing differences in chromosome-segregation machinery in different opisthokonts. Spindles are shown in gray, microtubule-organizing centers are shown in shades of red, kinetochores in shades of green, and centromeric regions in shades of blue. Key kinetochore complexes acting in chromosome segregation are listed for each species. (B) Rate of evolution of different functional classes of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genes. The box plot shows the distribution of dN/dS values for yeast genes in each of 19 functional classes. Classes with significantly lower dN/dS are marked with green &#x02606;; classes with higher dN/dS are marked with red &#x02606;. The percentage of genes in each class that are TRGs is shown by the red line graph; functional classes with significantly higher numbers of TRGs are highlighted in red text. Pie charts show the proportion of TRGs that have essential functions in all classes that have at least 20 TRGs. Functional classes are from <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Costanzo <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref>, and dN/dS data are from <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Scannell <italic>et al.</italic> (2011)</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="3337f5"/></fig><p>The centromeres, kinetochores, and microtubule-organizing centers all differ greatly between metazoan species&#x02014;is this rapid evolution typical in all cellular machineries? We examined rates of evolution of a broad set of functional classes of yeast genes and find that genes that function in chromosome segregation are of the most rapidly evolving classes of gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also find that the functional classes that show the most rapid divergence of shared genes are also the functional classes that include the highest proportion of TRGs. For example, the amino acid biosynthesis pathway has the lowest rate of divergence (median dN/dS = 0.057; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, <italic>t</italic>-test) and also one of the lowest proportions of TRGs (3.5%; 7/200); the chromosome-segregation machinery, on the other hand, has one of the highest rates of divergence (median dN/dS = 0.113; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005, <italic>t</italic>-test) and the highest proportions of TRGs (15.6%; 36/231). We note that the picture that emerges from yeast and nematodes of the chromosome-segregation machinery as evolving rapidly and containing many TRGs appears to hold across the eukaryotic tree. For example, the kinetochores of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, a member of class Kinetoplastida, are comprised almost entirely of TRGs (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Akiyoshi and Gull 2014</xref>). The chromosome-segregation machinery thus appears to be particularly enriched for TRGs, its components are diverging rapidly, and the mechanisms of chromosome segregation are hugely diverse across eukaryotes (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Drechsler and McAinsh 2012</xref>).</p><p>Why might it be that we find so many essential TRGs in the chromosome-segregation machinery of different lineages? TRGs arise either by the <italic>de novo</italic> evolution of genes, or through the lineage-specific divergence of ancestral ortholog genes to the point of unrecognizable homology. It has previously been observed that some chromosome-segregation machinery components diverge rapidly at the sequence level through positive selection; in this model, centromeres are selfish drivers and are thus subject to &#x0201c;arms races&#x0201d; much like host parasite conflicts (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Henikoff and Malik 2002</xref>). We think this is unlikely to be the explanation for the high number of essential TRGs that we observe to participate in the chromosome-segregation machinery in yeast and nematodes. There is no evidence of positive selection in the TRGs we examined: the dN/dS is substantially less than one in all cases, indicating that all these genes are under purifying selection. Moreover, the mechanics of chromosome-segregation machinery in nematodes and yeast do not support a selfish driver model; in nematodes, chromosomes are holocentric, whereas in yeast meiosis yields four viable haploid spores. In neither case can meiotic drive result in selection for chromosome segregation-machinery divergence.</p><p>We suggest that the large numbers of apparently lineage-specific genes in the chromosome-segregation machinery are because a very wide range of sequences must be able to carry out similar essential functions in chromosome segregation. TRGs in the chromosome-segregation machinery are either under weak selection, allowing them to drift rapidly until homology is unrecognizable, even over relatively short evolutionary distances; or some of the functions of chromosome segregation-machinery components may simply be very easy to evolve and thus TRGs that arise <italic>de novo</italic> can readily evolve roles in this process. For example, eukaryotic microtubule-organizing centers are very diverse and range from evolutionarily unrelated protein complexes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, the spindle pole body in yeast and centrosomes in animals), to membranes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, the nuclear envelope in plants), to condensed DNA structures in kinetoplastids. This diversity shows that many different structures can act as effective microtubule-organizing centers and that this is a readily evolvable function. Similarly, many kinetochore components consist largely of coiled-coil regions; these evolve <italic>de novo</italic> very readily (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Rackham <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>) and novel coiled-coil domains could acquire roles in this complex. We note that convergent evolution occurs frequently in proteins that have no enzymatic activity but act as multimerized complexes, such as antifreeze proteins (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 1997a</xref>) and the crystallins that make up eye lenses (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Vopalensky and Kozmik 2009</xref>). The microtubule-organizing centers and kinetochore might be similar: they are organized in large multimeric complexes, and much of their molecular function rests on protein interactions mediated by simple motifs like coiled coil and disordered regions. We therefore suggest that the great enrichment of essential TRGs in the chromosome-segregation machinery is driven by two factors: first, by very relaxed constraints on the sequences that can function in the chromosome-segregation machinery; and, second, by the ease with which novel components can evolve functions in the chromosome-segregation machinery through the <italic>de novo</italic> evolution of low complexity protein sequences such as coiled coils and disordered regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s16"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Supplemental material is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300193/-/DC1">www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300193/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><media xlink:href="3337FigureS1.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM2"><media xlink:href="3337FigureS2.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM3"><media xlink:href="3337FigureS3.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM4"><media xlink:href="3337FigureS4.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM5"><media xlink:href="3337FigureS5.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM6"><media xlink:href="3337FigureS6.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM7"><media xlink:href="3337FigureS7.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM8"><media xlink:href="3337TableS1.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM9"><media xlink:href="3337TableS2.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM10"><media xlink:href="3337FileS1.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Ben Lehner, Jovana Drinjakovic, Fritz Roth, and Peter Roy for fruitful discussions of this work.
