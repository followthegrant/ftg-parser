One of the most popular methods for non-invasive monitoring of animal endocrine status is the glucocorticoid (GC) metabolite measurements, which can provide important information about how animals are affected by their surrounding environment. Here, we carried out the biological validation of corticosterone enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), which together with a cortisol EIA was used to quantified the concentrations of urofaecal GC metabolites (uGCMs) in wild and captive Blue-fronted amazon parrots (<italic>Amazona aestiva</italic>). Urofaecal GC concentrations were significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in free-living parrots (157.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;18.5&#x000a0;ng cortisol/g and 61.14&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;23.5&#x000a0;ng corticosterone/g dry urofaecal sample) than in those kept in captivity, which showed the comparable levels of GC metabolites independently of the management system applied. The higher uGCM levels obtained in the wild population point to an adaptive response for survival and species propagation in a more challenging environment, in comparison with captive animals. Furthermore, the lower uGCM concentrations in captive parrots may indicate an adaptive capacity of the species <italic>A. aestiva</italic> to captivity and its potential as a legal pet. The corticosterone EIA applied in this study proved to be an effective technique for the adrenocortical activity monitoring in this species. We discuss our findings considering the management and destiny given to wild-caught birds that are kept in confinement or returned to nature.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Psittacidae</kwd><kwd>cortisol</kwd><kwd>captivity</kwd><kwd>corticosterone</kwd><kwd>urofaecal glucocorticoid metabolites</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001807</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2010/20412-3</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100003593</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Psittacidae family represents one of the most challenging avian groups to be studied currently, since one-third of all known parrot species are considered at risk (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Berkunsky <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Brazil is home to the largest number (87) of Psittacidae species in the world (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Forshaw, 1989</xref>), although approximately half of these species are under a category of threat in the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">IUCN, 2018</xref>). Among Brazilian parrots, the Blue-fronted amazon (<italic>Amazona aestiva</italic>), also known as Blue-fronted parrot, Turquoise-fronted amazon or Turquoise-fronted parrot, is of particular interest for being one of the most popular parrot species kept in captivity (<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Seixas and Mour&#x000e3;o, 2002</xref>). It has a wide range of distribution, from northeast Brazil to Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina, and a large variety of habitats, mainly forested and Cerrado areas (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Juniper and Parr, 1998</xref>), although they can also be found practically throughout the country flying in flocks or couples.</p><p>Despite its current classification as Least Concern by the IUCN, this is one of the most common illegal traded parrots in Brazil and other Latin American countries (<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Pires, 2012</xref>). It is widely prized as a pet because of its sociability, intelligence, striking plumage and ability to copy different sounds and imitate the human voice (<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Tella and Hiraldo, 2014</xref>). Accurate data on the annual number of parrots taken from their natural habitat to supply the illegal pet trade are unknown, but the extensive trade pressure has justified its inclusion in the &#x02018;National Action Plan for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots of the Atlantic Forest&#x02019; in Brazil (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Lopes <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Chick poaching from nests for the pet trade and habitat destruction by direct human activities are causing an alarming decline in this and other Amazona species populations (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Juniper and Parr, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">Wright <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Berkunsky <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In Argentina, where the practice of removing wild animals from nature in quotas was legal, the number of Blue-fronted parrots authorized for export as part of the pet trade by Argentinian provinces between 1983 and 1991 was over 360 000 individuals (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Beissinger and Bucher, 1992</xref>), revealing the strong presence of this species as a pet. In Brazil, besides private households, the Blue-fronted amazon is also very frequently found in zoos and in rescue government centres such as Centres of Rehabilitation of Wild Animals or Wild Animals Selection Centres. In addition, these birds are among the most common species kept in captivity in this country (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Kuhnen <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), although their adaptation to the artificial habitats does not always happen. Unlike dogs and cats, which have been under human selection for thousands of years to become permanent pet companions, parrots are only in the very early stages of domestication and are genetically comparable to their wild ancestors, presenting, therefore, similar needs in captivity (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Meehan <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">Williams <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In this sense, when basic requirements are not provided, captive psittacines have a high predisposition to develop behavioural disorders associated with chronic stress (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In birds, like in mammals, the secretion of adrenal-derived glucocorticoid (GC) hormones is an important mechanism for dealing with stressors so that they are widely used as biomarkers to examine welfare and the adrenocortical status in a variety of taxa (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Millspaugh and Washburn, 2004</xref>). Whereas cortisol is the major endogenous GC released in fish and most mammals, corticosterone is primarily secreted in birds, reptiles, amphibians and some rodents (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Romero, 2004</xref>). These stress hormones are physiologically secreted at relatively low levels in undisturbed animals (baseline thereafter), fluctuating with circadian and seasonal rhythms in accordance with predictable metabolic demands to maintain the animal homeostasis (<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Reeder and Kramer, 2005</xref>). Although an acutely short-term secretion in response to unexpected perturbations in the environment, such as storms or predation, allows animals to cope with emergency situations, elevated GC levels over a prolonged period (chronic stress) may negatively influence their fitness, even leading to failure in reproductive function (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Landys <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">Thierry <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, it is currently difficult to differentiate whether elevated GC levels are secreted in response to unhealthy chronic stress or a healthy coping response. Knowing the baseline GC levels is, in many cases, the only way to answer important questions about stress physiology in wild birds, but this approach presents some limitations. For example, obtaining adequate and repeated blood samples in wild and/or small animals, such as many bird species, is particularly challenging, and the procedure itself may rise doubts about the interpretation of the adrenocortical responses because GC levels can increase in response to the handling stress (<xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">Touma and Palme, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Palme, 2019</xref>). In fact, researchers have considered that only samples collected in less than 3&#x000a0;min after capture will allow for accurate measurements of the baseline GC concentrations (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Romero and Reed, 2005</xref>). To tackle all these drawbacks, non-invasive methods have been extensively developed in the last decades, being the measurement of faecal GC metabolites one of the most used procedures for stress assessment in domestic and wild vertebrates (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Millspaugh and Washburn, 2004</xref>). In parrots, different studies have also applied such methods to non-invasively monitor increased adrenocortical activity in different species (e.g. <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Owen and Lane, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Costa <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). And, although only some of them use fully validated methods, this approach seems to offer a very attractive sampling alternative for this group of birds (<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">Young and Hallford, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">de Almeida <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Understanding how the physiology of parrot changes with their environment becomes crucial for their conservation. Therefore, we aimed at investigating the influence of different management systems on the urofaecal glucocorticoid metabolites (uGCM) excretion of free-living and captive individuals of <italic>A. aestiva</italic>. Our work will also promote a discussion about the need to return captive animals to nature and encourage more studies directed to the welfare of species in captivity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec3"><title>Animal study and sample collection</title><p>This study was approved by the Animal Ethics and Welfare Committee (Comit&#x000ea; de &#x000c9;tica e Bem-estar Animal) of the School of Agricultural and Veterinarian Sciences (Faculdade de Ci&#x000ea;ncias Agr&#x000e1;rias e Veterin&#x000e1;rias, FCAV) UNESP, Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil (protocol number 009350/11).</p><p>In avian species, faeces and urine are mixed in the cloaca and both portions are usually excreted together in form of droppings (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000f6;stl <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Although in some occasions it is possible to separate these two fractions, using them together as a single sample has been recommended to achieve a more integrated estimate of the total hormones (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Millspaugh and Washburn, 2004</xref>). Therefore, we collected complete droppings (also referred as urofaecal samples) of 86 Blue-fronted parrots of different origins (wild, commercial breeder, zoo and pets) in Brazil between July and August 2011 (see <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

The animals were physically immobilized and held in the hands for 30&#x000a0;min to provoke a stressful stimulus. The urofaecal collection started just after the end of the restraint period (time 0), and it continued at 2-h intervals for a period of 38&#x000a0;h. Droppings from both individuals were available at all collection intervals, except at 24&#x000a0;h in the case of the female, and presented no abnormal characteristics during all the experiment. The samples were treated in the same way as those from the other groups. Some urofaecal samples were also collected prior to the validation procedure to establish natural concentrations of GCM. The corticosterone enzyme immunoassay (EIA) successfully detected the expected increase in corticosterone metabolites (CMs) following the physical restraint (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Such a procedure caused a very comparable adrenocortical response in both sexes achieving values of 40&#x000a0;ng/g in the male after 6&#x000a0;h and 41&#x000a0;ng/g in the females after 4&#x000a0;h. A second CM rise can be observed after 24 and 30&#x000a0;h in the male and female, respectively.</p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Urofaecal CM concentrations (ng/g dry matter) profile from a physical restraint procedure (h 0) in (<bold>A</bold>) a female and (<bold>B</bold>) a male Blue-fronted parrot (<italic>A. aestiva</italic>) using a corticosterone EIA.

Polyclonal cortisol antiserum (R4866) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) ligands were supplied by Dra.

The antiserum presented the following cross-reactivities (provided by the laboratory): 100% cortisol, 58.3% prednisolone, 10.9% prednisone, 7.0% cortisone, 5.7% 11-deoxycortisol, 1.9% 21-deoxycortisol, 0.9% 17a-hydroxyprogesterone, 0.9% dexamethasone, 0.4% triamcinolone and &#x0003c;0.004% corticosterone, progesterone and DHEA. Urofaecal corticosterone levels were determined using the same EIA for cortisol with some modifications: 33.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of corticosterone CJM06 antibody (also supplied by Dra. C. Munro) were initially pipetted onto micro plates for incubation, and the polyclonal anticorticosterone antiserum and the HRP conjugated corticosterone label were diluted to 1:15 000.

The sensitivity of the assays was calculated as the value 2 SD from the mean response of the zero (Bo) tube, being 0.60&#x000a0;ng/g (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) and 1.96&#x000a0;ng/g (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) for cortisol EIA and corticosterone EIA, respectively. Inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) for low (~30%) and high (~70%) value quality controls were 3.1 and 7.4% for the corticosterone EIA and 11.8 and 15.7% for the cortisol EIA, respectively. All samples were re-analysed if the duplicate CV was &#x0003e;10%; therefore, intra-assay CV were &#x0003c;10% for both EIA.

Free-living parrots presented significantly higher uGCM concentrations in comparison with those kept in captivity. In addition, all captive groups showed comparable levels of urofaecal cortisol metabolites independently of the management system applied, whereas CM levels were slightly but significantly higher for the parrots from the commercial breeder, compared with the animals kept in the zoo or living as pets.

Results of the physical restraint showed that the corticosterone EIA can be used for quantifying CM in urofaecal samples of Blue-fronted amazon and, consequently, for monitoring adrenocortical response in captive and free-ranging individuals. Moreover, different studies have already demonstrated the possibility of using other validated EIA to evaluate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in this species (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Fujihara <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, the restraint was stressful enough to provoke urofaecal CM peaks. The first peaks appeared only a few hours after the procedure in both sexes, between 4 and 6&#x000a0;h, in agreement with the reported gut-passage delay times (2.1&#x02013;5.5&#x000a0;h) in Amazon parrots (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">McMillan, 1994</xref>). In this same species, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (2015</xref>) obtained similar results using a cortisone assay reporting peaks 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;h after stimulation by Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge in both sexes, whereas <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Fujihara <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (2014</xref>), using a cortisol assay, obtained more diverse results with peaks between 2 and 4&#x000a0;h after the ACTH administration for males and 10&#x000a0;h after in females. Furthermore, these results are comparable with those reported by <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">de Almeida <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> (2018</xref>) in blue-and-yellow macaws (<italic>Ara ararauna</italic>) or by <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Sinhorini (2013</xref>) in golden parakeets (<italic>Guaruba guarouba</italic>), who reported a second peak 20&#x000a0;h and between 11 and 15&#x000a0;h after the Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge, respectively.</p><p>Although non-invasive methods have already been used to measure stress response in captive Blue-fronted parrots (e.g. <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Fujihara <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">Queiroz <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Matos <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), this is the first study to quantify GC concentrations in a wild population of this species. Significantly higher GC levels were obtained in free-living parrots, which may be associated with a more challenging and, consequently, a more energetically demanding living environments compared with those provided to captive parrots. Activities such as foraging, immune responses or thermoregulation entail a doubtless expenditure of energy that is reflected in a higher GC baseline (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Goymann <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Jimeno <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Wild parrots, which spend a significant part of the day in foraging activities, flying even kilometres to increase their chances of finding food (<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">van Zeeland <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), are therefore supposed to have higher GC levels than those with more limited activity.</p><p>This study was carried out at the onset of the reproductive period of this species, a very energetically demanding period that typically results in an elevation of the GC basal levels (<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Romero, 2002</xref>). This energy demand, however, seems to be lower in animals under captivity compared with their wild counterparts, probably because it is associated with their lower foraging requirements (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Speakman, 2005</xref>). These findings are in agreement with those reported by <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Gardiner and Hall (1997</xref>) who observed that reproductive free-living harbour seals (<italic>Phoca vitulina</italic>) presented higher cortisol levels than those kept in captivity, likely triggered by a stronger dispute for food and mates. Therefore, reproduction may be responsible, in part, for the higher stress hormone levels in free-ranging parrots. This is supported by the fact that CM concentrations in the commercial breeder parrots are increased when compared with other captive animals in the zoo or living as pets, which were not reproducing. However, such an increase in GC levels during reproduction can be considered normal and even necessary to increase the chances of reproductive success in birds (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Pereira <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). For example, in the breeding period, increased GC concentrations were essential for promoting the foraging activity to achieve a good body condition (<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">Stearns, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Descamps <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Hennin <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) and for enhancing the parental reproductive effort (<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Romero, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Love <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">Thierry <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Although no additional data on stress hormone levels are available for this species in their natural environment, we can infer that these differences in GC values among wild and captive parrots are attributed to non-stressful adaptive strategies that allow animals to deal with unpredictable environmental disturbances (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">McEwen and Wingfield, 2003</xref>). However, even with a potential beneficial effect, increases in GC baseline have been traditionally considered as pernicious, placing these physiological responses at the same level as those that occur in reactions to unexpected and life-threatening stimuli, in which energetic demand increases and corticoids are acutely released (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Scheuerlein <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The breeding success and the lack of abnormal behaviours and the population stability observed since 1997 (<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Seixas, 2009</xref>) in our free-living group seem to suggest that the higher uGCM concentrations obtained in this individuals are normal physiological levels for them.</p><p>Lack of food has been closely associated with higher GC secretion in wild birds (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Kitaysky <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Lendvai <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In the case of the free-living Blue-fronted amazon parrots, the urofaecal samples were collected in July, at the onset of the dry season, when food availability is at its highest for these animals in the Pantanal region (<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Seixas, 2009</xref>). But, in addition to natural resources, these animals received an extra supplementation of food provided by the Fazenda San Francisco staff to bring these parrots closer to tourists, thus helping to meet part of their daily energy demand. This situation of abundant food is another reason why we hold the opinion that the uGCM levels obtained from this group of parrots in the Pantanal region are normal. Therefore, the use of these values as a baseline for this species would allow evaluating the effect of different captive management systems on the GC secretion and, consequently, the appearance of stress.</p><p>In general, captive animals do not have to deal with the stress-inducing factors that normally exist in natural environments such as predation, lack of food, or adverse weather conditions. This more protective environment could help animals to keep low GC profiles such as those observed in all captive parrots used in this report independently of the husbandry system. These results are in agreement with those reported in Siberian tigers, where the exposure to severe environmental conditions resulted in a significantly higher HPA axis activity in free-living tigers compared with captive tigers, more sheltered by the zoo facilities (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Naidenko <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). However, captivity by itself is a limiting factor for animals, and in some occasions, they are unable to adapt with a consequent increase in their GC levels, as reported in a study comparing faecal cortisol metabolites levels between captive and wild cheetah (<italic>Acinonyx jubatus</italic>) (<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">Terio <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In such case, however, the poor genetic variability of this species is suggested as one of the reasons for chronic stress in these animals. Unlike cheetahs, the Blue-fronted amazon has a high genetic diversity (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Caparroz <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), allowing its populations to adapt better to challenging environments.</p><p>Acclimatisation appears to be an important aspect of stress in captivity. Unacclimated wild-caught sparrows also presented higher corticosterone values in comparison to their wild, free-living counterparts (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Marra <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). For Gray wolves (<italic>Canis lupus</italic>), corticosteroid-induced alkaline phosphatase activity, an isoenzyme commonly used to quantify stress in canids (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Ochi <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), was detected in some of the free-ranging wolves but not in long-term captive animals (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Constable <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In our study, all the captive parrots were under captivity for years before the faecal sample collection, having already been habituated to the confinement conditions and, consequently, showing a lower stress response. Although chronic stress has also been associated with low GC levels in birds (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Rich and Romero, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Cyr and Romero, 2007</xref>) and could account for our findings with captive parrots, this is unlikely to be the case, especially for the favourable reproductive outcomes obtained by the breeding animals, suggestive of absence of chronic stress (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000f6;stl and Palme, 2002</xref>). Moreover, it is well known that chronic stress plays a very important role in the development of behaviour disorders in captive parrots, such as the feather damaging behaviour (<xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">van Zeeland <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Costa <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). This abnormal behaviour is commonly used to measure welfare in both production and zoo animals (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Dixon, 2008</xref>), and it is also very frequently observed in Psittacidae species (see review <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">Van Zeeland <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), including <italic>Amazona</italic> spp. parrots (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Garner <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), maintained in suboptimal environment conditions (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Costa <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). We can thus infer that the low GC levels in these animals may not be attributed to chronic stress but to the good captive conditions provided to the animals in all husbandry systems studied. Although not statistically significant, parrots from private houses, which probably received more attention and loving care by the owners, showed the lowest levels of uGCM, supporting the idea of good living conditions provided to these animals. In this context, the parrots kept as pets frequently share a similar life story, being illegally captured in the wild as chicks and hand-rearing to encourage imprinting. In this way, the owners manage to maintain a close and loving relationship with their companion animals (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Low, 1985</xref>). Hundreds of parrot chicks are annually seized from the illegal wildlife trade in Brazil and sent to rehabilitation centres where they receive care until they are ready to fly and return to the wild, preferentially (<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Santos and Lopes, 2006</xref>). However, the indiscriminate release of hundreds of hand-reared animals can result in serious problems for natural populations such as diseases (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Raso <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Ecco <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Godoy and Matushima, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Saidenberg <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), behavioural disorders (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Chapple <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) or exogamic depression (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Banes <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). In fact, during our sample collection, we witnessed the release of a captive group of Blue-fronted parrots in the Fazenda S&#x000e3;o Francisco area, which showed behavioural disorders a few months later. The sudden change of habitat could have lead them to an allostatic overload of their regulatory systems, preventing the development of an adequate adrenocortical response by the HPA axis (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Matos <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) and causing a maladaptation of these animals in the wild (<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Santos and Lopes, 2006</xref>). This unsatisfactory stress response has been already further underlined by some studies that associated low GCM levels in domesticated or captive animals with poor welfare or disease (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Dorsey <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Pawluski <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Therefore, in a situation where captive Blue-fronted parrots show no signs of chronic stress, the real biological value of their release in nature is questionable. Once adapted to captivity, these individuals might be better suited to other purposes, such as environmental education in zoos, or as breeding animals in registered breeders to produce parrots destined to the pet legal market (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Alves <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the biological validation carried out in this study shows that this corticosterone EIA is capable of monitoring biologically relevant changes in uGCM in the captive and free-living Blue-fronted parrots<italic>.</italic> To our knowledge, this is the first study to measure stress hormone levels in a natural population of this species. The higher uGCM levels obtained in the wild population point to an adaptive response for their survival and the species propagation in a more challenging environment, in comparison to captive animals with lower concentrations. This study showed how appropriate captive conditions may contribute to reducing uGCM levels in parrots. However, low GC concentrations cannot be considered <italic>per se</italic> as a welfare indicator, but they must be complemented with the determination of other parameters such as breeding success and/or the absence of abnormal behaviours, frequently observed in this group of birds. The results obtained from captive parrots should help to spread a more adequate idea about captivity, showing that it is not a stressful habitat for wildlife despite being frequently labelled as such. A good understanding about the biology of the species, including the &#x02018;basal&#x02019; levels of the stress hormones in captive and free-living animals, could also help to prevent the development of chronic stress or to apply corrective measures to improve the welfare and conservation both <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>ex-situ</italic>. Overall, we hope to highlight the high capacity of the Blue-fronted amazon parrot to adapt to captivity conditions and its potential as a legalized pet, thus encouraging a higher presence of this species in private houses and in registered breeders. As the pet market grows, legal reproduction of Psittaciformes in captivity could become an important tool for the conservation of natural populations. However, professional breeding and further research to improve the reproductive outcomes of this species in captivity are extremely necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="coz097-ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to the authorities and staff from the Municipal Zoo of Piracicaba, the Fazenda S&#x000e3;o Francisco and the Brisa commercial breeder, as well as the owners of the parrots from private houses for all their provided support.
