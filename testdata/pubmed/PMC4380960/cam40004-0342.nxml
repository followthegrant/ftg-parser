DNA hypermethylation profiles differ significantly by HPV status suggesting that a specific subset of methylated CpG loci could give mechanistic insight into HPV-driven OPSCC. We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation of primary tumor samples and adjacent normal mucosa from 46 OPSCC patients undergoing treatment at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 beadchip. For each matched tissue set, we measured differentially methylated CpG loci using a change in methylation level (M value). From these analyses, we identified a 22 CpG loci panel for HPV+ OPSCC that included four <italic>CDKN2A</italic> loci downstream of the p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) transcription start sites. This panel was significantly associated with overall HPV detection (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05; ROC area under the curve&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.96, 95% CI: 0.91&#x02013;1.0) similar to the subset of four <italic>CDKN2A</italic>-specific CpG loci (0.90, 95% CI: 0.82&#x02013;0.99) with equivalence to the full 22 CpG panel. DNA hypermethylation correlated with a significant increase in alternative open reading frame (ARF) expression in HPV+ OPSCC primary tumors, but not to the other transcript variant encoded by the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> locus. Overall, this study provides evidence of epigenetic changes to the downstream region of the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> locus in HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer that are associated with changes in expression of the coded protein products.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Carcinoma</kwd><kwd>HPV</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>oropharynx</kwd><kwd>squamous</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is recognized as a distinct disease associated with improved survival and response to therapy, and carries distinct pathologic and molecular characteristics, including positive immunostaining for the p16 protein <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Results from molecular array studies also support the hypothesis that HPV-positive and negative OPSCC are biologically distinct and may represent different cancer lineages formed through separate etiologic pathways of multistage tumorigenesis <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Despite the recognized importance of HPV in OPSCC, the pathobiology of HPV in OPSCC tumors is not well understood.</p><p>HPV detected in OPSCC tumors (HPV16, the most common high-risk type also found in cervical cancer) is frequently integrated and transcriptionally active, with the majority of HPV+ tumors expressing the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 interact with and inactivate the cellular tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb, respectively, and are responsible for disrupting the p16(INK4A) tumor suppressor pathway <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. P16 protein expression is associated with improved survival among patients with OPSCC <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, and p16 immunostaining is used routinely in a clinical setting as a surrogate marker of HPV infection in OPSCC, but shows poor clinical utility in nonoropharyngeal head and neck cancers <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. The <italic>CDKN2A</italic> gene, which codes for both the p16 protein and its alternate reading frame (p14ARF) is frequently affected by epigenetic gene silencing and deletion in other head and neck cancers, and both have been established as known tumor suppressors in head and neck carcinogenesis <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. In spite of their structural and functional differences, both proteins share a common functionality in cell cycle control. This ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53 via its interaction and inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2. Its partner p16 is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK4 and CDK6.</p><p>As in other cancers, multiple genetic and epigenetic events have been implicated in head and neck carcinogenesis <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Our group has recently shown a significantly higher number of differentially methylated CpG loci in HPV+ OPSCC tumors compared to their HPV&#x02212; counterparts <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. We now identify a novel 22 CpG loci panel that is significantly associated with HPV detection and p16 expression in OPSCC patients from our population as well as in an independent cohort of OPSCC from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Included in this panel are four CpG loci located downstream of the p16(INK4A) transcription start site that are hypermethylated in HPV+ OPSCC primary tumors compared to normal tissues, and associated with increased expression of the p14(ARF) gene product. Our results establish a potential mechanism connecting HPV positivity and expression of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> transcripts that is separate from tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb, and may involve direct epigenetic regulation of ARF transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>All patients consented to participation in this study under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the participating institutions. All primary tumor and histologically normal adjacent tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30&#x000a0;min of surgical resection or biopsy and kept at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further processing. Adjacent mucosa was taken at a grossly unremarkable site away from the tumor identified by the surgeon (incisional biopsy) intraoperatively or by the pathologist (resection specimen) when processing the specimen for frozen section or final diagnosis as described previously <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. TNM staging was based on the AJCC classification. Control samples for all tumors were acquired; microscopic slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin were assessed for percentage of tumor, extent of necrosis, and degree of lymphocytic infiltration as described previously <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>HPV testing of patient samples</title><p>All patient samples were tested for HPV infection using multiple testing methods.

For example, the HPV16 oncoprotein E7 causes the release of E2F-1 from its repressor Rb <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, while the E2F-1 transcription factor promotes the transcription of important S phase entry proteins and ARF <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. There is also regulatory feedback loop between ARF and p53, where p53 functions as an p14(ARF) transcriptional repressor and ARF prevents p53 degradation <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. HPV16 oncoprotein E6 promotes the degradation of p53, thereby removing its inhibitory effects on p14(ARF) transcription <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>.</p><p>Overall, the results implicate hypermethylation of these downstream CpG sites in the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> gene as a potential mechanism for increased p16 expression in HPV+ OPSCC tumors. However, the mechanism by which the hypermethylated downstream CpG island region leads to altered expression of transcripts originating from the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> locus is not clear. Our assessment of the region reveals a large number of Sp1 binding sites, a pattern observed previously in downstream CpG island regions involved in transcription initiation, particularly those of some long noncoding RNAs <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. It has also been demonstrated that a specific Sp1 recognition sequence is critical for the transactivation of the <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;1</italic> promoter by HPV16 E6 and E7 in cervical cancer <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Taken together, the epigenetic mechanisms described above, combined with our description of a potential downstream regulatory region demonstrating DNA hypermethylation in OPSCC tumors, provide a plausible hypothesis that HPV may induce an increase in expression of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> transcripts (specifically p14(ARF)) in OPSCC.</p><p>A number of limitations should be considered when interpreting these results. While the 22 CpG loci panel best distinguished HPV infection in this cohort, we are cognizant of the fact that host genetic events such as mutations observed in p53 and p16 (possibly caused by tobacco carcinogens) may confound associations between HPV infection, panel DNA methylation, p16 expression, and clinical outcome. The specific genotyping of this population as it relates to those events will be the focus of future work by our group. While the agreement in associations seen with TCGA supports our findings, it should be noted that our study sample was small and represented a subset of cases from a larger cancer patient cohort; its probable additional methylation changes may better resolve ambiguous primary tumors for which there is discordance between HPV assays. It should also be pointed out that our study was focused specifically on host genome DNA methylation. DNA methylation of the HPV viral genome will be the focus of a future study. And finally, it is not clear whether viral proteins are directly involved in the methylation of the CpG loci downstream of the CDKN2A gene promoter, or whether this relies on other ancillary proteins.</p><p>In summary, we observed that HPV-positive OPSCC has significantly increased <italic>DNMT1</italic> expression compared to HPV&#x02212; cases. Further whole-genome DNA methylation analysis identified a subset of 22 CpG that were significantly associated with HPV detection in OPSCC in two independent cohorts. Within this panel, we identified a hypermethylated region downstream of the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> gene that was associated with p16 protein expression in OPSCC and is correlated with an increase in tumor-specific expression of the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> transcript variant p14(ARF).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Genomics Core for help with the bisulfite sequencing assays for cytosine methylation.
