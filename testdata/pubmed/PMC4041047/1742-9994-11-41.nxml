Oxidative stress is one of the best documented mechanisms underlying costs of reproduction to date. However, other, yet to be described molecular mechanisms that play a short term role during reproduction may explain the negative relationships underlying the cost of reproduction. To identify such new mechanisms, we used a global proteomic determination of liver protein profiles in laboratory adult female mice whose litter size had been either reduced or enlarged after birth. This litter size manipulation was expected to affect females by either raising or decreasing their current reproductive effort. At the same time, global parameters and levels of oxidative stress were also measured in all females.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Based on plasma analyses, females with enlarged litters exhibited increased levels of oxidative stress at the date of weaning compared to females with reduced litters, while no significant difference was found between both the latter groups and control females. None of the liver proteins related to oxidative balance were significantly affected by the experimental treatment. In contrast, the liver protein profiles of females with enlarged and reduced litters suggested that calcium metabolism and cell growth regulation were negatively affected by changes in the number of pup reared.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Plasma oxidative stress levels in reproductive mice revealed that the degree of investment in reproduction can actually incur a cost in terms of plasmatic oxidative stress, their initial investment in reproduction being close to maximum and remaining at a same level when the energy demand of lactation is reduced. Liver proteomic profiles in reproductive females show that hepatic oxidative stress is unlikely to be involved in the cost of reproduction. Reproductive females rather exhibited liver protein profiles similar to those previously described in laboratory ageing mice, thus suggesting that hepatic cell pro-ageing processes may be involved in the cost of reproduction. Overall, our data illustrate how a proteomic approach can unravel new mechanisms sustaining life-history trade-offs, and reproduction costs in particular.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Reproduction cost</kwd><kwd>Trade-off</kwd><kwd>Proteomics</kwd><kwd>Oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>Ageing</kwd><kwd>Mice</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Life history theory has been said to explain the incredibly wide range of biological designs that allow organisms to successfully reproduce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The main basis of this theory is that the limited resource availability entails an obligation to share it between different life history traits (the latter are often simplistically restricted to growth, reproduction and lifespan). Within this framework, the so-called cost of reproduction has attracted most of our attention in the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] because the individuals that reproduce the most are also the most likely to favour evolutionary changes through intergenerational genes transfer. For some time now, the cost of current reproduction has been described as an ultimate consequence, by either a reduction of future reproductive success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] or a decreased survival rate of reproductive adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The fact that humans do not escape this reproduction <italic>vs.</italic> lifespan trade-off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] underlines its widespread importance in evolution. However, when studies started to question the nature of the mechanisms sustaining reproductive cost, it rapidly became clear that the theory of a simple resource allocation trade-off (i.e. the competitive allocation of limited energy between body maintenance and longevity assurance on the one hand, and reproductive processes on the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]) was often unsatisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The non-energy based, proximate explanations of reproductive cost that then emerged largely improved the initial Y-shape trade-off models by highlighting the pleiotropic effects of hormones, the importance of cell signalling pathways and genetics, or the adverse impact of reproduction on body maintenance through oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, the extent to which oxidative stress affects reproductive cost remains under debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For example, the assumption that oxidative stress increases in the liver of reproductive female mice has recently been challenged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Because trade-offs may occur at functional levels ranging from cellular, tissue, physiological, and individual (physiology) to population/evolutionary (genetic), their detection remains a key challenge in evolutionary studies and is crucial to better explain why physiological and evolutionary trade-offs do not always match [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Proteins are main actors of physiological processes such as metabolism, development and homeostasis, so their screening via proteomics methodologies can be seen as a recent technical revolution for biological and medical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. By unravelling the expression of the proteome, both qualitatively (protein identification and characterization of post-translational modifications) and quantitatively (expression level of each protein), proteomics notably make it possible to establish a link between the genome and the phenotype of an organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The proteome not only reflects the genomic information inherited from the parents and shaped by evolutionary processes, but is also influenced by environmental and developmental conditions, incorporating for example non-genetic inheritance modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. As such, the proteome should directly reflect individual phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], the main level at which selection occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, the more recent progress in instrumentation and the increase in bioinformatic resources permit the analysis of proteins from almost any species, even non-sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and have thus increased attractiveness of proteomics in several evolutionary biology fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] such as population dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], speciation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], phylogenetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], or phenotypic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, none of the aforementioned studies used proteomics to explore the nature of the mechanisms sustaining evolutionary trade-offs. We therefore aimed to do so in reproducing female mice that had previously been subjected to an experimental litter size manipulation. Litter size manipulation has indeed been proved to be an efficient method to assess the cost of reproduction in small mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. From previous studies, the hepatic metabolic functions of reproducing mice are expected to be stimulated because of the need to process an increased quantity of absorbed nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This would imply an enhanced function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain thus generating ROS and causing possibly an increase in hepatic oxidative stress. However, recent data suggest that oxidative stress does not increase with enhanced reproductive effort during lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, we analyzed here the liver proteome of lactating mice not only to gather complementary data regarding the expression levels of antioxidant and metabolic liver proteins, but also and above all to uncover previously unknown changes that could represent/reflect new mechanisms (e.g. involving either metabolic or cell-related pathways) that could underlie the reproduction trade-off.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of litter size manipulation on mother and offspring</title><p>The impact of litter size manipulation on reproduction was evaluated on both offspring and mothers (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Adult female body mass did not differ among groups, either before litter size manipulation or at the end of the experiment. Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> also shows that there were no significant differences in litter size and litter mass among the three experimental groups before litter size manipulation (mean litter size across all groups: 7.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4 pups; mean litter mass, 9.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7&#x000a0;g, F<sub>2,11</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.36, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.97). Our experiment successfully created three groups of females weaning significantly different numbers of offspring (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Post hoc tests showed that females with enlarged litters (FEL) were weaning significantly larger litter sizes than females with reduced litters (FRL) (Bonferroni post hoc, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004). The size of litters for Control females was midway between the sizes of the two other groups, and was not significantly different from them (Bonferroni post hoc, Control <italic>vs.</italic> FRL: P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.122 and Control <italic>vs.</italic> FEL: P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.181). At the end of the experiment, offspring exhibited a body mass which was not significantly different in relation to experimental litter size (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), despite a trend towards heavier pups in Reduced litters.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>ANOVAs for Global parameters in litters and reproductive adult

Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> indicates the loading values of each protein. Given our relatively small sample size, only protein loadings over 0.6 were taken into account (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]), and our results were thus reduced to 6 protein spots and 8 proteins. Taking into account the main biological activity (based on biological process GO ontologies and literature examination; see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> for details) of the proteins that cluster on the same component, our results suggest that PC1 was related to calcium metabolism and ageing markers while PC2 represented cell growth and biogenesis regulation. Glucose metabolism-related proteins were also present in both components. PC1 and PC2 indices were further used in an ANOVA analysis to determine how the two components were affected by litter size manipulation (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).

However, other non-energy based mechanisms may underlie the cost of reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Our study lends credibility to this idea, as the proteomic patterns we obtained suggest that oxidative stress is not necessarily observed at the tissue level despite its presence at the plasma level. The sole determination of systemic oxidative stress may thus be insufficient, and may blur our perception of reproductive costs. In fact, the use of proteomics enabled us to highlight both non-energy and non-oxidative stress mechanisms as new pathways through which reproductive costs may be expressed.</p><sec><title>Cost of reproduction and oxidative stress</title><p>Oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (mainly attributable to mitochondria during energy processing) and antioxidant defences/repairing processes that have the ability to either buffer ROS or counterbalance their negative effects on bio-molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In mice, a plethora of studies have been conducted to experimentally test the oxidative mediation of reproductive cost (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and references therein). There is a debate about reproductive costs, and whether they are attributable to reproduction alone or rather to the effort required for raising more young [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. By directly testing the impact of the degree of investment in reproduction, our litter size manipulation underlined that rearing a higher number of pups than initially programmed triggers significantly higher levels of plasmatic oxidative stress than rearing a lower number of pups than initially programmed. Thus, the degree of investment in reproduction can actually incur a cost in terms of plasmatic oxidative stress. Therefore, reproduction is more likely to affect body maintenance when females with enlarged litters (FEL) are no longer able to tailor their initial level of investment to their experimentally enlarged litter size. Under natural conditions, reproduction may then become particularly costly in terms of future adult fitness only when females have to face unexpected and more demanding reproductive conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], either due to external (i.e. sudden environmental change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]) or internal factors (i.e. change in female conditions such as energy status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]). Still, oxidative stress in this study only differed significantly between females with reduced litters (FRL) and FEL (i.e. levels of Control females were intermediate and were not significantly different). This supports the idea that initial investment in reproduction is close to the maximal female reproductive potential (as FEL do not suffer more oxidative stress than Control ones), and remains close to the level initially programmed (as FRL do not suffer less oxidative stress than Control ones). This also lends support to a previous study, which showed that female bank voles raising a reduced number of offspring had the same survival rate or fecundity as Control females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is interesting to note that body mass did not seem to be a reliable marker of reproductive investment in mice, since females gained mass throughout reproduction in all groups (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]).</p><p>The characterization of systemic oxidative stress was an important step in our understanding of non-obligatory energy-derived trade-offs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Our proteomic strategy provided a broader picture of the oxidative state at the tissue level, which may be of key importance before drawing a final conclusion on the role of oxidative stress in any trade-offs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. However, a great number of proteins involved in the liver oxidative balance regulation (e.g. superoxide dismutase or other antioxidant proteins) were analysed here using proteomics, but we did not detect any significant change in their levels following litter size manipulation (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S1). Given the small sample size, our results have to be carefully interpreted but they suggest that hepatic oxidative stress is in our case unlikely to be involved in the cost of reproduction. This hypothesis is in accordance with recent studies in which no increase was observed in oxidative stress in the liver of wild mice after litter size manipulation, despite the use of multiple proxies to measure oxidative balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the aforementioned studies, superoxide dismutase activity had even increased and protein carbonylation and oxidation levels had decreased in the liver, indicating a rather low level of oxidative stress in females raising an enlarged litter size. In our study, the lack of a significant effect on such antioxidant proteins in the liver is unlikely to be attributable to a difference in experimental designs, since Garratt et al. used a comparable litter size manipulation, with similar average litter sizes (i.e. around 6 pups). Nevertheless, liver oxidative stress cannot be definitively ruled out as a reproductive cost by our data. For instance, antioxidant parameters like glutathione peroxidase and peroxiredoxins have previously been shown to vary with age in mice using a proteomic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. It may therefore be possible that a deleterious effect of our treatment would only occur in old reproductive females. In addition, the timing of sampling may be of importance in the detection of oxidative stress as a cost of reproduction related to litter size. Previous measurement of protein oxidation in mice indicated that levels of oxidative damage increased with litter size at peak lactation (day 17 after parturition) but not at weaning (day 28) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Finally, an alternative explanation remains, namely that enzymatic activity and protein expression are not directly linked. Therefore, while proteomics may highlight new protein targets, definitive conclusions about the implication of a given enzymatic pathway cannot be drawn without carrying out studies that perform functional tests or measure the proportion of intact/damaged protein forms (i.e. carbonylation levels of enzymes, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Non oxidative-related proteins affected by litter size manipulation</title><p>As regards litter size manipulation, our proteomic approach highlighted new mechanisms (i.e. other than oxidative stress) that may be involved in the cost of reproduction. Interestingly, some of these proteins are related to ageing. One of our most striking findings was that the levels of regucalcin (or senescence marker protein-30) were lower in the FEL than FRL group. A comparable reduction of regucalcin levels was previously observed in a senescence-accelerated mice strain and also in ageing rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Regucalcin plays a central role in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signalling pathways (e.g. cell apoptosis) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of protein activities and is involved in the protection of cells and organs from various deleterious factors, including oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Finally, knockout mice lacking regucalcin have a shortened lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], suggesting that this protein plays a corner-stone role in organism ageing and survival. In addition to being repressed (expression levels) in the FEL group of this study, regucalcin actually meets all the biological requirements for a component of one of the mechanisms sustaining the ageing cost of reproduction: (i) regucalcin is partly localized in the mitochondria (a central actor in ageing processes), (ii) its protein sequence appears to be highly conserved among vertebrates, and (iii) its expression is modulated by a myriad of different factors from hormones to lipopolysaccharide, all potential mediators of life-history traits. Thus, one can hypothesize a putative broader evolutionary role of regucalcin in any life-history trade-off implying ageing. This hypothesis deserves further studies in mammals but also in other taxa.</p><p>Our proteomic results also underline the modulated expression of a few additional proteins. The levels of glycine N-methyltransferase/malate dehydrogenase were down-regulated in females of the FEL compared to the Control group (Discriminant Analysis). This type of decrease in glycine N-methyltransferase and malate dehydrogenase was previously found either in senescence-accelerated mice strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] or simply with age ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]; see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] for a deleterious ageing impact on adenosylhomocysteinase levels), reinforcing the potential pro-ageing effect of our experimental litter enlargement. Decreased activities of mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation or in the transfer of co-enzymes through the mitochondrial membrane are actually concomitant to ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], suggesting a lower efficiency in the mitochondrial conversion of energy in ATP. However, malate dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle producing NADH, an essential cofactor for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylations. Malate dehydrogenase is also involved in fatty acid synthesis. Additionally, glycine N-methyltransferase plays a role in amino acid metabolism and controls methylation processes. It is therefore possible that the reduced levels of glycine N-methyltransferase/malate dehydrogenase in females from both the FRL and FEL groups may also be explained by other less or non-costly mechanisms such as a simple metabolic switch between the use of lipid fuels and amino acids.</p><p>Selenium-binding protein acts as a tumor-suppressor and is expressed more in healthy tissues than in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], thereby forming a possible indicator for the long-term effect of reproductive investment on adult survival. When compared to Control females, selenium-binding protein was found to be up-regulated in females for which litter size was reduced (PCA analysis). This suggests that raising less young than initially programmed would allow the mother to set up a better body protection. Interestingly, in addition to malate dehydrogenase, our analysis indicated that the expression of two other proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism were altered by litter size manipulations, with either a decreased level in the FEL group (alpha-enolase) or an increased level in the FRL group (fructose-1,6-biphosphatase 1), thus indicating a possible constraining effect of reproduction effort on the metabolism of carbohydrate fuels, or at least on these proteins. This indicates a potential alteration of glucose homeostasis following the mismatch between the female&#x02019;s projected reproductive investment and the actual size of the litter she has to rear. A similar observation has been made in 50-week old control and senescence-accelerated mice strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Importantly, as a putative ecological consequence of these changes in protein expression, fructose-1,6-biphosphatase 1 regulates blood glucose and a defect in its activity may ultimately lead to altered brain functions such as memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], a function of key importance in wild animals both in terms of foraging efficiency and predator avoidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Overall, it points out that altered glucose metabolism may also be one of the pathways through which reproduction is traded-off against ageing and the future survival/fecundity prospects of adults. We therefore encourage future studies to include measurements of glucose metabolism (and other energy metabolic pathways) as an interesting (and easily measured) variable to evaluate the consequences of reproduction. This is in line with the recent outlining of a potential connection between reproduction, fat metabolism and longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our results show that enlarging or reducing litter sizes in reproductive mice does not trigger any significant change in systemic oxidative stress levels in comparison to a control reproductive state. This suggests that mice initial investment in reproduction is close to a maximum and remains at a same level even if the energy demand of lactation is reduced. However, the significant difference between females with a reduced and enlarged litter size reveals that the degree of investment in reproduction can actually incur a cost in terms of plasmatic oxidative stress. Our proteomic data further show that hepatic oxidative stress is unlikely to be involved in the cost of reproduction, as expression levels of a series of proteins involved in the liver oxidative stress response are not affected by litter size manipulation. Importantly, liver proteomic data also enabled us to uncover that pro-ageing processes are new mechanisms underlying the cost of reproduction. As a consequence, this should generate interest of evolutionary biologists and ecophysiologists in the use of a proteomic approach to complement their studies of the mechanisms sustaining life-history trade-offs. The collection of data for proteomes and their variation among individuals responding to environmental challenges or stressful situations may reveal particular cellular or physiological networks which have a closer link with the individual phenotype. This multidisciplinary field of investigation opens up real possibilities for a more integrated view of evolutionary processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Experimental procedures</title><p>The experiment was conducted on females C57 black 6 (C57BL/6&#x000a0;J) from our own laboratory population.

The system was fully controlled by ChemStation (Rev B.01.035R1) and EsquireControl (v5.3) software (Agilent technologies and Bruker Daltonics, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Mass spectrometry data analysis and protein identifications</title><p>For protein identifications, MS/MS data were analyzed using two different algorithms, i.e. the Mascot&#x02122; v2.3.02 (Matrix Science, London, UK) installed on a local server and the OMSSA (Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm) program (v2.1.7, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]). Spectra were searched against a target-decoy version of the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> protein database downloaded from NCBInr (May 2011, 288050 target&#x02009;+&#x02009;decoy entries), with a mass tolerance of 0.25&#x000a0;Da in MS and MS/MS modes, and allowing a maximum of one trypsin missed cleavage. Optional modifications were set as follows: carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues, oxidation of methionine residues, and acetylation of protein N-termini. Database generation, OMSSA searches and automatic extraction of protein functional annotations (gene ontologies) were performed using our home-made &#x0201c;Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis&#x0201d; software suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p><p>We followed the guidelines for proteomic data publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], and to avoid any eventuality of poor quality data being considered, we applied stringent filtering criteria based on probability-based scoring of the identified peptides to obtain high confidence identifications. A target-decoy strategy was used to determine the false discovery rate of identifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. This was achieved using Scaffold software (v3.0.7, Proteome software Inc., Portland, OR, USA). Single peptide-based protein identifications were validated when MS/MS ion scores were higher than 55 (Mascot) and when &#x02013;logE values were higher than 8 (OMSSA). Multiple peptide-based protein identifications were validated when at least 2 peptides were detected with a MS/MS ion score higher than 20 (Mascot) and/or when &#x02013;logE values were higher than -2 (OMSSA). Common contaminants such as keratin and trypsin were not considered. Among the different proteins that were identified in a given spot, only the major (more abundant) ones were considered to be responsible for variations of spot intensities. The determination of major proteins was performed following a &#x0201c;peptide counting&#x0201d; strategy: the higher the number of peptides assigned to a given protein, the more abundant this protein is. More precisely, and while taking into account the fact that tryptic sites are followed or not by a Proline, the possible missed cleavages, the adequate size of peptides for their detection by mass spectrometry (i.e. peptides of 4 to 31 amino acids on the basis of our data), and also the results from two distinct search algorithms, we compared the theoretical number of detectable tryptic peptides to the experimental number we identified. The theoretical number of detectable tryptic peptides was similar for major (53&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2) and minor (53&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8) proteins in a given gel spot, and major proteins were identified with five times more peptides than minor ones (27&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2% vs. only 5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1% of the possible tryptic peptides, respectively).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Impact of litter size manipulation on reproductive female body mass was checked using a Mixed Model Analysis, with body mass as the dependent variable and Experimental Group (Control, FEL and FRL) as a fixed factor. Initial litter mass (measured before litter manipulation) was used as a covariate to control for initial investment in reproduction, and Time (before and after litter size manipulation) as repeated factor. Individual identity was added as a random factor to control for pseudo-replication. Effect of the experimental litter size manipulation on final oxidative stress of the females was checked using a one-way ANOVA, with antioxidant capacity used as a covariate to assess the oxidative stress level after controlling for any variation in individual antioxidant level.</p><p>In addition, we tested whether manipulating female current reproductive effort may have incurred a cost for the offspring in terms of lower body mass growth. To do so, final litter mass differences were tested using one-way ANOVA, with Experimental Group as a fixed factor and final litter size as a covariate to control for the number of offspring present in the litter. The significant effect of litter manipulation and litter size was also checked using a similar one-way ANOVA.</p><p>The proteomic data encompassed 287 different protein spots revealed on 2D-gels and corresponded to a total of 419 different proteins. Indeed, one protein spot can contain several different proteins. We chose to conduct two complementary statistical analyses and expected their convergent results to help us identify the main proteins affected by our experimental design. The first of these statistical procedures analysed data using multiple ANOVAs to detect spots that were significantly different among the three experimental groups (Control, FEL and FRL groups). By doing so, we were able to determine, among the large number of protein spots, those that were of interest in relation to our experimental treatment. Using these ANOVAs allowed us to restrict the numbers of variables to 7 protein spots. In a second step, we conducted a Principal Component Analysis on the 7 selected protein spots with orthogonal rotation (varimax, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]). The aim was to obtain two components (PC1 and PC2) that would largely explain the total variance. PC1 and PC2 indices were then used in an ANOVA analysis, with Litter Size Manipulation as a fixed factor, and litter size after manipulation (Final Litter Size) and female body mass at the end of the experiment (Final Female Body Mass) as covariates to control for absolute litter size effect (regardless of litter size manipulation) and for individual differences in female quality, respectively. Non-significant terms were dropped sequentially to obtain the final model we present.</p><p>To further disentangle the roles played by each protein found in PC1 and PC2 in the discrimination of the experimental groups, we used a Discriminant Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Combining the results from both tests enabled us to focus more particularly on just three proteins (alpha-enolase, Glycine N-methyltransferase and regucalcin; see Results section).</p><p>All analyses were conducted on SPSS 18.0. Variance homogeneity and the normal distribution of residuals were checked in each ANOVA test. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO value&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.55) and Bartlett&#x02019;s test of sphericity (testing whether correlations between variables were large enough for PCA, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) were verified in the Principal Component Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].
