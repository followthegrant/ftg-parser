Linezolid is useful against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>, vancomycin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and methicillin-resistant <italic>S aureus</italic>. Its mechanism of action is inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 23S ribosomal RNA in the 50S subunit, preventing fusion with the 30S subunit and formation of the initiation complex.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup></p><p>Linezolid-induced lactic acidosis has already been reported,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> especially after prolonged use (&#x02265;28 days). It is a serious adverse drug reaction that can result in multiorgan failure and death. We noticed that various linezolid treatments (range from 1 day<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> to 109 days)<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> can cause lactic acidosis. The incidence is relatively low but always life-threatening. Therefore, clinicians require relevant information, such as the risk factors and data from similar cases, to advice on the clinical use of linezolid. Many studies have been done, and the most frequently referenced one is research from Korea,<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> which had collected and analyzed reported cases of linezolid-induced lactic acidosis. They concluded that a long period of use is not a prerequisite for death.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> However, there were several limitations related to that research. First, the number of cases included was relatively small. Thirteen cases, 2 missed and 11 newly reported, were not included in that research. In addition, 2 duplicate cases presented in different literatures were not excluded.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Second, the data extraction was not precise and accurate enough. For example, &#x0201c;90 days&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> in the original literature was replaced by &#x0201c;12 weeks.&#x0201d; Moreover, several mistakes were found in converting from mg/dL to mmol/L, which resulted in incorrect concentrations of lactate. &#x0201c;59&#x0200a;mg/dL&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> should be converted to &#x0201c;6.5&#x0200a;mmol/L&#x0201d; instead of &#x0201c;5.9&#x0200a;mmol/L,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;113.4&#x0200a;mg/dL&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> was equal to &#x0201c;12.6&#x0200a;mmol/L&#x0201d; instead of &#x0201c;12.1&#x0200a;mmol/L,&#x0201d; etc. These limitations would result in inaccurate and, very likely, falsely negative conclusions. In addition, to our knowledge, there is no highly reliable study on the relationship between linezolid-induced lactic acidosis and age or gender.</p><p>Therefore, we searched for reported cases of linezolid-induced lactic acidosis and extracted the data accurately to evaluate the risk factors. In addition, we also report a life-threatening case of lactic acidosis after 3 doses of linezolid exposure.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Case report</title><p>A 57-year-old man was admitted to the Pneumology Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Ningbo University in December 2016 for cough and sputum production for half a month and hemoptysis for 1 day. He had a medical history of pulmonary aspergillosis and type 2 diabetes.</p><p>On admission, blood pressure was 125/76 mm Hg, the body temperature was 36.6&#x000b0;C, respiratory rate was 19&#x0200a;breaths/min, and heart rate was 79&#x0200a;beats/min. Results of laboratory tests included the following values: urea nitrogen 12.4&#x0200a;mmol/L, creatinine 139.7&#x0200a;&#x003bc;mol/L, uric acid 539&#x0200a;&#x003bc;mol/L, potassium 4.43&#x0200a;mmol/L, glucose 7.83&#x0200a;mmol/L, leukocytes 12 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L, with 75.6% neutrophils, hemoglobin 11.4&#x0200a;g/dL, lactic acid 1.9&#x0200a;mmol/L, and pH 7.37.</p><p>Intravenous voriconazole (200&#x0200a;mg q/12&#x0200a;h, first dose doubling) was used to treat pulmonary fungal infection. The results of a sputum smear examination showed gram-positive cocci+, gram-positive bacilli+, and gram-negative bacilli++. According to the results of sputum smear examination and the clinical manifestations, community-acquired pneumonia cannot be excluded and moxifloxacin (400&#x0200a;mg q/d) was added on day 3. Five days later, the patient presented with shortness of breath and became febrile up to 38.8&#x000b0;C. Chest radiography showed aggravated infection. Intravenous imipenem and cilastatin sodium (500&#x0200a;mg q/8&#x0200a;h) was substituted for moxifloxacin.</p><p>The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit on day 10 for severe pneumonia-induced respiratory failure. The antibiotic therapy was escalated to vancomycin. Because of poor renal function (estimated renal clearance 36&#x0200a;mL/min), intravenous linezolid (600&#x0200a;mg q/12&#x0200a;h) was introduced as an alternative treatment to vancomycin. After 3 doses of linezolid, the patient's blood lactate had risen up to 10.0&#x0200a;mmol/L, blood pressure was 50/40 mm Hg, heart rate was 42&#x0200a;beats/min, and creatinine was 335.8&#x0200a;&#x003bc;mol/L. Noradrenaline and dopamine were administered with a minipump to maintain a relatively normal pressure. As linezolid was implicated as a possible cause of the lactic acidosis, the agent was discontinued.</p><p>The patient required mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure and continuous renal replacement therapy for 6 days to normalize his blood pH and clear linezolid from his plasma. However, the lactic acidosis improved only marginally, and his blood pressure decreased to 30/22 mm Hg. The patient died on day 17.</p><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Data sources</title><p>We searched for cases of linezolid-induced lactic acidosis reported in English in PubMed from their inception until April 2017.

The treatment duration of linezolid was expressed in days in the calculations. The dosage of linezolid was assumed to be 600&#x0200a;mg/bid, when it was not reported according to the drug instruction. Only the lactic acidosis-related deaths were included when analyzing and evaluating the data. Patients &#x02265;65 years were defined as elderly according to the WHO's definition.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Data analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS software package (version 18.0).

However, as we known, metformin can cause lactic acidosis too. A research including 253 cases showed that the mortality of metformin-associated lactic acidosis was 17.2%.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> The mortality of linezolid-induced lactic acidosis was considered to be relatively high.</p><p>Our study found that the mortality did not increase as the duration of linezolid therapy increased. Therefore, we considered that the duration might not be a risk factor. However, mortalities at every cut-off day were extremely high. Therefore, we should pay attention to the patients&#x02019; vital signs, no matter when the patients suffered the linezolid-induced lactic acidosis.</p><p>The mortalities did not correlate with gender and age according to our statistical results. However, the proportions of male patients were significantly higher than female patients in both age groups. Male patients seemed to be more susceptible to linezolid-induced lactic acidosis. Notably, male patients had twice the mortalities compared with female patients in both age groups.</p><p>Because the action mechanism of linezolid is related closely to the mitochondrion, we suspected that a gene might play a key role and that the linezolid-induced acid acidosis might be genetic. We thought that this may explain why the duration of linezolid was not a risk factor when gender might be related to lactic acidosis. As early as 2004, a research report from Taiwan indicated that there was a very strong association between the HLA-B&#x02217;1502 allele and carbamazepine-induced Stevens&#x02013;Johnson syndrome.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> If there exists a specific gene that is related to linezolid-induced lactic acidosis, screening for that gene can be performed prior to initiation of linezolid treatment to prevent the occurrence of linezolid-induced lactic acidosis. However, as far as we know, limited genetic association studies have been performed. For example, Palenzuela et al<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> investigated potential for contribution from mitochondrial polymorphisms. Therefore, further studies between different races, families, and alleles seem to be needed.</p><p>This study has a number of limitations. First is the relatively small sample size. Therefore, more relevant cases need to be reported to support further evaluation, and more studies with larger numbers are needed to certify our results. Second, as this was a case review study, we cannot exclude confounding factors such as disease severity. Thus, some bias may exist in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, the mortality of linezolid-induced lactic acidosis was considered to be relatively high. Duration of linezolid therapy might not be a risk factor for death related to linezolid-induced lactic acidosis. The mortalities did not correlate with gender and age according to the statistical results. However, male patients had high mortality from linezolid-induced lactic acidosis. Linezolid's potential-associated lactic acidosis requires systematic monitoring during clinical therapy. The genetic factor could be considered in future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the authors of the included articles for their thoughtful work.
