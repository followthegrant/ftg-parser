NKG2D is a strong activating receptor for NK cells and a co-stimulatory receptor for T cells. NKG2D signal transduction depends on DNAX-activating protein 10 (DAP10). Here, we introduced the cytoplasmic domain of DAP10 into the second-generation CARs M28z and G28z to generate M28z10 and G28z10, which target mesothelin (MSLN) and glypican 3 (GPC3), respectively. T cells expressing M28z10 or G28z10 showed enhanced and prolonged effector function against MSLN+&#x000a0;lung cancer or GPC3+&#x000a0;hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines in culture and secreted elevated levels of cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3;, granzyme B, and GM-CSF. In addition, M28z10 CAR-T cells showed greater anti-tumor activity than those expressing M28z in both A549 cell line xenografts and human lung cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Similarly, G28z10 exhibited higher efficacy in causing tumor regression than did G28z in hepatocellular carcinoma PDX. Therefore, our results show that DAP10 signaling contributes to the function of CAR-T cells in both lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma and can enhance the efficacy of CAR-T cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>CAR-T</kwd><kwd>NKG2D</kwd><kwd>DAP10</kwd><kwd>mesothelin</kwd><kwd>glypican 3</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)</named-content></funding-source><award-id>81522002, 81773301</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">science and technology planning project of guangdong province</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2017B030314056</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This paper/achievement is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) - 81522002, 81773301; The Strategic Priority Research Programof the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant No. XDB19030205, No. XDA12050305; The Natural Science Fund of Guangdong Province: Distinguished Young Scholars (Grant No.: 2014A030306028), Doctoral Foundation (Grant No.: 2017A030310381) The National Major Scientific and Technological Special Project for &#x0201c;Significant New Drugs Development&#x0201d; (Grant No.: SQ2018ZX090201), The Guangdong Provincial Applied Science and Technology Research&#x00026; Development Program (Grant No.: 2016B020237006), The Frontier and key technology innovation special grant from the Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong province, (2015B020227003), (2014B020225005), (2016B030229006).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><ref-count count="49"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>In recent years, the clinical application of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) has achieved considerable success in the treatment of hematological malignancies, including CD19-positive B cell acute leukemi.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref></sup> CARs contain an extracellular ScFv fragment recognizing tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), the CD3z intracellular T cell-activating domain and co-stimulatory domains such as those derived from CD28 and 4-1BB.

In addition, NKG2D is expressed by CD8&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;T cells and reportedly serves as a co-stimulatory receptor for CD8&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;T cells. The membrane localization and signal transduction of NKG2D in T cells depend on another membrane protein, DNAX-activating protein 10 (DAP10). DAP10 contains a YxxM signaling motif, which may activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref></sup> Despite the roles of NKG2D and DAP10 signaling on T cells have been extensively studie,<sup><xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref></sup> the effect of DAP10 activation in the second-generation CAR-T cells, which generally utilize a CD28 or 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain, remains unknown. We hypothesized that DAP10 activation can improve the anti-tumor activity of second-generation CAR-T cells based on previous reports. To test this hypothesis, we generated anti-mesothelin (MSLN) and anti-glypican 3 (GPC3) CAR vectors containing the DAP10 cytoplasmic domain, CD28 and 4-1BB. We compared the function of CAR-T cells with or without the DAP10 cytoplasmic domain using in vitro functional assays and in vivo xenograft mouse models. Our results reveal that DAP10 incorporation enhances the effector function and anti-tumor capacity of second-generation CAR-T cells in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>DAP10 incorporation in second-generation anti-msln cars enhanced anti-tumor activity in vitro</title><p>We generated second-generation anti-MSLN CAR-T cells with a CD3z activating domain and a CD28 cytoplasmic domain (M28z) as previously reporte.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref></sup> To confirm the expression of NKG2D and DAP10 in CAR-T cells, we detected NKG2D expression on in vitro-expanded CAR-T cells by FACS, and most of the expression was detected on CD8+&#x000a0;CAR-T cells (Supplementary <xref rid="F0001">Figure 1A</xref>).

We then sought to determine if DAP10 incorporation in the CAR vectors affects the anti-tumor activity of CAR-T cells. We transduced these constructs into primary human T cells and found no difference in transduction efficiency in the M28z and M28z10 groups (Supplementary <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). Then, we tested the in vitro killing capacity of these CAR-T cells. Specifically, GFP, M28z, M28z10, Mbbz, and Mbbz10&#x000a0;T cells were co-cultured with human lung cancer cell lines, including A549GL, H460GL and MSLN-overexpressing H460GL cells, at the indicated effector to target (E:T) ratio for 18&#x000a0;hours, and target cell viability was then determined by measuring luciferase activity with a 450-nm laser in a luminometer. The results showed that the cytotoxicity of M28z10 was greater than that of M28z in A549GL and H460GL MSLN+&#x000a0;target cells, while there was no difference in cytotoxicity against H460GL cells, which do not express MSLN (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1B</xref>). To determine the levels of cytokine secretion by these different CAR-T cells, the supernatant of T cells co-cultured with A549GL cells was collected for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis.

A moderate elevation of PD-1 expression was detected, which also suggests enhanced T cell activation (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2D</xref>).
