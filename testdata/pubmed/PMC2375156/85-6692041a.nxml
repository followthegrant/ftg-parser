Recently, 2 methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins have been linked to gene inactivation by their ability to recruit co-repressors and HDAC-activity to methylated gene promoters. Here, we have analysed mRNA expression of these genes, <italic>MeCP2</italic> and <italic>MBD2</italic>, in a wide variety of primary human tumours. In solid tumours, expression levels of <italic>MBD2</italic> (57/71) and <italic>MeCP2</italic> (64/71) were significantly reduced in the majority of primary tumours as detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Western blot analyses of MeCP2 in matched tumour&#x02013;normal samples of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) indicated reduced protein in a significant percentage of patients. In acute myelogenous leukaemia (<italic>n</italic> = 26), expression levels were only slightly reduced and did not differ between samples analysed at diagnosis or at the time of relapse. In early-stage NSCLC (<italic>n</italic> = 70) expression of MeCP2 and MBD2 was significantly lower in squamous cell carcinoma than in adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.01). To further elucidate the mechanisms of gene regulation, we analysed MeCP2 and MBD2 regulation during haematopoietic differentiation. No significant changes in MeCP2 or MBD2 expression were found when NB4 cells were differentiated toward granulocytes suggesting that neither differentiation nor cell cycle status were relevant for the reduced expression of these genes in human cancer. In conclusion, the significant loss of MeCP2 and MBD2 expression in human cancers suggests a potential role of this phenomenon in the development of solid human tumours. &#x000a9; 2001 Cancer Research Campaign<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.bjcancer.com">&#x02002;&#x02002;http://www.bjcancer.com</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CpG-methylation</kwd><kwd><italic>MeCP2</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>MBD2</italic></kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
