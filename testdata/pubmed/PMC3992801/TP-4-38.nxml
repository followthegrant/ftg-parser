The standard method being infection of laboratory animals and subsequent parasite species identification based on the morphology of the adult worms, but this method is laborious and time consuming.</p><p>Nevertheless, the importance of discriminating <italic>S. haematobium</italic> from other species later led to the development of molecular approaches such as isoenzyme profiling,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Southern blot analysis employing recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) gene probes,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] randomly amplified DNA[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the internal transcribed spacer 2 region.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In addition, a tandemly repeated DNA sequence termed <italic>Dra1</italic> was recently identified in the genome of <italic>S. heamatobium</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Although <italic>Dra1</italic> was not found in <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> or <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic> even by dot hybridization, however, it was observed that this gene is also present in the genome of other schistosomes belonging to the <italic>S. haematobium</italic> group.

These results will also allow extension of large-scale PCR monitoring approaches for snails infected with <italic>S. haematobium</italic>,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] which had been previously limited to areas where cross-reacting <italic>Dra1</italic> containing animal schistosome species were absent or very rare. However, further validation of the assay is required for field studies since only a few field-collected snails were examined in this study. Such validation should include a whole range of infected and uninfected snails with different signal intensities so as to assess the range of sensitivity among field-collected snails.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by TWAS-USM Visiting Researcher Fellowship (FR Number: 3240255153) awarded to AOP.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chitsulo</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Engels</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Montresor</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Savioli</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The global status of schistosomiasis and its control</article-title><source>Acta Trop</source><year>2000</year><volume>77</volume><fpage>41</fpage><lpage>51</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10996119</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab>World Health Organization</collab><article-title>Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis and Soil-Transmitted Helminthiasis</article-title><source>WHO Technical Series Report 912</source><year>2002</year><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc><publisher-name>WHO</publisher-name><fpage>72</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>WHO Expert Committee.
