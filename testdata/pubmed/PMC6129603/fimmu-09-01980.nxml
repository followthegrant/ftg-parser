Although sex hormones regulate adaptive immune cells, which explains sex differences in immunity and infection, little information is available about the effects of androgens on neutrophils. We therefore aimed to examine neutrophil recruitment and plasticity in androgen&#x02013;dependent and &#x02013;independent sites under androgen manipulation. By using a bacterial model of prostate inflammation, we showed that neutrophil recruitment was higher in testosterone-treated rats, with neutrophil accumulation being positively correlated to serum levels of testosterone and associated to stronger inflammatory signs and tissue damage. Testosterone also promoted LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment to the prostate, peritoneum, and liver sinusoids, as revealed by histopathology, flow cytometry, and intravital microscopy. Strikingly, neutrophils in presence of testosterone exhibited an impaired bactericidal ability and a reduced myeloperoxidase activity. This inefficient cellular profile was accompanied by high expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL10 and TGF&#x003b2;1, which is compatible with the &#x0201c;N2-like&#x0201d; neutrophil phenotype previously reported in the tumor microenvironment. These data reveal an intriguing role for testosterone promoting inefficient, anti-inflammatory neutrophils that prolong bacterial inflammation, generating a pathogenic environment for several conditions. However, these immunomodulatory properties might be beneficially exploited in autoimmune and other non-bacterial diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>testosterone</kwd><kwd>androgens</kwd><kwd>bacterial prostatitis</kwd><kwd>infection</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="55"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="8864"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neutrophil granulocytes lead the initial leukocyte influx to sites of injury in order to eliminate invading pathogens or damaged tissues. Their response is mediated by phagocytosis and NETosis, as well as by releasing defensins, enzymes, and cytokines to active the immune response (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Subsequently, once the inflammatory stimuli has been eradicated, neutrophils die by apoptosis and the elimination of apoptotic bodies by macrophages ensures the correct resolution of the inflammatory process and tissue repair (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, if the inflammatory process is not controlled, the products generated by neutrophils can induce multiple tissue alterations and loss of cellular function (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This is particularly important in endotoxemia- and burn-induced multiple organ dysfunction and in unresolved infections of the reproductive tract, where neutrophil activation could be harmful causing degradation of the extracellular matrix and additional gamete damage beyond that associated with the initial injury (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Although for decades it was thought that neutrophils constitute a homogeneous cell population, reports of neutrophils showing different behaviors in front of diverse steady state and pathological conditions are shifting this notion (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). For instance, neutrophils are able to shape and regulate immune and inflammatory responses against tumor cells by exerting either pro-tumor or anti-tumor effects on tumor development (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Given these varied effects, the concept of neutrophil plasticity and diversity has emerged, leading to the paradigm of anti-tumoral &#x0201c;N1 neutrophils&#x0201d; vs. pro-tumoral &#x0201c;N2 neutrophils&#x0201d; proposed by Fridlender and coworkers (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), in neoplastic scenarios. However, little is known about different neutrophil phenotypes promoted by non-tumoral environments as metabolic or hormonal imbalance.</p><p>The prostate gland is the main target of infectious and inflammatory diseases in the male reproductive tract, with prostatic inflammation representing a worldwide health issue. Moreover, a strong relationship between prostatitis and other conditions with high impact on human health such as male infertility (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), benign prostatic hyperplasia (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and prostate cancer (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) has been reported. Unlike many organs in the body, the prostate is under the strict control of testicular male hormones for its development and function. Hence, it is not surprising that testosterone might influence the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, as well as the local production of cytokines and chemokines, the recruitment and activation of immune cells, and the outcome of infectious diseases of the prostate gland. In this sense, we previously reported that testosterone negatively modulates the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway and downregulates antimicrobial substances in prostatic cells, which correlates with a decreased inhibition of bacterial growth in the presence of testosterone in both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>It has long been recognized that androgens dampen host defenses through multiple mechanisms of the adaptive immunity, explaining the sex-specific biases reported in immunocompetence, autoimmunity, and cancer incidence (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Androgenic effects include apoptosis of T and B cells and the induction of T regulatory cells and CD8+ suppressive cells (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Additionally, in monocytes/macrophages, androgens reduce proinflammatory signaling (TLR4, TNF&#x003b1;, IL1&#x003b2;, and IL6) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) but enhance anti-inflammatory (IL10) cytokine production (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Regarding innate immunity, a few published articles have suggested that testosterone maintains a reduced expression of key elements such as TLRs and modulates the activity of different professional cells (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Nevertheless, the influence of androgen levels on neutrophil activity and plasticity in the initial inflammatory response remains to be investigated. Therefore, the aim of this work was to determine whether testosterone is able to modulate neutrophil recruitment and behavior in androgen dependent- and independent-sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Wistar strain male rats, 12 weeks old, and weighing 250&#x02013;350 g, were housed at the Animal Research Facility of the Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, in air-conditioned quarters, under a controlled photoperiod (14 h light/10 h darkness) with free access to rodent food and tap water. C57BL/6 mice were from Centro de Bioterismo in Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (CEBIO, UFMG, Brazil).

Sterile saline-injected animals were used as controls. Animals were anesthetized 4 h after thioglycollate or 12 h after LPS injection and the peritoneal lavage was harvested for analysis by injection of 10 mL of sterile PBS containing 0.835 UI/mL sodium heparin. The abdomen was gently massaged and the blood-free cell suspension was carefully aspirated with a syringe. The cell suspension was then spun for 6 min, 300 &#x000d7; g, at 20&#x000b0;C.

The cell pellet was washed and resuspended in 2 ml HBSS and total leukocyte counts were performed immediately in peritoneal lavage samples using a Neubauer chamber. To evaluate the neutrophil percentage, the differential leukocyte population was analyzed in cytospins after May-Gr&#x000fc;nwald-Giemsa staining (Biopur, Rosario, Argentina); a minimum of 500 leukocytes were counted, containing &#x0003e;85% pure populations of neutrophils.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, the prostate from rats supplemented with testosterone exhibited a massive neutrophil infiltration and invasion into the prostatic acini; this effect was more evident at day 5 post-infection. Moreover, serum androgen levels positively correlated to the number of neutrophils infiltrating the gland (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In contrast, rats with low testosterone levels displayed reduced inflammatory signs, with few focal infiltrates in the prostatic interstitium. Accordingly, the prostatic levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, SP-D, and HBD-1 were higher in rats treated with high doses of testosterone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), demonstrating a stronger inflammatory reaction in these animals. Considering the deleterious effects of neutrophils on tissue function, we assessed the histoarchitecture as well as the expression of prostatic binding protein (PBP) and &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2, markers of epithelial secretory function and stromal integrity respectively) of the prostate gland. At day 5 post-infection, both the secretory and the stromal compartments of the ventral prostate were conserved in the castrated animals as judged by PBP and ACTA2 expressions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). This was consistent with the conservation of ultrastructural features, including a prominent Golgi complex, developed endoplasmic reticulum, and secretory vesicles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Conversely, the epithelial layer of the testosterone-treated rats exhibited atrophy, desquamation, and invasion of neutrophils, suggesting that the exacerbated presence of neutrophils is associated to more inflammatory signs and tissue damage in the prostate gland of animals with high levels of testosterone.

Males are at higher risk of developing acute respiratory distress, sepsis, and multiorgan failure after traumatic hemorrhagic shock and thermal injury, in part due to abnormal activation of neutrophils (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although morphological differences in granulocytes from men and women have been known since 1954 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), the need to expose factors explaining functional differences has resurfaced recently in order to adapt new treatments depending on the characteristics of the pathophysiological process in each sex. In this sense, various studies have uncovered important immune regulatory functions for androgens, including effects on neutrophil accumulation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), maturation, activation (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and survival (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In line with this evidence, we here report that testosterone increases local chemokine expression, leading to a higher recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection, but at the same time, these cells exhibit a &#x0201c;N2-like&#x0201d; phenotype with a reduced efficiency in killing bacteria and high expression of immunomodulatory molecules such as IL10 and TGF&#x003b2;1.</p><p>Neutrophil recruitment is an important early step in inflammatory response against pathogenic invasion or sterile tissue damage. The recruitment of neutrophils into the tissue is initiated by neutrophil-active chemoattractants, mainly CXCR2 ligands CXCL1 and CXCL2, released from danger signal-activated professional tissue-resident sentinel cells or stromal cells (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Recruited neutrophils into injury site can also deliver active chemokines directly contributing to their own recruitment (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In the present study, we observed that the presence of testosterone leads to an increased bacterial-induced mRNA expression of CXCL1 and CXCL2, which was associated to a higher neutrophil recruitment. In agreement, androgen supplementation has been shown to augment neutrophil infiltration in penile urethroplasty (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and after myocardial infarction in both male and females (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Human studies demonstrated that decreasing testosterone levels results in an attenuation of exercise-induced neutrophil accumulation in muscles (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), indicating a strong positive correlation between androgen levels and neutrophil infiltration. Furthermore, hyperandrogenemia is associated to a higher neutrophil count in steady state conditions in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The excessive or aberrant neutrophil infiltration in the presence of high androgen levels seems to favor tissue damage and organ dysfunction not only after infection but also in non-infectious conditions (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, novel evidence suggests that neutrophil accumulation could also play a positive role in organ homeostasis by resolving inflammation (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), with a phenotypic characterization (i.e., pro-inflammatory vs. pro-resolving neutrophils) being necessary in order to predict the final effect of these cells on damage progression and tissue function.</p><p>Unlike other immune cells, existence of clearly defined neutrophils subtypes remains unclear.

Of note, IFN&#x003b2; and TGF&#x003b2;1 induce neutrophils to acquire anti-tumoral (N1) or pro-tumoral (N2) phenotypes respectively (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). N2 neutrophils are postulated to have a main role in promoting tumoral growth by increasing extracellular matrix deposition and by dampening a proper immune response (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In this context, TGF&#x003b2;1 appears as a central player in the tumor microenvironment orchestrating diverse pro-tumoral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory actions, including the induction and maintenance of an N2 phenotype. The induction of &#x0201c;N2-like&#x0201d; neutrophils in the presence of testosterone in our study can also be explained by overexpression of TGF&#x003b2;1 since its promoter activity is directly regulated by androgens through the androgen receptor (AR) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). However, whether TGF&#x003b2;1 acts directly or by other mechanisms to induce N2 neutrophil maturation by androgens deserves further research.</p><p>The ability of androgens to promote anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory phenotypes has been previously recognized for professional immune cells (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In general, testosterone tends to inhibit pro-inflammatory molecules such as TNF&#x003b1;, iNOS, and NO whereas induces IL10 and TGF&#x003b2;1 anti-inflammatory signaling (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Accordingly, we found that androgens favor a higher IL10 and TGF&#x003b2;1 expression along with a lower IL12 expression on recruited neutrophils. Strikingly, this phenotype was accompanied by a reduction in both MPO activity and bactericidal ability <italic>in vivo</italic> as well as <italic>ex vivo</italic>, resulting in an inadequate bacterial clearance. In accordance, it has been reported that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, testosterone decreases the microbicidal activity of human neutrophils by dampening the production of reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In contrast, after trauma or burn injury, androgens have been reported to enhance neutrophil activation in blood, as judged by CD11b expression and respiratory burst activity (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), which might explain why males are more susceptible to acute shock aggressiveness than females. These ambivalent results could be attributed to the type of stimuli used and the pathological conditions, with scarce data available on the bactericidal ability of neutrophils after androgen manipulation. In any case, the promotion of &#x0201c;N2-like&#x0201d; neutrophils by androgens may be deleterious as well as favorable, depending on the particular context; albeit being inefficient in killing bacteria, their ability to generate TGF&#x003b2;1, as described before (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), could be beneficial in repairing tissues and resolving inflammation (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that testosterone modulates neutrophil activity within the prostate and in androgen-independent sites as well. In a bacterial milieu, testosterone promotes, in a dose dependent manner, a recruitment of malfunctioning neutrophil that amplifies and prolongs the inflammatory response, with the persistence of their toxic products destroying cellular components and generating a favorable environment for the development of pathologies (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). On the other hand, the testosterone-induced anti-inflammatory profile displayed by these neutrophils could be beneficial in some non-bacterial types of inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>MS and AQ performed most protocols.
