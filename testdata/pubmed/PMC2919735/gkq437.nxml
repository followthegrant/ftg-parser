RNAs that small and as part of total bacterial RNA extracts usually escape detection by northern blotting. The approach combines LNA probes 5&#x02032;-digoxigenin-endlabeled for non-radioactive probe detection with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide-mediated chemical crosslinking of RNAs to nylon membranes, and necessitates the use of native PAGE either with the TBE or MOPS buffer system.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The discovery of small regulatory RNAs in all domains of life and their multi-faceted key roles in cell biology has propelled advances in technologies for their analysis. This includes the use of LNA probes in hybridization approaches to increase sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), development of the looped-primer RT&#x02013;PCR technique to quantify mature miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), as well as high-throughput methods such as RNomics to generate cellular RNA libraries for deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) or miRNA profiling arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Despite these advances, the classic northern blot technique has remained irreplaceable, since the approach allows the researcher to visualize and roughly quantify cellular levels of RNAs and their processing intermediates relative to endogenous RNA standards (e.g. 5S rRNA). The northern blot has even gained importance owing to the growing number of small RNA candidates identified by high-throughput and bioinformatic methods, which need to be verified experimentally. Recently, Hamilton and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) reported the use of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) to covalently couple small RNAs via their 5&#x02032;-phosphates to amino groups at the surface of nylon membranes. Relative to the standard UV crosslinking to nylon membranes, this reportedly 5&#x02032;-end-selective attachment enhanced the detection of RNAs &#x0003c;40 nt 25- to 50-fold. The likely reason is that UV crosslinking to the free amines of nylon membranes occurs via the bases (primarily uracil) which, in contrast to immobilization via the phosphate, sterically blocks accessibility of the immobilized nucleic acid for hybridization, particularly in the case of small RNAs owing to their limited interaction surface. Furthermore, the number and positions of UV-crosslinked bases vary depending on the particular RNA sequence and the applied UV crosslinking conditions (length of irradiation, UV light intensity), making UV crosslinking a process that is hard to control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>We were faced with the limitations of standard northern blot protocols when trying to detect small so-called product RNAs (pRNAs, &#x0223c;14 nt in length) in total RNA extracts from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>; pRNAs are short transcripts synthesized by bacterial RNA polymerases in an RNA-dependent RNA polymerization reaction using 6S RNA as template. 6S RNA, &#x0223c;200 nt in size, has been identified as a growth-phase dependent riboregulator of bacterial transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, this RNA acts by complex formation with the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> housekeeping RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme (E&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>) and accumulates during stationary phase. 6S RNA is primarily helical, with a large single-stranded loop in the center. This highly conserved secondary structure is essential for the ability of 6S RNA to form stable complexes with E&#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and to serve as a template for the synthesis of pRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Synthesis of these short transcripts leads to dissociation of 6S RNA&#x02013;RNAP complexes. In contrast to <italic>E. coli</italic> with only one 6S RNA gene, the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome harbors two 6S RNA homologs, termed 6S-1 and 6S-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Both RNAs were co-immunoprecipitated with the &#x003c3;<sup>A</sup> housekeeping RNAP holoenzyme using antibodies against &#x003c3;<sup>A</sup> or the &#x003b1; subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Our identification of 8- to 15-mer pRNAs derived from transcription on 6S-1 RNA as template in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> by a deep sequencing approach (unpublished results), but the failure to detect those by northern blotting, prompted us to explore improved northern blot protocols tailored to the detection of cellular RNAs as small as 14 nt.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> 168 and PY79, <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655, and 6S RNA knockout strains <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PY79 &#x00394;<italic>bsrA</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 &#x00394;<italic>ssrS</italic> were grown in LB medium at 37&#x000b0;C.

Phenol extraction was repeated, followed by chloroform (1+1) extraction and ethanol precipitation.

For specific detection of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> 5S rRNA loading controls and for <italic>E. coli</italic> 6S RNA, antisense transcripts covering the respective full-length RNA and internally labeled with digoxigenin-UTP were synthesized from PCR templates by T7 RNA polymerase (according to the DIG RNA Labeling Mix protocol provided by Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). For native PAGE, samples were adjusted to 1&#x000d7; native loading buffer by mixing with 6&#x000d7; native loading buffer [0.25% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 0.25% (w/v) xylene cyanol blue, 30% (v/v) glycerol]. For denaturing PAGE, samples were adjusted to 1&#x000d7; denaturing loading buffer [0.01% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 0.01% (w/v) xylene cyanol blue, 1.3 M urea, 33% (v/v) formamide, 1&#x000d7; TBE]. Before gel loading, samples were heated to 95&#x000b0;C for 3 min, followed by immediate cooling on ice. Generally, 10 or 20% polyacrylamide gels were used for RNA separation under native or denaturing conditions. For native PAGE, gel solutions as well as electrophoresis buffers either contained 89 mM Tris, 89 mM borate and 2 mM EDTA (TBE buffer system) or 20 mM MOPS&#x02013;NaOH, pH 7, (MOPS&#x02013;NaOH buffer system). For denaturing PAGE, gel solutions as well as electrophoresis buffers either contained 89 mM Tris, 89 mM borate, 2 mM EDTA and 8 M urea (TBE buffer system) or 20 mM MOPS&#x02013;NaOH, pH 7 and 2% formaldehyde (MOPS&#x02013;NaOH buffer system). RNA was blotted on positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Diagnostics) overnight using a semi-dry blotter with 3.75 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and 0.5&#x000d7; TBE as transfer buffer. To add a 5&#x02032;-phosphate to the chemically synthesized pRNAs, the oligonucleotide was incubated with ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Efficiency of phosphorylation was analyzed on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (TBE buffer system), with the 5&#x02032;-phosphorylated oligonucleotide migrating faster than the 5&#x02032;-OH variant owing to its extra negative charge; pRNAs with 5&#x02032;-OH and 5&#x02032;-phosphate were subjected to preparative co-electrophoresis, followed by gel excision and gel elution in 1 M Na(OAc) pH 4.9. Finally, pRNAs were concentrated by ethanol precipitation.

</p></sec><sec><title>Hybridization and detection</title><p>Classical RNA immobilization was performed by incubation of the wet membrane at 80&#x000b0;C for 30 min and storage at 4&#x000b0;C. Alternatively, EDC crosslinking was utilized to detect very small RNAs, exactly as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Briefly, 245 &#x000b5;l of 12.5 M 1-methylimidazole (Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) were added to 9 ml of double-distilled water and the pH was adjusted to 8.0 using HCl. Directly prior to use, 0.75 g EDC [1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide, Sigma Aldrich] were added and the volume was adjusted to 24 ml with double-distilled water. The wet membrane was placed on a Whatman paper soaked with EDC solution (160 mM EDC, 130 mM 1-methylimidazole pH 8.0), wrapped in plastic foil and incubated for 2 h at 60&#x000b0;C. After careful washing with water, the membrane was stored at 4&#x000b0;C. For pre-hybridization, 7 ml of hybridization solution (termed &#x02018;DIG Easy Hyb Granules&#x02019;, Roche Diagnostics) were heated to 50&#x000b0;C (in the case of DIG-LNA/DNA mixmer probes) or 68&#x000b0;C (in the case of T7 transcript probes &#x0003e;100 nt) and added to the membrane in a hybridization tube (avoid sticking of the membrane to the tube wall), followed by slow rotation in an hybridization oven for 2 h at 50 or 68&#x000b0;C, respectively. Probes, either 10 &#x000b5;l T7 transcript or 300 pmol DIG-LNA/DNA mixmer, were denatured for 3 min at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by immediate transfer on ice. The probe was then added to 7 ml pre-heated (50 or 68&#x000b0;C) hybridization solution to replace the pre-hybridization solution. Hybridization was conducted for at least 6 h, usually overnight, at 50 or 68&#x000b0;C under slow rotation in a hybridization oven. In some cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A) the (pre-)hybridization temperature for LNA/DNA mixmer probes was increased (depending on the probe&#x02019;s G/C content and extent of LNA modification) in order to suppress non-specific signals. Immunological detection of RNA was performed according to the instructions of the DIG Northern Starter Kit (Roche Diagnostics). X-ray films (Kodak BioMax Light Film, Sigma Aldrich) were exposed to the membrane for chemiluminescence detection (usually 20&#x02013;45 min). Developed X-ray films were scanned (BioRad GS-800) for documentation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>From a deep sequencing library we knew that pRNA transcripts, predominantly 8&#x02013;15 nt in length, accumulate in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells under conditions of outgrowth from stationary phase (unpublished results, manuscript in preparation). The pRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase using 6S-1 RNA as the template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). However, we and others (J&#x000f6;rg Vogel, personal communication) had been unable to detect pRNA transcripts by northern blot analysis. Such an example, where we used 20% PAGE/8 M urea and classical &#x02018;baking&#x02019; of the membrane at 80&#x000b0;C for RNA immobilization, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (comparable results were obtained with UV crosslinking; data not shown). Although we employed an LNA/DNA mixmer probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) for efficient hybridization, no endogenous pRNA signal could be detected in up to 20 &#x000b5;g of total RNA from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells at 3 min of outgrowth from stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;8). Yet, when gels were loaded with 0.5, 1 or 5 ng of a chemically synthesized pRNA 14-mer, signals were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Likewise, a signal of similar intensity as in lane 3 (5 ng pRNA) was observed when 5 ng of the pRNA 14-mer were added to 5 &#x000b5;g of total cellular RNA from outgrowth bacteria (lane 4). These findings admitted different explanations: (i) endogenous pRNA levels were below the sensitivity level of the applied northern blot setup; (ii) endogenous pRNAs might be masked in the context of total cellular RNA extracts owing to their association with 6S-1 RNA; non-specific masking could be excluded based on the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, lanes 4 and 5.

Moreover, the necessity of denaturing conditions for electrophoretic separation according to size is certainly less mandatory for short RNA oligonucleotides compared with larger and more structured RNAs. To address these points, we performed northern blots with native and denaturing PAA gels, either using the 1&#x000d7; TBE or the MOPS buffer system, and applying EDC crosslinking for RNA coupling to the nylon membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In the case of native but not denaturing conditions, we were now able to detect endogenous pRNAs in total RNA extract from outgrowth bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 6). The endogenous pRNA signal co-migrated with the chemically synthesized pRNA 14-mer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Assuming that the 5&#x02032;-end groups (5&#x02032;-OH for the chemically synthesized pRNA, 5&#x02032;-triphosphate for the endogenous pRNA) had little effect on gel mobility in native 10% PAA gels, our results suggest that the bulk of endogenous pRNAs transcribed from 6S-1 RNA have sizes of &#x0223c;14 nt, in line with the prevalence of 8- to 15-mer sequence reads in our deep sequencing library (data not shown). The absence of an endogenous pRNA signal in the presence of 8 M urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 10 versus 5) or 2% formaldehyde (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 12 versus 6) can be explained by urea competing with amino groups at the membrane surface for reaction with EDC and formaldehyde reacting with membrane amino groups which then become unavailable to reaction with the EDC crosslinker.

Additionally, total RNA prepared from stationary phase cells was loaded onto the gels (lanes 5 and 11); endogenous pRNA in the outgrowth RNA fraction was again only detectable under native conditions (compare lanes 6 and 12). Note that PAGE with MOPS and formaldehyde generally resulted in less efficient separation of RNAs according to size. Film exposition times were 20&#x02013;45 min; the two part figures in panel A originate from the same blot and exposed film; exposition time in panel B slightly differed from that in panel A; criterion for exposition length was good visibility of the pRNA signal (lane 5 in panel A, lane 6 in panel B), thus often two or more films were exposed to the same blot for different periods of time to optimize blot performance.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkq437f3"/></fig></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lanes 5 and 10, additional signals of RNAs larger than pRNA were observed; less additional signals were observed in the corresponding lanes 6 and 12 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, but here a another total RNA preparation from outgrowth bacteria was used. Thus, we attribute this difference to variations in the quality of RNA preparations. Yet, to rule out that the observed differences were related to the type of PAA buffer system, we used the same RNA preparation as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B for native PAGE blots, either TBE or MOPS buffered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Here, only signals attributable to 6S-1 RNA (owing to the probe&#x02019;s complementarity to seven consecutive nucleotides of 6S-1 RNA; nt 151&#x02013;157 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) and endogenous pRNA were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, lanes 6 and 12), indicating that the quality of the total RNA preparation rather than the buffer system determines the extent of non-specific signals.

Both questions were simultaneously addressed by designing the variant pRNA mut with two consecutive base exchanges relative to the wild-type 6S-1 pRNA; the two point mutations generated the potential of the 14-mer to form a small hairpin structure with a 3-bp stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, top). The two chemically synthesized pRNA variants were separated on a 20% native PAA gel (TBE buffer system), followed by northern blotting using two different 5&#x02032;-digoxigenin-LNA/DNA mixmer probes, either fully complementary to wild-type pRNA or to pRNA mut. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> illustrates that, for both pRNA variants, higher detection sensitivity was obtained with the fully complementary probe, although both probes were also able to mutually recognize the corresponding mismatching pRNA variant. Detection sensitivity of the wild-type pRNA probe generally exceeded that of the pRNA mut probe, which is attributed to the different distribution of LNA modifications in the two probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). This illustrates the sensitivity of the method to the design of LNA probes in terms of the number and positioning of LNA residues. Of note, pRNA mut migrated somewhat faster than wild-type pRNA in the native 20% PAA gel, suggesting that its hairpin structure indeed formed during electrophoresis, at least transiently.

We initially designed probe 1 (14 nt) for the detection of <italic>E. coli</italic> pRNAs, but the specific signal was weak, with a strong background of non-specific signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). Since two of the five LNA modifications were in the stretch of four C residues, we were concerned that this may have led to non-specific interactions with complementary tetra-G stretches in other RNA molecules. We then designed probes 2 (14 nt) and 3 (16 nt) with only two LNA residues located outside the tetra-C stretch. This largely improved the sensitivity and specificity of the northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B and C). <italic>E. coli</italic> pRNAs were only detected under outgrowth conditions in the wild-type strain, but not in the 6S RNA knockout (<italic>&#x00394;ssrS</italic>) strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A&#x02013;C, lanes 4, 10 and 16 versus lanes 6, 12 and 18).

NC filters were stripped after hybridization with pRNA probes and hybridized with a 5S rRNA-specific probe (as loading control) shown at the bottom of each panel.

After blotting to a nylone membrane, the blot was cut into the two halves with identical sample sets and hybridized either to the <italic>E. coli</italic> pRNA probe 3 or to a digoxigenin-labeled 6S RNA antisense transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D and E). This experiment revealed (i) that the aforementioned band is indeed a 6S RNA:pRNA hybrid, as the signal was detected with both probes (arrows in panels D and E), (ii) that 6S RNA is present in the <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 wild-type, but not in &#x00394;<italic>ssrS</italic> derivative strain, also verifying that signals marked with asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A&#x02013;D are not related to 6S RNA, thus representing a cross-hybridizing RNA of unknown identity.

Shortening of this heating step to 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D, lanes 2 and 3) was insufficient to dissolve the RNA multimers.

This technique is novel in that it combines three elements: (i) 5&#x02032;-digoxigenin-endlabeled LNA/DNA mixmer probes, (ii) EDC crosslinking of RNAs to nylon membranes, and (iii) native PAGE systems. The method was successfully applied to the detection of &#x02018;tiny&#x02019; pRNAs from two different model systems, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, which leads us to conclude that the procedure will be broadly applicable. Parallel analysis of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> 6S RNA knockout strains unequivocally confirmed specific detection of endogenous pRNAs.</p><p>Our detection of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 6S-1 RNA with the pRNA-specific LNA/DNA mixmer probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lanes 4 and 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), attributed to formation of seven consecutive base pairs (to 151&#x02013;157 nt of 6S-1 RNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), suggested that even RNAs smaller than 14 nt will be detectable by the approach. Detection of natural RNA oligonucleotides &#x0003c;10 nt may be interesting for the method&#x02019;s application to the detection of eukaryotic small RNAs, e.g. of RNA 9-mers derived from Ago2 cleavage of siRNA passenger strands. For shorter target RNA interactions, LNA probes with an increased proportion of LNA residues (possibly combined with 2&#x02032;-OCH<sub>3</sub> instead of DNA residues), or even all-LNA variants, possibly with a single 5&#x02032;-terminal non-LNA residue carrying the 5&#x02032;-digoxigenin label, may preserve high detection sensitivity for target RNA oligonucleotides as short as 8-mers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). 8- to 9-meric LNA probes have indeed been shown to form stable duplexes with their target [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>); for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>)]. Thus, even the aforementioned RNA 9-mers derived from Ago2 cleavage of siRNA passenger strands in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) should be detectable with our northern blot protocol, a prediction we are currently testing. Another application may be detection of short abortive transcripts (2&#x02013;15 nt) synthesized by bacterial and eukaryotic RNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, successful application of such very short all-LNA probes in northern blot experiments will depend on how specific signals can be distinguished or separated from non-specific interactions. 5&#x02032;-digoxigenin LNA probes may also be replaced with 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled LNA probes, as efficient 5&#x02032;-end labeling of LNA oligonucleotides by T4 polynucleotide kinase has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>As expected, RNA oligonucleotides carrying a 5&#x02032;-phosphate are efficient substrates for EDC crosslinking to nylon membranes. Nevertheless, RNA variants with a 5&#x02032;-hydroxyl group can be crosslinked as well, although with substantially reduced efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), indicating that internal phosphodiesters are also substrates for EDC crosslinking. Thus, in the case of detection of small RNAs with 5&#x02032;-OH groups derived from upstream cleavage events, a 5&#x02032;-phosphorylation step before electrophoresis and membrane transfer should be included to enhance detection sensitivity.</p><p>Our results with the chemically synthesized <italic>B. subtili</italic>s pRNA and its mutant derivative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) illustrated that intramolecular secondary structures of RNA oligonucleotides appear to have little effect on detection sensitivity. Also, one should take into account that extent and stability of intramolecular structure formation are limited for a 14-mer owing to its limited sequence space. The experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> provided evidence that the number and positioning of LNA residues in LNA/DNA mixmer probes affects detection sensitivity. The detection of pRNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic> then substantiated this observation, demonstrating that the number and positioning of LNA residues profoundly affects sensitivity as well as specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Researchers are advised to restrict the number of LNA residues, for example by incorporating only 2 LNA residues at separate positions into a 14-nt long LNA/DNA mixmer. Formation of oligonucleotide dimers is another issue, but here the routinely conducted heating step before gel loading may mitigate this problem in many cases. Nonetheless, as shown for the chemically synthesized <italic>E. coli</italic> pRNA 14-mer, RNA multimerization can be a problem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>D, lanes 2 and 3). We solved this problem by adding denaturing instead of native loading buffer to the RNA gel samples and by extending the 95&#x000b0;C heating step to 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C, lanes 13 and 14).</p><p>Our protocol utilizes non-denaturing electrophoresis conditions. Apparently, denaturing reagents, such as formaldehyde or chaotropic compounds like urea and guanidine hydrochloride, interfere with EDC chemistry involving derivation of amino groups. Since short target RNA oligonucleotides, such as 6S RNA-derived pRNAs, can be released from complexes with complementary RNAs by a heating step, and after release do not form complex intramolecular structures that may lead to aberrant gel migration, the non-denaturing conditions used in our protocol do not entail any significant disadvantage relative to denaturing gel systems. Though we have not observed <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 6S-1 RNA:pRNA hybrids with our native PAGE-based procedure, this was clearly different for the <italic>E. coli</italic> system. Here, a fraction of endogenous 6S RNA:pRNA hybrids survived the hot phenol RNA extraction as well as the heating step (5 min at 95&#x000b0;C) in denaturing loading buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B and C). This extraordinary stability of <italic>E. coli</italic> 6S RNA:pRNA hybrids, even under denaturing conditions, has also been observed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Detection of 6S RNA:pRNA complexes with native PAGE also illustrates a potential advantage of native versus denaturing gel systems, i.e. the increased likelihood to identify biologically relevant RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions under non-denaturing conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (HA 1672/16-1, GK 1384).
