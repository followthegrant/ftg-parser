Wide ranges of microorganisms from different sources are transferred onto meat surfaces that are rich in nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Hide, hair, and hooves of the animals are some of the most widespread sources of bacterial contamination of animals&#x02019; carcass surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p><p>Meat can harbour a large number of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms during primary and further processing. The number of microorganisms on fresh meat surfaces changes during chill storage following a typical microbial growth pattern. Counts of bacteria in meat are in the range 10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>5</sup> cfu/cm<sup>2</sup>, but only around 10% are able to initiate growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The initial lag phase is attributed to microbial adaptation to changing conditions (chill temperatures and surface desiccation). Ensuing logarithmic growth takes place after cells have accommodated to the new environmental setting and adapted their metabolism. When numbers exceed l0<sup>7</sup> cells per cm<sup>2</sup>, the first spoilage signs are detected, as off-odours. Another typical spoilage sign, bacterial slime, is noticeable with cell density around l0<sup>8</sup> cells per cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli </italic>O157:H7 and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> are some of the most frequent pathogens that contaminate meat. <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 contaminate meat by contact with sewage, or contaminated skin and equipment during slaughtering. <italic>S. aureus</italic> can also be transferred to the surface of carcass from various sources such as skin of cattle, hide, equipment and infected personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p>The involvement of <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 foodborne illnesses and <italic>S. aureus</italic> food poisoning outbreaks has been associated with the consumption of meat and meat products, especially undercooked ground beef [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Meat pathogens can cause self-limiting human enteric diseases or systemic and fatal infections of the immunocompromised, the elderly, and the young [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].</p><p><italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 is a Gram negative, facultative anaerobe, non-sporeforming rod shape bacterium. Diseases caused by <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 vary from non-bloody diarrhea and bloody diarrhea through haemorrhagic colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. <italic>S. aureus</italic> is a facultative anaerobe, non-motile, spherical, Gram-positive bacterium. Nausea, vomiting, retching, abdominal cramping, and prostration are the most common symptoms of <italic>S. aureus</italic> food poisoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p>With respect to health and economic problems caused by these bacteria, it is very important to reduce the initial microbial population on meat. Various intervention strategies have been developed to reduce the level of bacteria on surface of animals&#x02019; carcass such as washing and sanitizing with hot water, chlorinated water, food grade acids and salts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"> 9</xref>].</p><p>Organic acids are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) antimicrobial agents, and the dilute solutions of organic acids (1-3%) are generally without effect on desirable sensory properties of meat when used as a carcass decontaminant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"> 10</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies focused on limited treatments for controlling bacteria in which results were inconsistent because of the extensive variations in conditions of experiments. Therefore, this study attempted to compare the antibacterial effect of large number of different treatments, three concentrations of four most frequently used organic acids in previous studies as acetic, lactic, propionic and formic acids, on some important species of bacteria on meat. The objective of this research was to study and compare the antibacterial effect of the studied acids at three concentrations (1, 1.5 and 2%) on the inoculated bacteria, <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, on meat at 4&#x000b1;1&#x000ba;C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY</title><sec><title>Organic Acids</title><p>Three concentrations (1, 1.5 and 2%) of four types of food grade organic acids namely Acetic Acid (100%) (AA), L-Lactic Acid (90%) (LA), Propionic Acid (99%) (PA) and Formic Acid (90%) (FA) (Merck, Germany) were prepared by diluting of glacial form of the acids in sterile distilled water (DW).</p></sec><sec><title>Meat Preparation</title><p>Fresh meat was obtained from a local butchery in Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia. Having been packed in sterile bags, the meat was transported to laboratory in a cool box. The samples were prepared immediately after transferring meat to laboratory. Several 10-gram pieces of meats were procured from freshly slaughtered cow.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial Strains</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 ATCC 888402 and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 29247 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SAMPLE PREPARATION</title><p>Each species of bacteria was cultured on standard plate count agar (Merck, Germany) and was then incubated for 24 hours at 37&#x000ba;C. After 24 hours of incubation, a number of colonies were inoculated in sterile DW, and the cell concentration was adjusted to about 10<sup>3</sup> bacteria/ml.</p><p>The prepared 10-gram pieces of meat were decontaminated by washing with hot sterile DW (80&#x000ba;C) for 30 seconds, then they were kept for few minutes to reach room temperature. At this stage, about 10<sup>3</sup> bacteria/ml of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and <italic>S. aureus</italic> were inoculated individually on decontaminated meat by pouring and swabbing over the meats surfaces. Subsequently, the inoculated meats with selected bacteria were kept for 20 minutes to allow attachment and absorption of bacteria however; some of the inoculated meats were kept as an inoculation control.</p><p>After 20 minutes, the inoculated meat was spray washed with organic acids for 15 seconds individually. Once the inoculated meat was spray washed and drained, they were packed in sterile bags that were stored at 4&#x000b1;1&#x000ba;C. Another set was also prepared at the same time as a replicate.</p><p>Microbiological analyses were carried out immediately after spray washing until the 12<sup>th</sup> day of refrigeration. The surface pH of samples was measured by using flat probe pH meter (Prescisa, Switzerland) on 0, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> days of storage. At this step, each piece of meat (10 g) was aseptically blended with 90 ml of sterile peptone water (Merck, Germany) in a laboratory blender. After that, 1 ml of the blended sample of each inoculated meat with <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and <italic>S. aureus</italic> was transferred onto Petri dishes for pour plate culturing with standard plate count agar (Merck, Germany) individually. Again, another one ml of the same suspension was cultured as a duplicate. The Petri dishes were then incubated for 24 hours at 37&#x000ba;C. After 24 hours of incubation, the number of colonies was enumerated in each Petri dish.</p><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The bacterial population (CFU gr<sup>-1</sup>) was obtained from four replications performed on separate days and their means were converted to log<sub>10</sub> CFU gr<sup>-1</sup>. Differences between log<sub>10</sub> CFU gr<sup>-1</sup> of untreated beef carcass tissue and log<sub>10</sub> CFU gr<sup>-1</sup> of treated beef carcass tissue were calculated as log reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"> 12</xref>]. Log reductions of treatments were compared by Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test using the general linear models of SPSS 12.0 for windows, P value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The total plate count of treated samples showed that all treatments had lethal effect on both pathogenic bacteria.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for log reduction of <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 and <italic>S. aureus</italic> showed that there was significant difference (P&#x0003c;0.05) between 1, 1.5 and 2% concentrations of each organic acid.

Three-way interaction analysis showed that these treatments had different log reductions levels on different days. FA at 1, 1.5 and 2% concentrations reached to 3.16 log<sub>10 </sub>cfu/gr on 8<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> days of storage respectively.</p><p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of log reductions of both bacteria indicated that there is a significant difference (P &#x0003c; 0.05) between log reductions of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and that of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7. A comparison between the log reductions of <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 and <italic>S. aureus</italic> after being exposed to various treatments was shown in Fig. (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>). The mean log reductions of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 showed that <italic>S. aureus</italic> was more sensitive to organic acids than <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The main goal of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of various organic acids applied as spray wash treatment and explore their effect on decreasing the microbial loads of bacteria efficiently on beef tissue. PH is one of the important factors, which influences the growth of bacteria. It has been well established that most microorganisms grow best at pH values around 7.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], therefore, pH reduction is one of the inhibitor factors, which can limit the growth of bacteria. It was indicated that direct bactericidal action of organic acids results from pH decrease within bacterial cell and it was also observed that pH of fish meal decreased directly after acid addition which resulted in reduction of <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Moreover, another study found that the bacteriostatic effect of propionate against <italic>E. coli</italic> was proportional to pH decrease in culture medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p>To date, organic acids have been found as safe antibacterial agents. Various researchers have proved the antibacterial effect of organic acids on different types of pathogenic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"> 15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"> 16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the population of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and <italic>S. aureus</italic> decreased after being exposed to all treatments. The reduction rate of the selected bacteria was proportional to the type and the concentration of each organic acid. Log reductions analysis showed that increase in the concentration of organic acids resulted in increasing the antibacterial effect of organic acids. These findings are similar to that of another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] that scrutinized the reduction in the microbial population of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> when exposed to 1, 2 and 3% concentrations of lactic acid. They found that population reduction of <italic>E. coli</italic> rose by increasing concentration of lactic acid.</p><p>The antibacterial effect of the organic acids was found to be caused mainly by the undissociated form of organic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Non-dissociated organic acids can passively diffuse through a bacterium&#x02019;s cell wall and once internalized into the neutral pH of the cell cytoplasm, they dissociate into anions and protons, both of which exert an inhibitory effect on bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Releasing proton ions causes the internal pH to decrease leading to disruption of proton motive force, and inhibiting substrate transport mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"> 21</xref>].</p><p>The findings of the current study showed that FA treatment was the most effective in reducing the population of selected bacteria. These results were in agreement with that of another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] which indicated that formic acid showed stronger lethal effect on <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> than propionic and acetic acids. The strong antibacterial effect of formic acid is related to its structure. Formic acid is an organic acid with shortest chain, which could be beneficial for its diffusion into the cell and cause acidification of the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p>In addition, analysis of log reductions of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and <italic>S. aureus </italic>showed that the effect of organic acids was more pronounced in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which is a Gram-positive bacterium, than in <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7, which is a Gram-negative bacterium. It was reported that the population of <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> decreased more than <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella sp</italic>., in cultures exposed to treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. The higher sensitivity of gram-positive bacteria to different kinds of antibacterial agents can be related to the structure of the cell wall of this group. Gram-positive bacteria do not possess an outer membrane, hence preservatives can easily enter these cells and their intrinsic resistance is relatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Taken together the population of <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and <italic>S. aureus</italic> decreased after being exposed to AA, LA, PA and FA treatments. Among the treatments, FA showed the best antibacterial effect on both bacteria. In addition, these results indicated that <italic>S. aureus</italic> was more sensitive to organic acids than <italic>E. coli </italic>O157:H7. Collectively, formic acid treatment is a feasible and economical method of decontaminating meat.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation
