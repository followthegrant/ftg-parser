Hence, metrics to assess motor task performance are critical in numerous fields, including neuropathology and neurological recovery, surgical training and certification, and athletic performance (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>). In the vast majority of fields, however, current metrics are human-administered and subjective and require significant personnel resources and time. Thus, there is a critical need for more automated, analytical, and objective evaluation methods (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). From a neuroscience perspective, bimanual task assessment provides insights into motor skill expertise, motor dysfunctions, interconnectivity between brain regions, and higher cognitive and executive functions, such as motor perception, motor action, and task multitasking (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Therefore, incorporating the underlying neurological responses in bimanual motor skill assessment is a logical step toward providing robust, objective metrics, which ultimately may lead to greatly improving our understanding of motor skill processes and facilitating bimanual-based task certification.</p><p>Among all noninvasive functional brain imaging techniques, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offers the unique ability to monitor and quantify fast functional brain activations over numerous cortical areas without constraining and interfering with bimanual task execution. Hence, fNIRS is a promising neuroimaging modality to study cortical brain activations, but to date, only a very limited number of studies have been reported with regard to assessing fine surgical motor skills (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>). These exploratory studies have reported differentiation in functional cortical activations between groups with varying surgical motor skills (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>). However, they suffer from recognized limitations (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>), such as the lack of signal specificity between scalp and cortical hemodynamics (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>), the lack of multivariate statistical approaches that leverage changes in functional brain activity across multiple brain regions, and benchmarking against established metrics. Hence, they have not affected current practice of professional bimanual skill proficiency assessment. Here, we present an fNIRS-based optical neuroimaging methodology that overcomes all these shortcomings at once. We measure concurrently functional activations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the primary motor cortex (M1), and the supplementary motor area (SMA) to map the distributed brain functions associated with motor task strategy, motor task planning, and fine motor control in complex bimanual tasks (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). Moreover, we increase the specificity of optical measurements to cortical tissue hemodynamics by regressing signals from scalp tissues (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>). Furthermore, we leverage changes in intraregional activation and interregional coupling of cerebral regions via multivariate statistical approaches to classify subjects according to motor skill levels. Finally, we compare our fNIRS-based approach with currently used metrics in surgical certification by assessing bimanual motor tasks that are a part of surgical training accreditation.</p><p>The performance of the reported optical neuroimaging methodology enables the objective assessment of complex bimanual motor skills as seen in laparoscopic surgery. Imaging-distributed task-based functional responses demonstrated significant cortical activation differences between subjects with varying surgical expertise. By leveraging connected cerebral regions correlated to fine motor skills, we report increased specificity in discriminating surgical motor skills via fNIRS-based metrics. We show that our approach is significantly more accurate than currently established metrics used for certification in general surgery, as reported via estimated misclassification errors (MCEs). These results demonstrate that the combination of advanced fNIRS imaging with multivariate statistical approaches offers a practical and quantitative method to assess complex bimanual tasks. Topically, the reported optical neuroimaging methodology is well suited to provide quantitative and standardized metrics for bimanual skill&#x02013;based professional certifications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Surgical training task performance assessment</title><p>To demonstrate the potential of neuroimaging as an objective tool to assess bimanual task expertise, we selected a challenging bimanual pattern cutting (PC) task, which is part of the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) programs. The American Board of Surgery now requires demonstrating proficiency in the FLS for certification in general surgery. For our study, we recruited a population with varying laparoscopic surgical expertise as defined via the FLS program and conventional professional nomenclature. The subjects were either classified into established skill levels, such as Novice surgeons (1st- to 3rd-year surgical residents) and Expert surgeons (4th- to 5th-year residents and attending surgeons), or into trained medical students that are labeled as Skilled or Unskilled trainees (see table S1). The Control group constituted medical students that underwent no training at all. Note that all groups were independent, that is, each subject belonged to only one group. Each subject followed the official FLS PC task protocols. The experimental protocol followed by each cohort is provided in fig. S1. We recorded the FLS performance scores for all subjects and the cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) computed for the population following a training protocol. It is important to note that this study is the first to acquire FLS performance scores simultaneously with the neuroimaging data. We obtained the FLS scoring methodology with consent under a nondisclosure agreement from the FLS Committee. Thus, this study is the first one to report on direct comparisons of neuroimaging metrics and FLS scores for validation. In all cases, we acquired the FLS performance score simultaneously with the neuroimaging data.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> shows a schematic of the surgical trainer along with the fNIRS setup that is used to measure real-time cortical activation, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> shows the probe placement schematic designed for this study for PFC, M1, and SMA measurements.

To provide insight at the subject level, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> summarizes the CUSUM scores for each of the subjects with respect to trials performed. Trials that have a FLS performance score higher than 63 are considered a &#x0201c;success,&#x0201d; and the respective CUSUM score is subtracted by 0.07 (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>). Trials that have a performance score lower than 63 are considered a &#x0201c;failure,&#x0201d; and the CUSUM score is added by 0.93 (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>).

To quantify the performance accuracy of neuroimaging-based classification of individuals in preset categories such as Novice surgeons and Expert surgeons, we postcomputed MCEs associated with current accredited FLS performance scores and with our neuroimaging method.</p><p>We used a multivariate statistical method, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), to estimate the MCEs associated with the FLS- and fNIRS-based measurements. We also used quadratic support vector machines (SVMs) to classify subject populations to ensure that classification results are not dependent on classification techniques. MCEs are defined as the probability that the first population is classified into the second population (MCE<sub>12</sub>), and the second population is classified into the first population (MCE<sub>21</sub>). Perfect classification is indicated by MCE = 0%, and complete misclassification is indicated by MCE = 100%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> reports on these two MCEs for FLS performance scores and all combinations of fNIRS metrics for the classification of surgical Experts and Novices. Results indicate that subject classification is relatively poor when considering FLS performance scores only (MCE<sub>12</sub> = 61% and MCE<sub>21</sub> = 53%). On the other hand, neuroimaging-based quantities provide lower errors (besides SMA only). Specifically, the combination of PFC, LMM1, and SMA leads to the overall lowest MCEs (MCE<sub>12</sub> = 4.4% and MCE<sub>21</sub> = 4.2%). In addition, we provide the leave-one-out cross-validation results for the LDA classification models used for this dataset, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>. This approach assesses the robustness of the LDA classification model, where each sample is systematically not used to build the LDA model and is treated independently. Results show that the combination of PFC, LMM1, and SMA leads to the most robust and best performing datasets to build the classification model, as demonstrated by the fact that 100% of the samples in the leave-one-out cross-validation have MCEs &#x0003c; 5%. The specific distributions of the classification results are shown in fig. S8 (A and B). Furthermore, we determined weights for each cortical region and their respective contribution to the total LDA model to show the correlation between different cortical regions on motor skill proficiency. The weights for left lateral PFC (0.58), medial PFC (0.23), right lateral PFC (0.29), LMM1 (&#x02212;0.70), and SMA (0.14) contribute to the entire discriminant function, with the norm of all the weights equal to 1.0. Three regions (left lateral PFC, right lateral PFC, and LMM1) account for 96.18% of the discriminant function, indicating the preponderance of these regions for a robust and accurate subject classification.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Optical neuroimaging assessment of surgical skill level during training</title><p>Beyond determining skill levels of individuals compared to established groups, one key challenge in bimanual skill assessment and in laparoscopic surgery is the evaluation of bimanual motor skill acquisition during training. We applied our neuroimaging methodology to the FLS PC task over an 11-day training period for inexperienced medical students. On the basis of the established FLS metrics currently used in the field, we divided the enrolled medical student population into Skilled and Unskilled trainees at the completion of the training program, as previously shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>.

Results indicate that there are no significant differences between the Control and all training students (Skilled and Unskilled trainees) at the onset of the training program (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).

Furthermore, trained FLS students have significantly higher LMM1 and SMA activation than untrained Control students during the posttest (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). These results reinforce the findings of the previous section regarding functional activation differences between Expert and Novice surgeons.

However, after day 7, the Skilled trainee population demonstrated a significantly different neuroimaging distributed response compared to the first day of training, as demonstrated by very low intragroup MCEs. Conversely, the Unskilled trainee population did not exhibit these marked trends.

While the Unskilled and Skilled trainee intergroups were successfully classified at the end of the training session compared to the pretest, the two populations did exhibit some intragroup overlap in their associated probability density function during the posttest. Of importance, both trainee populations did not exhibit marked differences between the final training day and posttest measurements, as indicated by relatively high MCEs. Classification of Skilled trainees and Control subjects during the posttest also yielded very low MCEs, whereas classification of Unskilled trainees and Control subjects still yielded high MCEs, as shown in further detail in fig.

These cross-validated classification methods show that cortical activation has significantly changed for Skilled trainees during the posttest when compared to Skilled trainees on the pretest or untrained Control subjects, whereas Unskilled trainees do not exhibit such a marked trend.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Classification of subjects with varying surgical expertise levels</title><p>For our neuroimaging-based approach for motor skill differentiation to be formative, it is important to validate the classification models across all subject populations, especially since the studies associated with assessment of established skill levels and FLS training were performed independently in two different institutions. The subject population represents the full spectrum of laparoscopic surgical expertise, from Novices to certified attending surgeons, including Skilled and Unskilled medical student trainees. Regarding the number of procedures and associated level of expertise (at the completion of the training protocol), it is expected that the distribution in terms of surgical skills levels, from more proficient to less proficient, is distributed as follows at the group level: Expert surgeons, Skilled trainees, Unskilled trainees, Novice surgeons, and Control.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> shows the cross-validated classification model results comparing all subject population groups with varying expertise levels.

For example, the first trial in cross-validation results for classifying Expert surgeons from Skilled trainees shows an MCE of 0%, as indicated by a white shade. However, the 29th sample in the classification model, or the third trial in the Skilled trainee group, shows an MCE of 89% when removed from the classification model.

Results indicate that Expert surgeons can be robustly classified with all subject populations, except for Skilled trainees where only 28 of 35 samples have MCEs less than 5%. Similarly, Skilled trainees can be successfully classified with Unskilled trainees, Novice surgeons, and Control subjects. Conversely, Unskilled trainees, Novice surgeons, and Control subjects exhibit a poor intergroup classification as reported by multiple samples leading to high MCEs. Overall, these results indicate that the population with high expertise levels (Expert surgeons and Skilled trainees) can be robustly classified compared to groups that have not yet attained the required expertise levels as required by the FLS training program. &#x0201c;Noncertified&#x0201d; group, including Novice surgeons, Unskilled trainees, and Control subjects, however, cannot be robustly classified among themselves.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" disp-level="1"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>While there have been extensive efforts in the surgical community to confirm training effectiveness and validation of the FLS program (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>), the surgical skill scoring component has received little attention and has garnered criticisms, such as subjectivity in scoring, inconsistencies in FLS score interpretations, and no correlation of patient injury reduction due to FLS certification (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><italic>28</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>). Despite the lack of rigorous evaluation of the FLS scoring methodology, the program has become the de facto evaluation method for accreditation of skills required for general surgery (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). Given the high-stakes nature of surgical assessment in the FLS program and its implications on training for future surgeons, there is a current gap in the rigorous validation of FLS scores as a robust and objective methodology (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). In this regard, previous studies have broached the concept of noninvasive brain imaging as a means for objectively assessing surgical skills (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>). However, they suffer from methodological limitations that are now well recognized by the fNIRS community, namely, the contamination of superficial tissue, such as scalp, dura, or pia matter, in the recorded measurements (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>). To highlight this point, results from the Expert and Novice surgeon cohort in this study were reprocessed without the regression of superficial tissue data and are provided in fig. S9 (A to C). These results demonstrate that previously reported fNIRS-based metrics with the inclusion of superficial tissue responses can statistically differentiate surgical novices and experts (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>) yet fail to classify subjects on the basis of motor skill proficiency and perform as poorly as current surgical skill assessment metrics. In contrast, regressing shallow tissue hemodynamics from the optical measurements significantly reduces the false omission rate, where a surgical novice is mistakenly classified as an expert, to 0%, whereas previous approaches still maintain false omission rates of 13 to 18% (see table S4). While oxygenated hemoglobin is the primary metric used in this study due to superior contrast-to-noise ratios (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>), alternative metrics, such as deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), tissue oxygenation saturation (StO<sub>2</sub>), or total hemoglobin (HbT), may provide further insights into optimal measurement sensitivity and surgical skill assessment.</p><p>Beyond improving the robustness of optical measurements&#x02019; sensitivity to cortical activations, this work is also the first to measure functional activation in a multivariate fashion to determine critical cortical regions that are correlated to surgical motor skill differentiation and classification. More specifically, this is the first report of measuring functional activations in the PFC, M1, and SMA cortical regions that are putatively associated with motor task strategy, motor task planning, and fine motor control (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>). Since the PFC is associated with decision-making and motor strategy development (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>), it is expected that PFC activation decreases as motor skill proficiency increases, as seen in surgical experts. Similarly, higher executive functions such as fine motor skill control are also correlated to increased activation in the M1 and SMA, as expected for surgical experts. Our results corroborate these findings regarding activation changes in the PFC, M1, and SMA as motor skill proficiency increases (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>). Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the inclusion of these cortical regions significantly improves the utility of fNIRS in assessing bimanual skills and can offer improved objective metrics over conventional FLS-based metrics currently used for certification in general surgery. Of importance, while using single regional readouts leads to enhanced population differentiation, the combination of the three abovementioned cortical regions provides excellent classification performances (for completeness, we also provide bivariate classification results using SVMs in figs. S4 to S7). When combining measurements from these three brain regions, optical neuroimaging enables a remarkably robust classification of subjects based on their proven surgical skills levels, including novice, intermediate, and expert skill levels. More precisely, our methodology allows for (i) highly accurate classification of subjects with well-defined bimanual skills levels with better performance than currently used metrics, (ii) longitudinally assessing the acquisition of surgical skills during the FLS training program, and (iii) performing robust classifications of populations recruited from multiple institutions with varying skill levels.</p><p>On a practical side, it is important to note that even if our methods leverage the most recent technical developments in the field of fNIRS, the instrumental and algorithmic platforms used herein are readily available for wide dissemination and use in surgical training facilities. Moreover, as more neuroscience-driven investigations focus on mapping distributed brain function, the positioning of the optodes (source or detector) on the subject scalp becomes increasingly challenging with extended spatial coverage. One key consideration is to ensure that effective coupling is minimally affected by natural movements and not compromised by the subject&#x02019;s hair. Hence, positioning of the optodes can be a lengthy process that is not suitable for professional environments that are time-constrained either by cost or throughput considerations. In this regard, our study identifies that the PFC, SMA, and LMM1 regions are sufficient for accurately assessing bimanual skill&#x02013;based task execution. Thus, probe placement can be completed in a short amount of time without any impact on task execution, both critical factors for the acceptance of our surgical skill assessment methodology by the surgical community.</p><p>Beyond bimanual skill assessment and objective classification of individuals based on their skill levels, the work herein provides a sound foundation to further investigate the neurophysiology underlying bimanual skill acquisition and retention. Here, we deliberately focused on reading the brain outputs as a means to provide objective and quantitative measures of bimanual task execution without delving into the mechanistic understanding of the underlying physiology and functional connectivity. However, current neurophysiological knowledge supports the overall findings of our studies, namely, increases in LMM1 and SMA activation and significant decreases in PFC activation across all groups with increasing motor task performance (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>). It is also important to note that previous studies use motor tasks that are deliberately designed to decrease variability in studying cortical activation changes, such as finger tapping or simple visual or virtual-based unimanual tasks. Conversely, the FLS task at hand is a complex bimanual task that involves visuospatial coordination, varying degrees of synchronicity among hands, motion frequency and range, and exerted forces on the surgical tools for task completion. Consequently, it is not feasible to ensure that each session replicates the same conditions, and hence, the same cortical responses. Moreover, the cortical activations and interactions associated with task planning and execution are dynamic by nature, from expected explicit control in the early stages of learning to more implicit or automatic control in the later stages of motor learning. Thus, mapping the cortical networks and their dynamical changes associated with task execution and skill acquisition should be the next step.</p><p>There is currently great interest in investigating dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) in neuroscience. Typically, DFC studies are conducted using functional magnetic resonance imaging, which is not appropriate for protocols requiring supine positions and/or nonelicited task execution. Recent studies have demonstrated that fNIRS is well positioned in these scenarios (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr"><italic>45</italic></xref>). We foresee that implementing these approaches in the context of bimanual skill assessment can lead to refined skill level assessment metrics and potentially provide predictive models of skill acquisition. For instance, composite cognitive metrics, possibly obtained by weighting regional cortical measurements using the LDA weights for best classification between Skilled and Unskilled trainees, could be central to developing a tailored surgical training program for optimal skill acquisition and retention assessment (figs. S6 and S7). In particular, this approach may be expanded to robustly identify and predict surgical candidates that may achieve faster learning curves for learning complex surgical skills, and by extension, achieve surgical skill mastery with a significantly faster rate than other surgical trainees. Furthermore, these methodologies can be easily applied to other fields, including rehabilitation, brain computer interfaces, robotics, stroke, and rehabilitation therapy (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr"><italic>46</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr"><italic>48</italic></xref>). In summary, we believe that this noninvasive imaging approach for objective quantification for complex bimanual motor skills will bring about a paradigm change in broad applications, such as surgical certification and assessment, aviation training, and motor skill rehabilitation and therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Massachusetts General Hospital, University of Buffalo, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Hardware and equipment</title><p>We used a validated continuous-wave, 32-channel, near- infrared spectrometer for this study, which delivered infrared light at 690 and 830 nm (CW6 system, TechEn Inc.). The system used eight long-distance and eight short-distance illumination fibers coupled to 16 detectors. The long-distance channels comprised all the measurements within a 30- to 40-mm distance between the source and the detector, and the short distance channels comprised all the measurements within a ~8-mm distance between the source and the detector. The short channels were limited to probing the superficial tissue layers, such as skin, bone, dura, and pial surfaces, whereas the long channel probed both superficial layers and cortical surface. The probe design was assessed using Monte Carlo simulations and was characterized to have high sensitivity to functional changes in the PFC, M1, and SMA. A schematic of the geometric arrangement of probes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Participants and experimental design</title><p>Seventeen surgeons and 13 medical students participated in this study.

On the basis of an initial pilot study, a conservative effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 1.4) was chosen for the prefrontal and motor cortices. Furthermore, with a 95% confidence interval and a minimum power of 0.80, it was determined that a minimum of eight samples were required per group, which was calculated by a statistical software, G*Power (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr"><italic>49</italic></xref>). The sample population was distributed within Novices (<italic>n</italic> = 9, 1st- to 3rd-year residents with mean age 31 &#x000b1; 2) and Experts (<italic>n</italic> = 8, 4th- and 5th-year residents and attending surgeons with mean age 35 &#x000b1; 6) surgeons. Subject demographics are listed in table S1. We ad hoc defined surgical novices and experts on the basis of the number of laparoscopic procedures completed according to the literature (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr"><italic>50</italic></xref>). To avoid any issues regarding hemisphere-specific activation, only right-handed participants were selected. All participants were instructed on how to perform the task with standardized verbal instructions indicating the goal of the task and rules for task completion. The optical probes were positioned on the participant with great care to avoid any hair between the source/detector and scalp, as well as robust coupling with the skin. The cap holding the fibers on the participant as well as the fibers did not hinder the participant&#x02019;s movement during bimanual tasks. This cap is a standard electroencephalography EASYCAP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.easycap.de">www.easycap.de</ext-link>) that has been used for numerous fNIRS studies (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr"><italic>51</italic></xref>), which has marked anatomical landmarks for placement on the scalp. The cap was carefully placed on the scalp by aligning the CZ, FP1, and FP2 landmarks on the head and the marked landmarks on the cap. Specific anatomical location simulations (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr"><italic>52</italic></xref>) for each source and detector channel are shown in table S2. The participants were asked to perform the FLS PC task using an FLS-certified simulator, where the goal was to use laparoscopic tools to cut a marked piece of gauze as quickly and as accurately as possible. The experiment for each participant consisted of a block design of rest and stimulus period (cutting task). The surgical cutting task was performed until completion or stopped after 5 min. Then, a rest period of 1 min was observed. The cycle of cutting task and rest periods was repeated five times per participant. The following measurements were recorded simultaneously for each participant during each trial: total task time, light intensity (raw NIRS data), and performance scores for the PC task were based on the FLS metrics.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>NIRS after processing</title><p>Data processing was completed using the open-source software HOMER2 (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr"><italic>53</italic></xref>), which is implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks). First, channels with signal quality outside of the range of 80 to 140 dB were excluded. The remaining raw optical signals (intensity at 690 and 830 nm) were converted into optical density using the modified Beer-Lambert law with a partial path-length factor of 6.4 (690 nm) and 5.8 (830 nm) (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr"><italic>54</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr"><italic>56</italic></xref>). Motion artifacts and systemic physiology interference were corrected using recursive principal component analysis and low-pass filters (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr"><italic>53</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr"><italic>57</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr"><italic>58</italic></xref>). The filtered optical density data were used to derive the delta concentrations of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin.</p><p>The short-distance channels were regressed from the long-distance channels to remove any interference originating from superficial layers. This was achieved by using a consecutive sequence of Gaussian basis functions via ordinary least squares to regress scalp and dura activation data collected from the short separation fibers to create the hemodynamic response function (HRF) (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr"><italic>59</italic></xref>). The corresponding source and detector pairs for each source were averaged over the task start and end time for each trial and subject (as shown in fig. S1). For example, if a subject performed five trials, then the HRF would be group-averaged over the task stimulus for each trial, ensuring that rest periods were not included in the group average. It is important to note that the task stimulus period for a given trial of each subject may vary because of motor skill proficiency, as seen in varying task completion times (table S3). The result is a scalar value for the change in oxyhemoglobin according to different brain regions for all participants. Finally, scalar values for each of the 32 channels were grouped into eight distinct regions of interest according to the anatomical structures as follows: left PFC (source 1, detectors 1 and 2), medial PFC (source 2, detectors 2 and 3), right PFC (source 3, detectors 3 and 4), left lateral M1 (source 4, detectors 5 to 8), LMM1 (source 5, detectors 8 to 10), right medial M1 (source 6, detectors 9 to 12), right lateral M1 (source 7, detectors 11 to 14), and finally, SMA (source 8, detectors 9, 15, and 16).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Task performance metrics, statistical, and classification methods</title><p>The FLS scores were determined using the standardized FLS scoring metric formulation for the PC task based on time and error.
