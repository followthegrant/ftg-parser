However, integration efficiency is negatively affected by the length of the transposon. To optimize the SB transposon machinery, the inverted repeats and the transposase gene underwent several modifications, resulting in the generation of the hyperactive SB100X transposase and of the high-capacity &#x0201c;sandwich&#x0201d; (SA) transposon. In this study, we report a side-by-side comparison of the SA and the widely used T2 arrangement of transposon vectors carrying increasing DNA cargoes, up to 18 kb. Clonal analysis of SA integrants in human epithelial cells and in immortalized keratinocytes demonstrates stability and integrity of the transposon independently from the cargo size and copy number-dependent expression of the cargo cassette. A genome-wide analysis of unambiguously mapped SA integrations in keratinocytes showed an almost random distribution, with an overrepresentation in repetitive elements (satellite, LINE and small RNAs) compared to a library representing insertions of the first-generation transposon vector and to gammaretroviral and lentiviral libraries. The SA transposon/SB100X integrating system therefore shows important features as a system for delivering large gene constructs for gene therapy applications.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was received for this study from Italian Ministry of University and Research-FIRB 2008 (AR), DEBRA international (AR) and the European Research Council (GT-SKIN) (FM).

Tc1/<italic>mariner</italic> elements are generally 1,300&#x02013;2,400 bp in length and contain a single gene coding for the transposase that is flanked by terminal inverted repeats (IR). The IRs of SB host a pair of binding sites containing short, 15&#x02013;20 bp direct repeats (DRs). Both the outer and the inner pairs of transposase-binding sites are required for transposition. The SB transposase binds the IRs in a sequence-specific manner, and mediates precise cut-and-paste transposition in a wide variety of vertebrate cells including human cells <xref rid="pone.0112712-Mates1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112712-Ivics2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. For this reason, the SB-based integration system is a valuable tool for functional genomics in several model organisms and represents a promising vector for human gene therapy <xref rid="pone.0112712-Hackett1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112712-Ivics3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, a major bottleneck of any transposon-based application is the low transposition efficiency. Therefore, considerable effort was dedicated to improve the SB integration machinery by modifying its IRs and systematically mutating the transposase gene. In 2002, Cui et al. carefully explored the structure and functions of the IRs. They modified the outer and inner DR sites of both IRs and the spacer sequence between the DRs generating a new version of transposon IR, called T2, with fourfold increased transposition efficiency <xref rid="pone.0112712-Cui1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the transpositional activity of this system (and that of the first-generation transposon <xref rid="pone.0112712-Izsvak1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) is negatively affected by the size of transposon, resulting in an exponential drop for every kb introduced between the two IR.</p><p>In 2004, Zayed et al. constructed the &#x0201c;sandwich&#x0201d; (SA) version of the transposon vector <xref rid="pone.0112712-Zayed1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The SA IR consists of two complete transposon elements in a head to head orientation, flanking a DNA expression cassette, thereby forming a sandwich-like arrangement. Mutation of the 5&#x02032; terminal CA nucleotides of the right IR abolishes cleavage at the innermost transposon ends; therefore, only the four terminal DRs represent the catalytic substrate for the &#x0201c;cut and paste&#x0201d; transposition. The SA transposon showed a 3.7-fold enhanced activity over first generation transposon to integrate &#x0223c;7.5 kb-DNA sequence upon SB10 transposase delivery. Five years later, a transposase 100-fold more active than SB10, named SB100X, was developed by a high-throughput, PCR-based DNA shuffling strategy <xref rid="pone.0112712-Mates1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The improved integration efficiency associated with SB transposition opened new avenues for its application. The hyperactive SB100X transposase was employed to obtain highly efficient germline transgenesis in pigs <xref rid="pone.0112712-Ivics4" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112712-Garrels1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> rabbits <xref rid="pone.0112712-Ivics5" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and rodents <xref rid="pone.0112712-Katter1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112712-Ivics6" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, stable transfer of therapeutic genes in clinical relevant cells <xref rid="pone.0112712-Mates1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112712-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112712-Wilber1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and reprogramming of mouse embryonic and human foreskin fibroblasts into iPS cells <xref rid="pone.0112712-Grabundzija1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the integration efficiency of large expression cassettes mediated by the optimized SB elements: the SA transposon and the SB100X transposase. We report a side-by-side comparison between the SA and the T2 transposons carrying DNA cargo of increasing length. We performed a deep molecular characterization of SA-mediated integrants in epithelial cell lines and in primary immortalized keratinocytes stressing the SB system with cargos up to 18 kb. These data provide evidence for stability of SB-mediated integration and the reproducibility of the cut-and-paste mechanism even with large transposons embedded between two double IRs. Moreover, clonal analysis reveals a linear correlation between transposon copies harboured into the genomic DNA and their expression, an important characteristic for gene therapy application. Finally, high-resolution, genome-wide mapping of SA integrations in human keratinocytes revealed a close-to-random integration pattern with respect to genes and chromosomes, highlighting a relative low risk of genotoxicity as previously reported for SB transposition in cell lines <xref rid="pone.0112712-Ammar1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112712-Voigt1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Interestingly, the high-throughput analysis of SA integration sites showed an overrepresentation of integration events into repetitive elements (RE) of the human genome, in particular satellite, small RNA and LINE elements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HeLa cells were cultured using DMEM medium (Lonza) added with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% L-Glutamine (L-Gln) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Pen/Strep).

Nonetheless, T2 and SA constructs carrying cargos of comparable size showed similar transposition efficiency in both cell lines. From these data we can conclude that the T2 IR construct is interchangeable with the SA construct with some advantages: T2 has shorter IRs thereby it could accept a larger cargo cassette.</p><p>Transposed GABEB and HeLa populations were subjected to limiting dilution to obtain a single cell derived expansion. The derived clones were employed to characterize several molecular parameters: transposon-independent insertion, copy number, genomic stability, faithful transposition activity, correlation between copy number and expression of the integrated cassette.

It could be that these genomic regions are favourable for integration due to their base composition (TA-richness) or there might be molecular mechanisms that actively recruit the transposon/transposase complex at specific RE sites <xref rid="pone.0112712-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112712-Masumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p>Curiously, the frequency of RE elements in the first-generation transposon library and its weighted control were comparable. Differently from the SA (obtained in 80% Venus expressing immortalized keratinocytes without selective pressure), the first-generation transposon library derives from transposed HeLa cells <xref rid="pone.0112712-DeLuca1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> selected for two weeks by antibiotic resistance. This culture condition could negatively select those integrations landing into poorly expressed genomic loci or into heterochromatin regions <xref rid="pone.0112712-deJong1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Nevertheless, the first-generation transposon integrations were slightly increased into satellite regions and SINE, whereas LTR and DNA elements were underrepresented compared to the background.</p><p>These data identify some common features in SB datasets. Conversely, MLV and HIV-derived viral vectors disfavour integration in RE (satellite, LTR and LINE accordingly also to <xref rid="pone.0112712-Carteau1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>) suggesting an active role of viral integrase in the selection of integration sites that could better support the expression, replication and survival of the viral progeny.
