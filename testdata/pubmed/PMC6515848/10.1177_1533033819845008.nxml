Discontinuous fractional tumor treating fields of an intensity of 0.9 to 1.2 V/cm and a frequency of 150 KHz were applied to U373 cancer cells and IEC6 normal cells for 3 days, with durations of 3, 6, 12, or 24 h/d. As the treatment duration of the tumor treating fields increased from 3 to 24 h/d, the relative tumor cell (U373) number (% of control) reduced in proportion to the treatment duration. Compared to a 25% cell number reduction (75% of control) for the group of 6 h/d treatment at 1.2 V/cm, only 5% (70% of control) and 8% (67% of control) of additional reductions were observed for the group of 12 and 24 h/d treatment, respectively. This experimental result indicates that the dependence on treatment duration in tumor cell inhibition was weakened distinctly at treatment duration over 6 h/d. For normal cells (IEC6), the relative cell number corresponding to the treatment time of the tumor treating fields at 1.2 V/cm of electric field strength was not decreased much for the treatment times of 3, 6, and 12 h/d, revealing 93.3%, 90.0%, and 89.3% relative cell numbers, respectively, but it suddenly decreased to &#x0223c;73% for the 24 h/d treatment. Our results showed that the effects of tumor treating fields on tumor cells were higher than on normal cells for treatment duration of 3 to 12 h/d, but the difference became minimal for treatment duration of 24 h/d. The fractionated scheme, using tumor treating fields, reduced the treatment time while maintaining efficacy, suggesting that this method may be clinically applicable for cancer treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tumor treating fields</kwd><kwd>fractionated scheme</kwd><kwd>radiotherapy</kwd><kwd>glioblastoma</kwd><kwd>head and neck cancer</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1533033819845008"><title>Introduction</title><p>Some cancers have been shown to be intractable to current treatment options, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive cancer that accounts for more than 60% of all brain tumors in adults.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1533033819845008" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-1533033819845008" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr3-1533033819845008" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The 2018 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy for patients with GBM.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1533033819845008" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-1533033819845008" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr6-1533033819845008" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Despite significant therapeutic improvements from the combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy; however, the median overall survival of patients with GBM is less than 1 year, with most patients dying less than 2 years after diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1533033819845008" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Therefore, it is essential to develop new types of therapies that can effectively prolong patient survival.</p><p>One novel treatment for GBM consists of using alternating electric fields (tumor treating fields [TTFields]), with an intensity of 1 to 3 V/cm and a frequency of 100 to 300 kHz.

In radiotherapy, the total dose of radiation is divided into several, smaller doses over a period of several days to reduce toxic effects on healthy cells. This fractionation scheme can maximize the effect of radiation on cancer with minimized side effects and a typical fractionation scheme divides the dose into 20 to 30 units delivered every weekday over 4 to 6 weeks. In this study, using the concept of fractionation scheme to optimize the radiotherapy, we evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a fractionated scheme in TTFields treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section2-1533033819845008"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="section3-1533033819845008"><title>Experimental Setup for the Treatment With TTFields</title><p>After amplifying the signals by connecting the function generator (AFG-2112, Good Will Instrument Co, Ltd, Xinbei City, Taiwan) and amplifier (A303, A.A.

Although the relative cell numbers of U373 were reduced in proportion to the treatment times under 6 h/d, this dependence on treatment time was weakened significantly at treatment times over 6 h/d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1533033819845008">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, the relative cell number of U373 cells treated for 3 h/d differed by &#x0223c;10% from that of the cells treated for 6 h/d, whereas the relative cell number of the cells treated for 12 h/d differed by only &#x0223c;7% from that of the cells treated for 24 h/d. Moreover, when the total treatment time was kept constant, the relative cell number was independent of the fractionation period. For example, the relative cell numbers of the cells treated for the 20 minutes (scheme 1) and 24 hours (scheme 2 in <xref rid="table1-1533033819845008" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) fractionation periods were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1533033819845008">Figure 2A</xref>).

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1533033819845008">Figure 2C</xref> shows that the relative cell number of the tumor cells treated with the TTFields at a field intensity of 0.9 V/cm was much lower than that of the normal cells for all the fractionation schemes. These findings suggest that the TTFields treatment can effectively suppress cancer cells without significantly damaging normal cells. Moreover, the differences in the effects of the TTFields on the relative cell number of the cancer and normal cells were more pronounced for the treatment times of 3 to 12 h/d, but became minimal for the treatment times of 24 h/d. For example, the difference in the relative cell number between the cancer cells (U373) and the normal cells (IEC6) treated for 12 h/d was 17.8%, but this difference decreased to 6.2% when the TTFields treatment was applied for 24 h/d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1533033819845008">Figure 2C</xref>). These findings indicate that to maximize the damage to the tumor cells while minimizing the damage to the normal cells, the application of the TTFields for 24 h/d should be avoided, and a fractionation scheme should be applied. For example, increasing the field intensity from 0.9 to 1.2 V/cm and decreasing the treatment time from 24 to 12 h/d resulted in the same level of inhibition of the relative tumor cell number (&#x0223c;0.7% difference), while significantly reducing damage to the normal cells (&#x0223c;13.3% difference; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1533033819845008">Figure 2C and D</xref>).</p><p>We also examined whether the TTFields enhanced cytotoxicity, by assessing the activation of the main enzyme involved in cell apoptosis, caspase-3, and by evaluating PARP fragmentation in the normal and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1533033819845008">Figure 3A</xref>). We found that treatment with the fractionated TTFields enhanced of both caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in the cancer and normal cells. Both caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in the tumor cells increased gradually as the treatment time increased from 0 to 24 hours. In the normal cells, however, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage were relatively low at the treatment times of 3 to 12 hours, with abrupt increases at the treatment time of 24 hours. These results were also confirmed by analyzing Annexin V, a protein used for apoptosis cell detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1533033819845008">Figure 3B</xref>). Treatment with the fractionated TTFields also delayed the clearance of &#x003b3;H2AX, suggesting that the TTFields maintained DNA damage, thereby increasing cell sensitivity. Similar results were found in the &#x003b3;H2AX focus analysis as well as by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1533033819845008">Figure 3C and D</xref>). In addition, the abnormally accumulated &#x003b3;H2AX foci are also observed in cytoplasm, and this cytosolic accumulation of &#x003b3;H2AX has been reported to be associated with tropomyosin-related kinase A-induced cell death.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1533033819845008" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> To investigate the cell cycle phases affecting the TTField-induced cell death following fractionation, we examined the cell cycle profiles and the expression of the cell cycle regulators involved in the G2/M transitions after the fractionated TTFields treatment in normal and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1533033819845008">Figure 4</xref>). Although they are not directly proportional, Western blotting results showed a tendency that the longer duration of TTFields treatment per day results in the more accumulation of p-cdc2 and cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1533033819845008">Figure 4A</xref>). For example, relative intensities of cyclin B1 in IEC6 (U373) were 1.00 (1.00), 1.05(1.05), 1.05(1.08), 1.27(1.14), 2.21(1.38) for 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours of treatment per day, respectively. This result suggests that the longer duration of TTFields treatment leads to more cells remaining in the G2/M phase. Flow cytometry was consistent with Western blot data in terms of increased number of cells remaining in the G2/M phase as the duration of TTFields treatments increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1533033819845008">Figure 4B</xref>). However, there was no direct (or linear) proportionality between Western blot data and flow cytometry for the duration of TTFields treatments. For example, although it is proportional, a large increase in the cyclin B levels at 24 hours in the IEC-6 cells was not accompanied by an increase in the fraction of cells in G2/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1533033819845008">Figure 4</xref>).

Therefore, to optimize the treatment results, TTFields on time per day should be applied as long as possible if the strength of electric field is fixed. Current treatment scheme (TTFields on time for 18 h/d, ie, all day long) follows this method since the output voltage (or electric field applied to patient skin) coming from device is fixed. But, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1533033819845008">Figure 2</xref>, the antimitotic effects of TTFields on tumor cells increase rapidly as TTFields on time increases from 0 to 6 h/d, but the slope (or the proportionality) decreases as TTFields on time increases from 6 to 24 h/d. This result suggests that the effects of TTFields are not linearly (or directly) proportional to the duration of treatment per day. Therefore, to optimize the efficacy of TTFields based on our results, one might decrease TTFields on time per day with an increased strength of electric field. Although the reduced duration of TTFields with an increased treatment intensity is a possible way of optimization for TTFields treatment, there is a limitation of this optimization since the increased intensity is associated with the heating problem. In general, the heat generation is dependent on the intensity of treatment field as well as the duration of TTFields on time. Although an increase in intensity will increase the heat under skin, the decrease in duration of TTFields treatment will decrease the heat under skin. Therefore, the optimal treatment scheme with maximum possible intensity of TTFields with reduced TTFields on time per day should be chosen on the condition that this treatment scheme can provide the same biological efficacy of original treatment without heat side effect.</p><p>The experimental results suggest that the effects of TTFields might persist not only during the time of the treatment but also during the intervals between the treatments. In general, the effects of radiation appear several hours (as DNA damage), several days (as DNA mutation and cell death), and even several years (as cancer) after the cessation of the treatment. Our findings suggest that, like conventional radiation, TTFields affect the cells after the cessation of the treatment. Moreover, the TTFields had greater effects on the cancer cells than on the normal cells, suggesting that the TTFields can selectively damage the cancer cells. Although this study tested fractionated therapy in GBM cells only, this investigation should be extended by conducting experiments involving reproductive cell death, and an <italic>in vivo</italic> study using tissue from several cancer types can be targeted to provide a scientific rationale to treat TTFields.</p><p>Our data provide a molecular biological basis by which a fractionated TTFields treatment has therapeutic efficacy against cancer cells. The biomarkers associated with apoptosis, such as cleaved PARP, caspase-3, and Annexin V, were observed in the normal cells that received continuous treatment but were not observed in the fractionated TTFields treatment group. In contrast, the effects of the TTFields on cancer cells were proportional to the treatment time. Thus, the application of a fractionation scheme resulted in a greater degree of apoptosis in the cancer cells than in normal cells. The TTFields therapy seems to induce apoptosis in cancer cells as well as slows cell cycle progression. However, since the effect on cell cycle progression is not dramatic, the mechanism by which TTFields therapy has a relatively selective effect on cancer cells is presumed to be by DNA damage-induced cell death.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1533033819845008" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> A relatively selective effect on cancer cells seems to come from the shorter doubling time of U373 cells (18 hours) compared to that of IEC-6 cells (50 hours) and it is well matched with previous study,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1533033819845008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> which showed that treatment with TTFields have a higher therapeutic effect with shorter cell doubling times. Because this study only assessed one normal and one cancer cell line, there is a need to assess the effects of TTFields in other cell lines, as well as to evaluate the long-term outcomes in cells treated with the TTFields. Moreover, this study was performed in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system, so <italic>in vivo</italic> research using animal models should be performed to investigate the effects of fractionated TTFields prior to clinical trials and to minimize possible complications in clinical applications. Further studies are needed to optimize the field intensity, treatment duration, fractionation period, and frequency for tailored therapy.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that fractionated TTFields treatment is associated with the inhibition of tumor cell survival, DNA double-strand breaks, and the cell cycle in cancer cells, suggesting that fractionated TTFields could be exploited as a novel strategy to treat cancer cells using alternating electric fields. Treatment efficacy may be optimized by shorter treatment times at a higher intensity on the condition that the optimized treatment scheme can provide the same biological efficacy of original (continuous) treatment without heat side effect.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-1533033819845008"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Note:</bold> Our study did not require an ethical board approval because it did not contain human or animal trials</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn2-1533033819845008"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn3-1533033819845008"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the National Nuclear R&#x00026;D Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (NRF-2013M2A2A7067089, NRF-2017R1D1A1B03028923, NRF-2018R1D1A1B07047770) and the Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences (KIRAMS), which was funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning, Republic of Korea (50531-2018).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-1533033819845008"><p><bold>ORCID iD:</bold> Myonggeun Yoon <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1533033819845008-img1.jpg"/>
