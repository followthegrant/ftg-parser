Hyperglycemia has a direct, harmful effect on the cardiovascular system, and requires, at the very least, a link between acute hyperglycemia and 1 or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">2</xref>]. Associated with obesity, there is hyperinsulinemia, high circulating triglyceride and low HDL, and alteration in the sensitivity or reactivity of vascular smooth muscle to neurotransmitters and circulating hormones, which may cause or contribute to diabetic vessel complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">4</xref>]. In diabetes, the plasma cholesterol level is usually elevated and this plays a role in the accelerated development of atherosclerotic vascular disease, which is a major long-term complication of diabetes in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">5</xref>].</p><p>The search for appropriate hypoglycemic agents has recently focused on plants, and many herbal medicines have been recommended for the treatment of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">6</xref>]. Herbal drugs are frequently considered to be less toxic than their synthetic counterparts and they have fewer adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">7</xref>].</p><p><italic>Solanum nigrum</italic>, belonging to the Solanaceae family, is a weed of wastelands, old fields, and ditches. It is an annual branched herb up to 90 cm high, with dull dark green leaves. Its flowers are small and white, with a short pedicellate and 5 widely spread petals, found in most parts of Iran, India, and Southern Europe. Some of the beneficial uses of <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> extract include, its action against microbial infections, cure of skin diseases and as a hypoglycemic and anti-ulcerogenic agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">8</xref>]. The plant is cultivated as a food crop, both for its fruit and its leaves, in some parts of the world and it appears that its toxicity can vary considerably according to where the plant is grown and the cultivar that is being grown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">9</xref>].</p><p>The leaves, stems, and roots are used externally as a poultice in the treatment of cancerous sores, boils, leucoderma, and wounds. Extracts of the plant are analgesic, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory and vasodilator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">9</xref>]. The plant has been used in the manufacture of locally analgesic ointments and the juice of the fruit has been used as an analgesic for toothaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">9</xref>]. Poongothai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">9</xref>] also showed that administration of <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> leaves to alloxan-induced diabetic rats caused significant anti-hyperglycemic and hypolipidemic effects. Some studies have shown that oral administration of ethanolic extract of <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> on blood sugar of albino rat for 5 and 7 days leads to significant decrease in blood sugar compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">10</xref>]. Recent studies have revealed that administration of <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> leaves in normoglycemic and diabetic rats could decrease blood glucose level via increase in insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">12</xref>].

There was no significant difference between the NDC and CD-SNE groups but there was a significant difference between the ND-SNE and NDC and CD-SNE groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was designed to investigate the effect of oral administration of <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> fruit extract on plasma glucose, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, VLDL total cholesterol levels, and the sensitivity of the vascular mesenteric bed to phenylephrine in normal and diabetic rats.</p><p>The results of the present study show that administration of 1 g/l of <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> fruit extract to drinking water of diabetic animals for 8 weeks can decrease blood glucose levels, but the mechanism whereby this is accomplished is not well understood. Poongothai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">9</xref>] showed that administration of <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> leaves decreased blood glucose levels in diabetic rats. IPGTT outcomes from the present study suggest that <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> may repair pancreas beta cells and enhance insulin secretion or increase Glu4 translocation in the cell membrane, which then decreases blood glucose levels. Furthermore, treatment with <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> improves glucose tolerance in diabetic rats, suggesting an enhanced insulin secretion or increase in GLu4 translocation. Blood glucose was unable to reach normal levels in the untreated diabetic rats 2 hours after glucose injection, and the blood glucose in the <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic>-treated diabetic rats returned to normal levels.</p><p>In the present study, plasma magnesium levels increased after <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> administration but did not attain the same levels as in the NDC group. Intracellular magnesium shift may explain this observation, in line with our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">21</xref>]. It is interesting, however, that <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> administration in ND-PSG animals decreased plasma magnesium levels. Our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">21</xref>] have shown magnesium deficiency as a potential factor in the pathogenesis of complications in diabetes, and it appears that human consumption of <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> in food may increase the risk of diabetes induction.</p><p>Our finding shows the Ca/Mg ratio was significantly elevated in untreated diabetic rats, but it decreased in the <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic>-treated group. Ca/Mg ratio is a marker of vascular tone, in which an increase represents increased vascular reactivity and atherogenic risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">22</xref>]. Occurrence of atherogenic lesions is poorly correlated with serum cholesterol level and highly dependent on plasma magnesium level and Ca/Mg ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">22</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> administration can decrease the Ca/Mg ratio and prevent atherosclerosis.</p><p>Our results show that <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> administration can decrease triglycerides, cholesterol, VLDL, and LDL cholesterol, and also increase HDL cholesterol. The decrease in serum triglycerides is associated with the change in total serum Mg concentration. There is increasing evidence for the role of magnesium in the modulation of serum lipids and lipid uptake in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">23</xref>]. Some research results indicate a significant antioxidant and antihyperlipidemic activity of <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> fruits, which protects against ethanol-induced toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">24</xref>].</p><p>Vascular disease is one of the complicating features of diabetes mellitus. Several prospective studies have indicated that hypertension in diabetic patients occurs at twice the rate found in the non-diabetic population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">25</xref>]. Hypertension is also considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">25</xref>]. It has been suggested that alterations in the reactivity of blood vessels to neurotransmitters and circulating hormones are responsible for the cardiovascular complications of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-medscimonitbasicres-19-133">4</xref>]. In our study, response to phenylephrine was considered an alteration in vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictor agents, and alteration in the Ca/Mg ratio was considered a marker for atherosclerosis. Our results show that the administration of <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> for 8 weeks can decrease the alteration in vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictor agents and also decrease vessel atherosclerosis. Although the Ca/Mg ratio decreased in the non-diabetic group, the administration of <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> for 8 weeks in non-diabetic animals increased the alteration in vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictor agents. Thus, it appears that the responses of diabetic and non-diabetic vessels to <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> are mediated by different pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found that <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> administration can improve lipid profile and decrease blood glucose levels, Ca/Mg ratio, and vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictor agents in diabetic animals. It can also decrease vessel atherosclerosis and prevent diabetic vessel complications. In our view, it appears that <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> administration may decrease cardiovascular risk factors in diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Deputy of Research of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn8-medscimonitbasicres-19-133"><p><bold>Source of support:</bold> This research was supported by Deputy of Research of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-medscimonitbasicres-19-133"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>FC</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of Guava (Psidium guajava Linn.) leaf soluble solids on glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetic rats</article-title><source>Phytother Res</source><year>2008</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>1458</fpage><lpage>64</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18819164</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-medscimonitbasicres-19-133"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stamler</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Vaccaro</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Neaton</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Wentworth</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The multiple risk factor intervention trial research group, diabetes, other risk factors and 12-yr cardiovascular mortality for men screened in the multiple risk factor intervention trial</article-title><source>Diabetes Care</source><year>1993</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>434</fpage><lpage>44</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8432214</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-medscimonitbasicres-19-133"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ceriello</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postprandial hyperglycemia and diabetes complications.
