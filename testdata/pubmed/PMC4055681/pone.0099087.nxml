The tool, which consists of a mass and two hand-held non-linear springs, is affected by a saddle-like force-field. The non-linearity of the springs allows the users to determine size and orientation of the tool stiffness ellipse, by using different patterns of bimanual coordination: minimal stiffness occurs when the two spring terminals are aligned and stiffness size grows by stretching them apart. Tool parameters were set such that minimal stiffness is insufficient to provide stable equilibrium whereas asymptotic stability can be achieved with sufficient stretching, although at the expense of greater effort. As a consequence, tool users have two possible strategies for stabilizing the mass in different regions of the workspace: 1) high stiffness feedforward strategy, aiming at asymptotic stability and 2) low stiffness positional feedback strategy aiming at bounded stability. The tool was simulated by a bimanual haptic robot with direct torque control of the motors. In a previous study we analyzed the behavior of na&#x000ef;ve users and we found that they spontaneously clustered into two groups of approximately equal size. In this study we trained subjects to become expert users of both strategies in a discrete reaching task. Then we tested generalization capabilities and mechanism of strategy-switching by means of stabilization tasks which consist of tracking moving targets in the workspace. The uniqueness of the experimental setup is that it addresses the general problem of strategy-switching in an unstable environment, suggesting that complex behaviors cannot be explained in terms of a global optimization criterion but rather require the ability to switch between different sub-optimal mechanisms.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the RBCS Dept. of the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, ACIRAS (Ausili CIbernetici Riabilitativi per la diagnosi e la valutazione quantitativa della disabilit&#x000e0; motoria dell'Arto Superiore nei bambini e negli adulti) Project, Regione Liguria, and DARWIN EU Project (Grant No: FP7-270138).

Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the skilled use of tools implies a modification of the body schema that incorporates the tool as a functional extension of the body <xref rid="pone.0099087-Iriki1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Maravita1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>If a task is stable and the tool is sufficiently rigid, the incorporation of the tool in the body schema and its control require a rather straightforward reorganization of the coordination patterns, equivalent to the modification of the Jacobian matrix of the end-effector. On the contrary, compliant tools employed in unstable tasks require learning of a novel control mechanism by careful integration of multi-joint/multi-limb coordination with stabilization. An example of an underactuated compliant tool is a fishing rod, which is characterized by an infinite number of uncontrollable degrees of freedom. The arm-rod system is described as underactuated because the configuration of the rod is only partially affected by the motor control patterns of the arm but is mainly determined by its intrinsic dynamics. On the other hand, unstable tasks are common components of human activities, like screwing/unscrewing, drilling, inserting a peg in a hole, chiselling, manipulating soft tissues (like in surgery), balancing a pole etc. This study addresses both issues (underactuated control and unstable task) at the same time, further developing a previous work <xref rid="pone.0099087-Saha1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> in which na&#x000ef;ve subjects were exposed to the unknown tool in an unknown environment and managed to find out suitable stabilization strategies.</p><p>The tool, which is simulated by a bimanual haptic robot with direct torque control of the motors, consists of a mass (the &#x02018;tool-tip&#x02019;) and two hand-held non-linear springs. The tool-tip operates in an unstable environment, characterized by a saddle-like force-field. The non-linearity of the two springs allows users to affect size and orientation of the tool stiffness ellipse, by using different patterns of bimanual coordination of the two spring terminals: minimal stiffness occurs when the two terminals are aligned and grows when they are stretched apart. The tool parameters are set such that minimal stiffness is insufficient to provide stable equilibrium of the tool-tip. However, asymptotic stability can be achieved with sufficient stretching at the expense of greater effort. As a consequence, tool users have two possible strategies for stabilizing the tool-tip in different regions of the workspace: 1) high stiffness strategy (Stiffness Stabilization Strategy - SSS), aiming at asymptotic stability, and 2) low stiffness positional strategy (Positional Stabilization Strategy - PSS), aiming at bounded stability in analogy with manual stabilization of an inverted pendulum.</p><p>Unstable tasks have been studied by different authors but these previous experimental designs did not allow for the use of more than one strategy. Consider, for example, the inverted pendulum balancing task by means of a manually operated spring whose stiffness is smaller than the rate of growth of the destabilizing gravity-related torque <xref rid="pone.0099087-Lakie1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>: in this case, the SSS is infeasible, although it is still possible for subjects to succeed at the task. Indeed, they solve the task by producing intermittent stabilization gestures that achieve a regime of bounded oscillations (PSS). Moreover, by decreasing the moment of inertia of the system while keeping constant all the other parameters, the authors observed increased oscillations and we may expect a bifurcation point beyond which subjects would fail the stabilization task. The bifurcation point can be characterized by the falling time constant of the system or the length of an equivalent inverted pendulum: if the time constant is too small (less than 100 ms) or the equivalent inverted pendulum is too short (less than 10 cm), stabilization cannot be achieved. In other words, the PSS has a limited dynamic range, determined by biological parameters, such as the delay of the sensory feedback. Another example, which illustrates an opposite stabilization strategy, is given by the divergent force-field compensation experiments <xref rid="pone.0099087-Burdet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Franklin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>: in this case, the PSS is infeasible because the falling time constant determined by the system parameters is too small. Nevertheless, subjects can learn muscle co-activation patterns that modulate size and orientation of the hand stiffness ellipse in an optimal way, i.e. align the major axis of the ellipse with the direction of the divergent field. In other words, in this example the subjects are forced to choose the SSS due to the parameters of the designed system and muscle elastic properties allow them to achieve the goal. Similar observations apply both to the pole balancing task, because the stiffness is null by construction without any possibilities to increase it, and to human upright standing, because the ankle stiffness is smaller than the critical level determined by gravity <xref rid="pone.0099087-Loram1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Casadio1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It is worth mentioning that, in the upright standing paradigm, the compliance of the Achilles tendon prevails <xref rid="pone.0099087-Loram2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> making co-activation of the ankle muscles ineffective for modulating the ankle stiffness. This does not occur in the case of the arm neuromuscular system because the stiffness of the tendons is great enough for modulating effectively the stiffness ellipse through the co-activation of antagonist muscles.</p><p>The virtual tool described in this paper was designed with the goal of allowing users to choose the stabilization strategy. It is a novel design and, although it is somehow artificial, we think it matches aspects of skilled behavior in real life situations, and thus, can shed some light on how humans deal with problems where multiple strategies are possible.</p><p>The stiffness stabilization strategy (SSS) is basically open-loop and is characterized by a large frequency band, because the implicit positional feedback comes from the elastic properties of the muscles and/or the tool is instantaneous. On the other hand, this strategy requires a high effort level because the stiffness grows with increasing effort <xref rid="pone.0099087-Gomi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-McIntyre1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Milner1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Perreault1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and, for the same load, increasing the stiffness requires some kind of co-activation of antagonist elements <xref rid="pone.0099087-Hogan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Gomi2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In this way it is possible to achieve an &#x02018;asymptotic&#x02019; stability and thus residual oscillations around equilibrium can be attributed to motor noise. The latter grows increasing effort <xref rid="pone.0099087-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Hamilton1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, but can be reduced by impedance control <xref rid="pone.0099087-Selen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>The positional stabilization strategy (PSS) has a smaller bandwidth, because it employs delay-affected explicit positional feedback, but is characterized by a lower level of effort, because it does not require co-activation of antagonistic elements. Following this strategy, the feedback loop can be operated in continuous or discontinuous time. In the former case, however, the large delay in the control loop strongly limits the range of the controller's parameter values that can provide static stability (i.e. compensate the unstable load) without inducing dynamic instability. Intermittent control is more robust <xref rid="pone.0099087-Bottaro1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Asai1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Loram3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> provided that the dynamics of instability are not too fast, i.e. the time constant of the dominant unstable pole is not too small. An intermittent, closed-loop controller of an unstable load, operating with a low level of stiffness, can avoid instability achieving &#x02018;bounded stability&#x02019;. In this case, the residual oscillations around equilibrium are mainly determined by a discrete train of event-driven, predictive stabilization bursts rather than intrinsic motor noise.</p><p>In summary, the two stabilization strategies are characterized by a trade-off between effort and frequency band: if a subject aims at utilizing a small effort, he must accept a small bandwidth, whereas if he wishes or is forced to have a high bandwidth, he must be prepared to apply a suitable amount of effort. However, the choice between the two strategies is not granted in general since the feasibility of either strategy depends on the &#x02018;ergonomic design&#x02019; of the arm+tool system.</p><p>In the aforementioned paper <xref rid="pone.0099087-Saha1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, na&#x000ef;ve subjects were asked to stabilize the end-point of the virtual tool in different target areas of the workspace, where a saddle-like force-field was active. The task had two implicit components: 1) an &#x02018;equilibrium sub-task&#x02019;, which required the two hands to transmit a pair of force vectors to the end-point whose vectorial composition compensated the local force field; 2) a &#x02018;stabilization sub-task&#x02019;, aimed at counteracting the instability of the field using one of the two strategies defined above. In the SSS the two sub-tasks coincide because the achieved equilibrium is stable, whereas in the PSS they are independent. We wish to emphasize the fact that the task is strongly space-variant because the coordination/stabilization patterns vary widely in different parts of the workspace. After an initial exploration of the dynamics of the system, facilitated by the fact that the force-field remained permanently active, all na&#x000ef;ve subjects succeeded in solving the task in the time course of a single session. They did so by quickly settling for one of the two strategies and keeping it consistent for the rest of the experiment: about 60% of the subjects adopted the SSS and 40% the PSS. The fact that the effort required in the former case is about twice the effort in the latter, suggests that minimizing effort is not a primary concern. On one hand, the subjects who adopted the SSS learned a bimanual coordination that oriented the stiffness ellipse of the virtual tool in the optimal way, i.e. they learned to separate the two handles of the virtual tool in the medio-lateral direction. On the other hand, the subjects who adopted the PSS kept the two handles very close to each other, minimizing effort.</p><p>In this paper, using the same experimental setup as described in the previous study, we report the results of a study in which subjects were trained to become &#x02018;conscious&#x02019; expert users of the virtual tool in both strategies. After they became proficient, we conducted a preliminary study to test their generalization capabilities. In this second experiment, we assessed their performance with the same virtual tool in a continuous tracking task that criss-crossed the target areas of the former one. This experiment allows us to observe whenever the switching mechanism between the two strategies occurs, from the high-stiffness to the low-stiffness regime and back.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Virtual Tool</title><p>The subjects were trained to use a Virtual Underactuated Bimanual Tool (VUBT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

</p><p>The origin of the saddle field [<italic>x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub></italic>] is on the sagittal plane of the subject, about 0.5 m forward, with respect to the chest; the <italic>x</italic>-axis is aligned medio-laterally and is the unstable manifold of the field; the <italic>y</italic>-axis is aligned in a posterior-anterior way and is the stable manifold of the field.

VUBT is &#x02018;underactuated&#x02019; because it is impossible to simultaneously control the position of the end-point and the angle between the two linkages: such an angle is an internal degree of freedom that is not directly controlled by the hands but depends on the interaction with the environment.</p><p>The stiffness of each elastic linkage is not constant but grows linearly with the degree of stretch:<disp-formula id="pone.0099087.e010"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e010.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>

Therefore, the subject can indirectly determine the size and orientation of the stiffness ellipse of the tool in order to achieve equilibrium and/or stability.</p><p>The element of the stiffness matrix that is most relevant from the point of view of stability is <italic>K<sub>xx</sub></italic> because it subtracts its value from the instability coefficient <italic>K<sub>u</sub></italic>, reducing the degree of instability along the medio-lateral unstable manifold. This consideration is apparent if we linearize the nonlinear dynamics of the virtual tool (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0099087.e009">equation 1</xref>) in the neighborhood [&#x003b4;<italic>x</italic>, &#x003b4;<italic>y</italic>] of an equilibrium state [<italic>x<sub>e</sub></italic>, <italic>y<sub>e</sub></italic>]:<disp-formula id="pone.0099087.e013"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e013.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>

It appears that the amplitude of such pair of forces remains approximately stationary in the neighborhood of the origin (with a value of about 12 N). Then it decreases smoothly in the <italic>y</italic>-direction (within a range of about &#x000b1;10 cm) and much more abruptly in the <italic>x</italic>-direction (with a smaller range of about &#x000b1;4 cm). The locus of the positions at which the amplitude of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e050.jpg"/></inline-formula> becomes null, i.e. the locus of marginal stability, is &#x02018;peanut-shaped&#x02019; and is more elongated in the <italic>y-</italic> than in the <italic>x</italic>-direction. Let us further clarify the meaning of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g003">Figure 3</xref>. When a subject attempts to stabilize the end-point of the virtual tool in the center of the workspace according to the SSS, the figure says that the minimum amount of medio-lateral separation of the two hands corresponds to a force <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e051.jpg"/></inline-formula> &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12 N. The figure says also that such a minimum degree of separation decreases quickly if the end-point is moved laterally and more slowly for forward/backward movements. Ultimately, the degree of separation and the corresponding force <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e052.jpg"/></inline-formula> become null for a lateral displacement from the center of the workspace greater than &#x000b1;4 cm or for a forward/backward displacement greater than &#x000b1;10 cm. For larger displacements and, more generally, for equilibrium points outside the peanut-shaped contour, the distinction between SSS and PSS disappears: there is no need to stretch laterally the two virtual springs and asymptotic stability is achieved anyway.</p><fig id="pone-0099087-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0099087.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Forces and stability.</title><p>Distribution over the workspace of the magnitude of the pair of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e053.jpg"/></inline-formula> forces that must be applied in order to reach the condition of marginal stability. <bold>Panel A:</bold> 3D-plot; <bold>Panel B:</bold> contour plot.

In the standard bimanual coordination, this equilibrium condition is characterized by null effort and can only occur when the target is in the origin of the force-field. It is also unstable because <italic>K<sub>xx</sub></italic> is only half the minimum value required by marginal stability. For target areas which are situated increasingly away from the origin, the field intensity (as well as the minimum effort) grows linearly with the distance. As a consequence, also the corresponding VUBT stiffness increases, and in particular the critical <italic>K<sub>xx</sub></italic> element, gradually approaching the condition of marginal stability defined above. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g003">Figure 3</xref> includes the peanut-shaped locus of points for which marginal stability is achieved in the case of standard bimanual coordination:</p><p>&#x02022; For the points inside the locus the subjects have a choice: 1) to stick to the standard coordination, which minimizes the effort, forcing them to achieve bounded stability in an active way by means of carefully timed trains of corrective commands; 2) to supplement the standard coordination by stretching both springs up to the point in which asymptotic stability is achieved with a suitable pair of forces <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e054.jpg"/></inline-formula>, at the expense of increased effort. In this case, the subjects can also choose the direction in which to apply the opposite forces <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e055.jpg"/></inline-formula>. This direction affects the orientation of the stiffness ellipse in a rather complicated way. However, it is possible to demonstrate numerically that if &#x00394;<italic>F</italic> is comparable to the intensity of the local force field the orientation of the stiffness ellipse is very close to the orientation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e056.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Thus, in the optimal stiffness strategy the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e057.jpg"/></inline-formula> is oriented along the unstable manifold of the field, i.e. medio-laterally. Instead, the amount of lateral stretching is not unique as it depends on the distance from the origin and the position of the target. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows that the required stretch is a decreasing function of the distance from the origin. Therefore, a subject that has learnt to stabilize the virtual mass in the center (according to the stiffness strategy) will be able to apply the required lateral stretch also in the periphery of the workspace.</p><p>&#x02022; For target points outside that locus, the standard coordination pattern satisfies both the equilibrium condition (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0099087.e022">equation 11</xref>) and the stability condition at the same time.</p><p>During transient corrective motions, the equilibrium condition expressed in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0099087.e022">equation 11</xref> is not satisfied and the following equation holds: <disp-formula id="pone.0099087.e058"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e058.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>

Each robot has a large planar workspace (0.8&#x000d7;0.4 m ellipse) and a rigid structure with two direct-drive, brushless motors, and low intrinsic mechanical impedance. These features allow direct estimation of forces applied to the hand of the user by the robot from the commanded currents. Each robot can measure the trajectory of the hand with high-resolution (0.1 mm) and is capable of applying forces at the corresponding handle. The control architecture is based on the real-time operating system RT-Lab&#x000ae; and includes three nested control loops: 1) an inner 16 kHz current loop; 2) an intermediate 1 kHz impedance control loop; 3) an outer 100 Hz loop for visual display and data storage. The two identical planar robots are mounted in a mirrored configuration on the same rigid frame, which allows independent regulation of vertical and horizontal position. They are positioned horizontally as close as possible (distance between the axes of the motors 38.5 cm), in order to maximize the overlap of the corresponding workspaces. The vertical position of the robot linked to the right hand was adjusted for each subject in order to keep the right arm approximately horizontal. The other robot was slightly shifted downward in order to avoid interference between the two arms. For the same reason, the handle of the former robot was directed upward, whereas the handle of the latter robot was directed downward. The positions of the two handles were calibrated with respect to a common reference frame, which was used for all the relevant variables of the experiments. The robot is equipped with a 24.5&#x02033; LCD screen with resolution of 1920&#x000d7;1200 and 100 Hz refresh rate. The workspace is mapped on the screen with a unary magnification factor so that a displacement of 1 cm of the hand corresponds exactly to 1 cm on the screen. The screen is positioned vertically in front of the subject and horizontally 30 cm beyond the center of the workspace.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Subjects, Task &#x00026; Protocol</title><p>Eight healthy, subjects (age &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 29.1&#x000b1;1.6 years) participated in the experiment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099087-t002">Table 2</xref>).

Only after there was evidence that they could indeed switch between one strategy and the other the experiments were started according to the protocol described below.</p><p>The subjects sat in a chair, with their trunk restrained by means of a seat belt and their sternum aligned with the midline of the bimanual robot at a distance of approximately 40 cm from the center of the workspace. The hands grasped the handles of the robot and faced the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Vision of the position of the hand and the robot was not hidden. Nevertheless, subjects were instructed to concentrate on the displayed image and not to look at their hands or the robot's configuration during the experiment.</p><fig id="pone-0099087-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0099087.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Experimental setup.</title><p>The subject sits in front of the screen grasping the handles of the bimanual robot with the hands.

All the eight subjects took part in task A, while task B was performed by 6 out of the 8 subjects who agreed to participate in the first experiment, since two subjects had to withdraw from the study. The unstable force-field is continuously active throughout the experimental sessions. This is an important difference from other experiments reported in the literature, in which the source of instability is activated/deactivated for each single trial. We believe indeed that robust learning is facilitated by an invariant context.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Task A</title><p>The task is to stabilize the end-point of the virtual tool (represented as a circle with a 1 cm diameter) in one of 9 circular target areas (2 cm diameter), uniformly distributed on the periphery of a circle (8 cm diameter) and in the center. The stabilization requirement is to constrain the tool-tip oscillations inside the current target for a continuous time interval of 4 s. Each experimental session included 2 target-sets (12 center-out movements and 12 return movements per set): the first one performed by using the SSS and the second one by using the PSS. The timing was driven by the behavior of the subjects: the new target was presented after a subject succeeded in stabilizing the mass inside the target region. This means that if a subject entered in the target area but exited before the prescribed time, the time counter was reset for a new stabilization attempt. For this reason, the time required to complete an experimental session varied within 5 minutes (expert user) and 1 hour (na&#x000ef;ve user) according to the skillfulness of the subject. We allowed subjects to take a short break of 5 minutes only after completing a target set. The number of sessions was chosen after a pilot test on one subject, who practiced for 22 sessions (44 sets) <xref rid="pone.0099087-Zenzeri1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Results showed that the subject's performance stabilized after 10 sessions (20 sets) suggesting that a protocol of 10 training sessions might be adequate for our purposes. Therefore, the protocol for task A consisted of 10 sessions on 10 different days, consecutive sessions being no more than 2 days apart.</p><p>The values of the dynamical parameters of the system used in the experiment (<italic>M</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15 kg, <italic>B</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;132 N/m/s) were chosen after evaluating the effect of decreasing the controllability of the tool in every strategy for a single subject. For the PSS, the mass of the tool was systematically decreased while keeping the damping factor &#x003b6; constant (this implies to compute the value of B from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0099087.e017">equation 7</xref>) in order to reduce &#x003c4;<sub>u</sub>. In the case of the SSS, we systematically increased the mass of the system in order to vary &#x003b6;, while keeping B constant.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Task B</title><p>The generalization capabilities of six trained experts (S1, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8) were tested in a single-session tracking exercise along four differently shaped trajectories, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g005">Figure 5</xref>. The goal was to match the motion of a smoothly moving target, generated in the workspace with paths of increasing shape complexity: a vertical ellipse (panel B1) laying in the marginal-stability region; a horizontal ellipse (panel B2) having the extreme points outside the marginal-stability manifold; a clover (panel B3) that combines the two previous shapes; a spiral (panel B4), which stems from the region of marginal stability and ends over the unstable manifold. The subject had no previous knowledge or visual hints about the shape of the path and no constraints regarding the strategy to use to accomplish the task. According to our expectations, however, inside the marginal-stability contour subjects should be free to choose one stabilization strategy or the other. Outside this region, instead, they should be forced to apply the stiffness strategy only.</p><fig id="pone-0099087-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0099087.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Layout of the targets in the different tasks.</title><p>In all the panels the eight peripheral targets (in red) and the central parget (in blue) are related to task A.

Summarizing, the generalization session is composed of 8 tracking blocks: odd blocks correspond to the familiarization condition and consist of one trial, while even blocks correspond to the unstable condition and last for three trials. The target path was changed every two blocks in the following order: B1 - B2 - B3 - B4. The condition for the beginning of the familiarization trial and the first trial under instability is that the mass is stabilized inside the starting point of the trajectory (diameter&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2 cm) for at least 3 s. In the case of the unstable condition, the subsequent two trials begin without requiring the target to stop on the starting point, so that the tracking continues without interruptions. The laps count follows the target motion irrespectively of the position of the tool-tip, so that every lap is considered complete whenever the target returned in/passed through the starting position. We report the details of the four tracking subtasks hereinafter. On purpose, we chose the velocity of the target to be small enough, in order to present to the subjects a quasi-static stabilization task, although in different parts of the workspace that were not experienced before. For much faster movements the subjects would have to learn a novel and much more difficult task because the stable and unstable manifolds would span a two dimensional plane in a four dimensional space <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e067.jpg"/></inline-formula>, with little chance of generalization from the previous training.</p><p>B1) Vertical ellipse</p><p>In the subtask B1 the target to be pursued runs along an elliptical trajectory as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g005">Figure 5</xref> panel B1 and is described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0099087.e068">equation 12</xref>:<disp-formula id="pone.0099087.e068"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e068.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(12)</label></disp-formula>

The transient state from the initial to the final configuration is characterized by a loss of equilibrium in the initial part of the movement and by a recovery of a new equilibrium in the final part. A slight imbalance between the two hands during the transient may induce large oscillations, particularly if the PSS is used. However, it is apparent that such oscillations, quite visible in early training, tend to disappear when the user masters the tool.</p><fig id="pone-0099087-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0099087.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Example of performance in task A (reaching) by subject S1 in the early and final phase of training.</title><p>Panels A, A1, A2 refer to the SSS and panels B, B1, B2 to the PSS.

For the PSS: hand trajectories (black and gray lines), virtual mass trajectory (green lines), final positions of the left hand (green square), right hand (green triangle) and virtual mass (green circle). In both cases the tool-tip is initially at equilibrium in the forward target and the task is to move it to the central target.

The three panels report the motion patterns recorded both in the first target-set, after the familiarization phase, and in the final target-set, when the subject could be qualified as an &#x0201c;expert user&#x0201d;. At the beginning of the coordinated movement pattern, the two hands are beyond the target and well-separated sideways. Thereafter, during the programmed movement of the end-point of the virtual tool, the subject keeps the sideway separation of the two hands while shifting the tool-tip towards the stable manifold of the field. In the first target set, the small coordination error causes a rightward deviation of the virtual mass that then misses the target area. The error is diminished by further increasing the lateral separation of the hands, which in turn increases both stiffness and effort. Ultimately, in the last target-set, the control pattern is similar but better calibrated and thus the equilibrium in the central target is achieved in the first attempt, without a further increase of stiffness.</p><p>Panels B, B1, B2 illustrate the performance of the same subject when asked to operate according to the PSS. The initial configuration is quite different with respect to the previous case: the two hands are overlapped and well beyond the target, in such a way that both elastic linkages are aligned with the local field. During the intended movement, the lateral separation of the two hands remains rather small but the inaccuracy of the motion in the first target-set determines an imbalance that pushes the virtual mass on the left, without a significant compensatory movement of the two hands, at least in the first part. The lateral error is corrected by means of a number of correction bursts that finally succeeds to constrain the postural oscillations within the target, as required by the task. In the final target-set, the coordination pattern is similar but clearly more accurate because the target is hit in the first movement and few lateral adjustments, with the paired hands, are necessary to stabilize the posture.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g007">Figure 7</xref> shows a complementary aspect of the expert user performance that concerns the typical speed profiles of the tool-tip. In particular, we can observe that after the subject hits the target and succeeds to keep the tool-tip inside the target area for the prescribed duration, the residual oscillations tend to be damped out in the SSS (asymptotic stability), whereas they persist in the PSS, highlighting a bounded stability regime.</p><fig id="pone-0099087-g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0099087.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Task A: typical speed profiles of the tool-tip.</title><p>The figure shows typical speed profiles of a well-trained subject when using the two strategies (SSS: black curve; PSS: blue curve).

In particular, we expect that the undertaken corrective actions will differ according to the adopted motor strategy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows a representative example, in which S4 has to bring and stabilize the virtual tool from the topmost target into the origin (red circles) of the saddle-like force-field, first following the high stiffness strategy (panel A) and later the positional strategy (panel B). As previously explained, when the equilibrium conditions are not met, the resultant of the forces acting on the virtual tool is not null, causing the mass to move (black trajectory in the left graphs of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In this case, the subject can either control the motion of the ball by applying two forces <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e078.jpg"/></inline-formula> that interfere with the local field <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e079.jpg"/></inline-formula> or let the virtual mass move according to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e080.jpg"/></inline-formula>. In particular, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g008">Figure 8</xref>, the portions of the signals corresponding to corrective motions that contrast the local field (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e081.jpg"/></inline-formula>) are highlighted in light blue. The resultant of the forces is reported in the graphs entitled &#x02018;Net VUBT force&#x02019;. As it can be noted, under both strategies, the net force is maximal at the beginning of the trial and tends to decrease to zero during the stabilization phase (last 4 s). The difference between the two conditions in panel A (SSS) and B (PSS) resides in the magnitude of the forces applied by the hands. In the case of the SSS, the hands tend to apply symmetrical forces with respect to the y-axis up to the point in which the local field makes the virtual mass deviate from the vertical line connecting the two targets. At this point, the hand forces an imbalance in favor of the right hand to contrast the leftward shift in position imposed by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0099087.e082.jpg"/></inline-formula> and bring the tool inside the target area. Successively the left hand acts to damp the oscillations of the tool around the equilibrium position. In the case of the PSS, the two hands always act synchronously, as we expected. Despite the system being less rigid than in the SSS, the positional strategy is effective in controlling the tool-tip position and requires the subject to apply forces of much lower intensity.</p><fig id="pone-0099087-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0099087.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Task A: typical trajectory and force profiles during corrective motions.</title><p>The figure shows a transient motion between two stabilization phases for S4 in the case of the SSS (panel A) and the PSS (panel B).

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g009">Figure 9</xref> shows the relation between the Stiffness Size index and the Stiffness Orientation Index when the subjects are asked to adhere to one strategy or the other, in the first compared to the last session of the training. The vertical line (<italic>SSI</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1) corresponds to the situation in which the bimanual coordination is such that the medio-lateral component of the stiffness matrix of the virtual tool balances the instability coefficient of the force-field. On the left of that line, the stabilization strategy is classified as PSS; on the right it is classified as SSS. Already immediately after the familiarization phase, all the subjects succeed in satisfying the task requirements, distributing on the right hemiplane when performing the SSS (blue ellipse &#x02013; centroid &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; [1.56; 0.99]) and on the left one during the PSS (orange ellipse &#x02013; centroid &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; [0.94; 0.83]). Moreover, we observe that at the end of training all the subjects reduced their operating stiffness and consequently the <italic>SSI</italic> as well as the employed effort (SSS - gray ellipse: centroid &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; [1.21;0.98], PSS - red ellipse: centroid &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; [0.79;0.77]). If SSI decreases also the degree of stretching of the two springs decreases, thus reducing the required effort. Globally, we notice that the variability among subjects related to the <italic>SSI</italic> is much reduced at the end of the training (SSS pre&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.13; SSS post&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05; PSS pre&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03; PSS post&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01) indicating the accomplishment of similar performance. To analyze the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g009">Figure 9</xref> more in-depth, we compared the Stiffness Size Index and the Stiffness Orientation Index values among the two strategies (SSS, PSS) both in the beginning (pre) and in the end (post) of the training. In particular, according to the Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, SSI values in the two strategies differ significantly, independent of the skillfulness level (SSS pre - PSS pre and SSS post - PSS post: <italic>U</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 two-tailed): median [IQR] values are 1.43 [0.52] for SSS pre and 0.94 [&#x0003c;0.01] for PSS pre (first comparison), 1.21 [0.22] for SSS post and 0.79 [0.06] for PSS post (second comparison). The same applies to the SOI values: median [IQR] values are 0.99 [0.01] for SSS pre and 0.83 [0.04] for PSS pre (first comparison), 0.98 [0.03] for SSS post and 0.77 [0.03] for PSS post (last comparison). In addition, the training determined a significant variation in the SSI indicator medians according to the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed-rank test in both conditions (SSS pre-post: <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.025; PSS pre-post: <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.012) and in the SOI indicator medians in the case of PSS strategy (SSS pre-post: <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.069; PSS pre-post: <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.025).As already suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g009">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g010">Figure 10</xref> highlights a consistent reduction in the effort employed by the subjects in both strategies as a consequence of the training (SSS: &#x02212;47.2%, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.017, <italic>T</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1; PSS: &#x02212;34.0%; <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.012, <italic>T</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0), resulting from a Wilcoxon match pairs signed-rank on the effort values in each strategy comparing the first and the last sessions. However, in the SSS case the level of effort (median [IQR]: 40.17&#x000b1;15.07 N) remains significantly higher (Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic> test: <italic>U</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 two-tailed) than in the case of PSS (median [IQR]: 14.50&#x000b1;2.53 N).</p><p>One may expect a trade-off between the effort and the time required to reach the target when switching from one strategy to the other and this is clearly the case. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g011">Figure 11</xref> shows the evolution of the Time to Target indicator over the training. In both conditions the indicator reaches a steady state value that, despite being inferior for the SSS (median [IQR]: 1.97 [0.44] s) with respect to the PSS (median [IQR]: 3.77 [4.86] s), is not significantly different between the two strategies (Mann Whitney U test: <italic>U</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.052 two-tailed). The fact that reaching time under the SSS, condition is lower can be explained considering that in the SSS the environmental instability is &#x02018;hidden&#x02019; by the high stiffness value of the tool, although at the expense of great effort. In contrast, the reaching movements of the PSS case, e.g. the movement illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g006">Figure 6</xref>, require concurrent active control along the <italic>y</italic>-axis for approaching the target and active generation of stabilization bursts along the <italic>x</italic>-axis for avoiding instability, lengthening the time required for achieving both goals.</p><p>The analysis of the Bimanual Separation Index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g012">Figure 12</xref>) complements the overall picture illustrated by the analysis of the other indicators. As expected, the figure shows that the <italic>BSI</italic> is markedly different in the two strategies and is much higher in the SSS case (always above 13 cm of difference). In particular, we observe that the training reduces the separation between the two hands in the stiffness strategy only (&#x02212;7 cm), partially explaining the reduction of effort in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g010">Figure 10</xref>. The <italic>BSI</italic> difference across conditions is relevant to ascertain that all the subjects executed the task correctly and they didn't overlap the two strategies during the training. Indeed, in the SSS case they learned to keep the two hands sufficiently separated sideways, whereas in the PSS case they understood that the two hands should be considered as a single unit and focused on fine, synergic stabilizing corrections.</p><p>As a next step, it is worth characterizing in a quantitative manner the &#x0201c;postural component&#x0201d; of the task, namely the process by which the subjects succeed in constraining the &#x0201c;sway movements&#x0201d; of the end-point of the virtual tool (i.e. the virtual mass) inside the target area, during the stabilization interval. This process must be active in both strategies: this is obvious both in the PSS case, because the virtual tool is operated in a condition of mechanical instability, and in the SSS case, because the intrinsic muscle noise associated with the high effort level can generate fluctuations that need to be compensated, despite the mechanical stability of the virtual tool. To better highlight differences in the two control strategies, we analyzed the Magnitude of the Velocity Peaks and Frequency of the Velocity Peaks indicators both for the virtual mass speed and the hands speed.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g013">Figure 13</xref> displays the time course of the <italic>MVP</italic> indicator computed on the virtual mass speed profile throughout the training. At the beginning, the SSS required the subject to perform grosser corrections to keep the tool-tip inside the target position (M &#x000b1; SE: 1.64&#x000b1;0.08 cm/s), if compared to PSS (M &#x000b1; SE: 1.33&#x000b1;0.09 cm/s). This difference holds until learning advances: after the 6<sup>th</sup> &#x02013;7<sup>th</sup> session, such a difference tends to disappear (M &#x000b1; SE session 10: SSS 1.36&#x000b1;0.07 cm/s; PSS 1.32&#x000b1;0.04 cm/s). Noticeably, the same sessions correspond to the initial plateau phase for the time to target indicator in the SSS case, denoting a consistent learning. This kind of invariance at the final stages of training can be partly explained by the design of the task, namely the size of the target in relation to the intensity of the force-field. On average, the <italic>MVP</italic> data computed in the case of the mass are not significantly different between the two strategies (one-way ANOVA with strategy as factor, subjects as random effect, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.068). Interestingly, the employed stabilization strategy significantly influences the <italic>MVP</italic> computed on hands speed (one-way ANOVA with strategy as factor, hand as nested factor, subjects as random effect, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;&#x0003c;0.001, <italic>F</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;37.71, <italic>partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.64). In particular, the <italic>MVP</italic> value is not dependent upon the considered hand (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.56, <italic>F</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.60) and tends to be much greater in the PSS (M &#x000b1; SE &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 2.28&#x000b1;0.11 cm/s) than the SSS (M &#x000b1; SE &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 1.75&#x000b1;0.07 cm/s). This should not be surprising, since it strongly depends on the stiffness properties of the VUBT. The tool in the postural condition is characterized by a much lower stiffness that slows down the response of the system to perturbation applied at the hands. Hence, we may expect that the frequency of the corrective actions performed by the hands in the PSS is lower than that in the SSS. Indeed, when considering the Frequency of the Velocity Peaks indicator the two strategies strongly differ (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;&#x0003c;0.001, <italic>F</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;199.60, <italic>partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.90), where the mean <italic>FVP</italic> (M &#x000b1; SE) is equal to 2.17&#x000b1;0.02 Hz in the PSS and 2.37&#x000b1;0.01 Hz in the SSS, and is not dependent on one particular hand (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.23, <italic>F</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.58). This difference is amplified when considering the mean oscillations of the virtual mass velocity that are remarkably slower in the PSS (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;&#x0003c;0.001, <italic>F</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;34.47, <italic>partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.71; M &#x000b1; SE: PSS: 1.24&#x000b1;0.02 Hz; SSS: 1.43&#x000b1;0.02 Hz). Therefore, the results obtained for the <italic>MVP</italic> and the <italic>FVP</italic> indicator support the idea that similar postural performance levels can be achieved by strongly different control strategies.</p><p>Finally, let us consider the result of the sensitivity analysis carried out on a subject at the end of his training, according to the criteria described in the methods. For the PSS we considered systematic reductions of the virtual mass from its nominal value of 15 kg, while maintaining the damping factor of the virtual tool fixed. For the SSS we systematically increased the virtual mass while reducing the damping factor. Among the different performance indicators we focused on <italic>TT</italic> because it clearly identifies the difficulty in achieving the task. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g014">Figure 14</xref> plots the variations of <italic>TT</italic> when <italic>M</italic> is increased (SSS) or decreased (PSS), indicating that a trained user of the virtual tool can manage a variation of the virtual mass in a rather large range, namely between 4 kg and 25 kg. This result can be attributed to the generalization capability of the trained subject. Moreover, it confirms the rationale of the design of the virtual tool, described in the method, in the sense that the choice of the tool parameters appears to be rather &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d;, with regard to the choice of stabilization strategy, and close to optimal, with regard to the time-to-target.</p><fig id="pone-0099087-g014" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0099087.g014</object-id><label>Figure 14</label><caption><title>Task A: sensitivity of a performance parameter (<italic>TT, Time to Target</italic>) to variations of the virtual mass.</title><p>The blue curve corresponds to the PSS: in this case, the damping factor &#x003b6; is maintained constant and the values of the virtual mass and of viscosity are reduced systematically from the nominal values, with a dramatic reduction of performance when the mass is reduced below 6 kg.

The intrinsic dynamics of the environment implies coordination and stabilization patterns that change continuously from point to point of the workspace. Thus, it is unlikely that the extensive training in the reaching task allowed the subjects to accumulate the &#x0201c;dense&#x0201d; experience of the environmental dynamics that is required in the task B.</p><p>The metrics used for evaluating the generalization capability is based on the tracking performance and how the subjects comply with the task by using the learned strategies.</p><p>The subjects were not encouraged to prefer one strategy or the other during the overall tracking or parts of it, but a working hypothesis is to expect all of them to choose the stiffness strategy as the preferred one when moving outside the peanut-shaped marginal stability region. On the contrary, the adopted strategy might vary among subjects when the tip of the virtual tool is moving inside the boundary of that particular region.</p><p>In order to elucidate the actual performance, we first computed the <italic>SSI</italic> to discriminate between the two strategies: <italic>SSI</italic> &#x0003c; 1 &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; <italic>PSS</italic>, <italic>SSI</italic> &#x0003e; 1 &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; <italic>SSS</italic>, with a tolerance of 10% around the boundary. Secondly, we sought for any particular distribution of the strategies along the trajectory in each of the subtasks to assess if the choice of a strategy could be accounted for by the properties of the workspace region in which the end-tool was actually moving. Finally, we compared this indicator with the tracking error and its time derivative so as to investigate if the chosen strategy could account for differences in the tracking performance.</p><p>The analysis of the tracking error indicator in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099087-t003">Table 3</xref> shows that, in the case of subtask B1 and B2, the subjects tend, on average, to improve their tracking abilities in time. Considering the final lap, the mean tracking error along the whole trajectory is always inferior to 2.15 cm, suggesting that skilled subjects succeeded in tracking the moving target within the prescribed time in these two simpler subtasks. The same is not true when considering untrained subjects, who could not fulfill the exercise requirements in any of the four subtasks. Considering subtasks B3 and B4, the performance of the subjects vary from lap to lap. For instance, the tracking error for subject S8 in B4 varied from 1.01 cm (lap 1) to 4.18 cm (lap 3). This can be imputed to the choice of the strategy to employ inside the region of marginal stability and to the greater variability in the local unstable field direction along the trajectory.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0099087-t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0099087.t003</object-id><label>Table

the <italic>SSI</italic> and the percentage of PSS choice throughout each trial, reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0099087-t004">Table 4</xref>. By taking a closer look at these data, we can observe that S7 never adopted the PSS, while all the other subjects showed no preferred strategy when the target was moving inside the marginal stability region and demonstrated capability to freely switch from one strategy to the other. However, when the target was sliding away from that region, the strategy choice was forced towards the SSS, as our hypothesis suggested. This behavior is highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g015">Figure 15</xref>, which summarizes the mean <italic>SSI</italic> evolution over time (panels A1, A2, A3, A4) and the desired trajectory (panels B1, B2, B3, B4) for the four subtasks in the case of PSS&#x0003e;20%.

a point of interest, we report that switching from PSS to SSS was associated to a reduction in the rate of growth of the tracking error in the great majority of the cases (e.g. <italic>SSI</italic> for t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4 s). This consideration suggests that our brain might adopt the stiffness strategy as a way to reduce errors due to inefficacy of intermittent control. Indeed, when dealing with uncertainties in the environment, increasing the end-point stiffness improves stability and provides a better control over the position in time <xref rid="pone.0099087-Selen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The experiments have demonstrated that if a subject is required to stabilize an unstable load and the dynamics of the load allows for two different control strategies, namely a high-stiffness/high-effort strategy and a low-stiffness/low-effort strategy, suitable training is sufficient to master both strategies and to switch from one to the other. In general, this is a preliminary but relevant piece of information to understand how the brain can switch among different strategies during complex motor tasks, such as when car drivers switch from one gear to another in different driving conditions. At the same time, the knowledge of such mechanisms is important from the point of view of &#x02018;human factors&#x02019; in the design of ergonomic man-machine interfaces that involve compliant interaction and instability.</p><p>It is also remarkable that, for both strategies, the subjects were able to generalize the knowledge stored in the learned coordination/control models even though the combination of force intensity, force direction, bimanual coordination, and appropriate stiffness in the different parts of the workspace is variable in a continuous manner. Thus training in a discrete task, like reaching a limited number of targets, was good enough to achieve almost immediately good performance also in a continuous task-like tracking.</p><p>In most of the studies on force-field adaptation, since the seminal paper by Shadmehr &#x00026; Mussa Ivaldi <xref rid="pone.0099087-Shadmehr1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, the focus is on movement more than postural stability, as related to the mechanisms of initiation and termination of movement. Although this is somewhat understandable when dealing with adaptation to stable dynamics, it is less so with unstable dynamics <xref rid="pone.0099087-Burdet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Franklin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Franklin2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>: posture and movement, in general, are related but are characterized by highly specific features as it is evident, for example, in the antinomy between gait and standing posture. In the case of arm movements, the posture/movement distinction is particularly strong if we consider discrete, fast movements whereas it is somehow blurred in the case of continuous, relatively slow tracking movements. In any case, we believe that isolating posture from movement, for example by switching on/off the unstable force-field at the beginning/termination of movements, as in <xref rid="pone.0099087-Burdet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, is likely to break down the ecological continuity of purposive actions and introduce an element of artificiality in the experimental paradigm. For this reason we think that in the study of adaptation to unstable environments the subjects should be exposed persistently to a source of instability, as we have done in our experiments.</p><p>Along a similar line of thinking, we believe that questions about interference in a learning independent internal model, for adaptation to different dynamics and visuomotor transformations <xref rid="pone.0099087-BrashersKrug1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Shadmehr2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Karniel1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Caithness1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Mattar1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, are somewhat artificial because what really matters, from the ecological point of view, are purposive actions, not a set of movements or internal models. From this point of view, we agree with the emphasis on the importance of context, for integrating in a single control mechanism multiple model, which has been advocated, for example, by Howard et al. <xref rid="pone.0099087-Howard1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>The type of control applied by the expert user to the virtual compliant tool is basically positional bimanual control. Only in this way would the stiffness properties and the intrinsic dynamics of the tool, while interacting with the unstable environment, allow for predictions to be made. In fact, whatever the chosen stabilization strategy, the subject must figure out how to stretch the two non-linear springs, namely where to put the two spring terminals, in order to compensate intensity and direction of the local field at the current target position. This is clearly a feedforward computation, reflecting a model of the force-field acting on the tool. However, compensating the disturbing effect of the field (in a feedforward manner) is only one side of the required answer: the other side is stabilization, either asymptotic or bounded. In the former case, we are again in the presence of a feedfoward mechanism, which must memorize the degree of lateral stretching of the two spring terminals which is appropriate in different parts of the workspace. In the latter case, when the two spring terminals are kept quite close to each other (with a very small value of the Bimanual Separation Index) the required control paradigm is feedback positional control, quite similar to the stabilization of a manually-held inverted pendulum or the human upright posture: in both cases, the recorded postural sway patterns can be attributed to intermittent feedback control <xref rid="pone.0099087-Bottaro1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Asai1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Loram3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Milton1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Thus feedforward, feedback, and stiffness control paradigms are deeply interrelated in the investigated experimental environment, in a similar way to real life tasks that entail tools interacting with material properties of manipulated objects. The &#x0201c;hybrid&#x0201d; nature of such interaction paradigms is not compatible with a global optimization scenario, but rather suggests a local scenario, in agreement with the work of Ganesh et al. <xref rid="pone.0099087-Ganesh1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, who addressed the issue of sub-optimality in motor planning and the role of &#x0201c;motor memory&#x0201d; in consolidating the choice of a suboptimal strategy, by showing the role of motor memory in the local minimization of task-specific variables. In our case, for example, when the subjects switch to the SSS they also implicitly make a sub-optimal choice, because they orient the stiffness ellipse in the optimal way, given the strategy, namely with the long axis aligned to the unstable manifold of the field. In contrast, when they switch back to the PSS they also abandon the stiffness orientation issue and focus instead on appropriately timed correction bursts that can provide bounded stabilization. In regard to the issue of a possible &#x0201c;meta-strategy&#x0201d; of strategy switching in task B, we may say that the data suggest a tendency to prefer SSS when the target exits the marginal stability area (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099087-g016">Figure 16</xref>), whereas there are alternations between the two regimes when the target hovers inside that region, without any clear selection criterion. However, in the latter case, it appears that, from the data, the switching mechanism is rather slow, in the sense that when a strategy is selected it remains the same for several seconds. We may speculate that in this case the subjects may play a trade-off between precision and effort. Let us use an automotive metaphor, namely let us compare strategy shifting to manual gear shift in a car, with SSS as a lower and PSS as a higher gear: one may shift down the gear to SSS when he wishes to stay well on target, for example when overtaking another car, and then shifts up to PSS when that requirement is relaxed and/or wishes to avoid overheating the engine and wasting excessive fuel.</p><p>A related issue is the identification of the reference frame that best explains force-field adaptation and generalization. The literature in this area is mostly related to stable dynamics and since the seminal paper by Shadmehr &#x00026; Mussa Ivaldi <xref rid="pone.0099087-Shadmehr1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> has concluded that the adaptation process takes place in joint coordinates and is characterized by spatial generalization <xref rid="pone.0099087-Gandolfo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Conditt1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Shadmehr3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Malfait1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099087-Malfait2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, although a recent study <xref rid="pone.0099087-Berniker1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> challenges the posited predominance of a single global coordinate system and suggests instead mixed coordinate representations and local learning. Our experiments agree with this &#x0201c;hybrid&#x0201d; representational paradigm also suggesting pairing it with the previously defined &#x0201c;hybrid&#x0201d; control paradigm. Moreover, our experiments go one step further, emphasizing the crucial role of the &#x0201c;tool space&#x0201d;, in addition to the &#x0201c;joint space&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;end-effector space&#x0201d;, in the representation, organization, and control of the virtual tool in the investigated unstable task.
