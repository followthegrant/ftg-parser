isolation of microsized entities such as microplastics
and resistant bacteria from waste streams is becoming a growing environmental
challenge. By studying the on-flow immobilization of micron-sized
polystyrene particles onto functionalized silica surfaces, we ascertain
if supramolecular host&#x02013;guest chemistry in aqueous solutions
can provide an alternative technology for water purification. Polystyrene
particles were modified with different degrees of adamantane (guest)
molecules, and silica surfaces were patterned with &#x003b2;-cyclodextrin
(&#x003b2;-CD, host) through microcontact printing (&#x003bc;CP). The
latter was exposed to solutions of these particles flowing at different
speeds, allowing us to study the effect of flow rate and multivalency
on particle binding to the surface. The obtained binding profile was
correlated with Comsol simulations. We also observed that particle
binding is directly aligned with particle&#x02019;s ability to form
host&#x02013;guest interactions with the &#x003b2;-CD-patterned surface,
as particle binding to the functionalized glass surface increased
with higher adamantane load on the polystyrene particle surface. Because
of the noncovalent character of these interactions, immobilization
is reversible and modified &#x003b2;-CD surfaces can be recycled, which
provides a positive outlook for their incorporation in water purification
systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>microparticles</kwd><kwd>flow cell</kwd><kwd>water purification</kwd><kwd>microcontact printing</kwd><kwd>supramolecular chemistry</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>am9b11069</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>am-2019-11069d</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Studying the interactions of microparticles with chemically modified
surfaces is an important step in the development of cell-targeting
platforms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Immobilization of cells, for instance, bacteria,
to monolayers on surfaces provides an interesting field of research,
especially toward medical or water treatment applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> However, within complex biological systems, such as bacterial cells,
it is difficult to investigate specific surface adhesion interactions
of microsized entities with functionalized surfaces. Importantly,
the feasibility of particle adhesion interactions with respect to
different length scales being studied, that is, between microparticles
and molecules, should be confirmed using a more controllable model
system. Therefore, the use of model microparticles such as polystyrene
(PS) particles, which have the same size as most bacteria, is a versatile
and valuable tool for investigating adhesion onto chemically functionalized
surfaces.</p><p>In nature, the binding mechanisms of microsized entities
such as
cells are governed by numerous amounts of interactions. Among these
interactions, hydrophobicity plays a significant role in the attachment
or detachment of cells to surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Therefore,
Whitesides et al. have carried out protein and cell adhesion studies
by using monolayers of alkanethiolates or alkylsilanes on gold or
silicon surfaces in order to mimic cell-binding mechanisms within
nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Patterning of the surfaces through a soft lithographic technique,
such as microcontact printing (&#x003bc;CP),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> allowed for spatial control of cell adhesion, which improved confirmation
of binding during analysis. In order to acquire more specificity within
cell adhesion studies, different targeting agents for bacteria were
investigated by Sankaran et al., who adhered bacteria to surfaces
via an azobenzene&#x02013;mannose linker and a transmembrane protein
containing tryptophan and phenylalanine on cucurbit[8]uril layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Moreover, Di Iorio et al. studied the binding kinetics of virus
mimics to sialic acid residues via weak multivalent interactions in
order to predict the number of interactions involved in binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Based on these advances, the implementation
and investigation of supramolecular and multivalent interactions for
high-affinity, noncovalent, and reversible binding is an important
aspect for understanding cell immobilization. We here exploit this
type of binding as an outlook toward water treatment applications,
as it is desirable to capture cells rapidly and subsequently release
immobilized cells for reusability of surfaces.</p><p>For fabrication
of reusable surfaces, we selected the noncovalent
binding of adamantane (Ad) to &#x003b2;-cyclodextrin (&#x003b2;-CD). Cyclodextrins
are cyclic carbohydrate molecules consisting of 1,4-&#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosides bound in a cone shape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> and are used primarily in food, pharmaceutical, and drug-delivery
applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Hydrophobic molecules can form
reversible inclusion complexes through hydrophobic and van der Waals
interactions (host&#x02013;guest chemistry) with the cyclodextrin cavity.
Tethering of &#x003b2;-CD on silicon dioxide surfaces,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> known as the molecular printboard,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> has been carried out by Reinhoudt and co-workers. This led to binding
control and characterizing binding strength of functionalized dendrimers,
nanoparticles, and fluorescent guest molecules with cyclodextrin inside
their hydrophobic cavity. In later work by Gonzalez-Campo et al.,
patterns of &#x003b2;-CD were created on glass surfaces through reactive
&#x003bc;CP, showcasing the possibility of fluorescent guest adsorption
from the solution to &#x003b2;-CD patterns or orthogonal supramolecular
printing of fluorescent guests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> The fluorescent
guest molecules in these cases contain two Ad moieties, which have
a high affinity for the &#x003b2;-CD cavity in water.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Furthermore, the reversibility and reusability of this
system has been tested by forming multivalent networks of &#x003b2;-CD-modified
gold nanoparticles with diferrocene-modified peptides, which functioned
as an ultrasensitive enzyme sensor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> In
order to test the immobilization via host&#x02013;guest interactions
with larger constructs than molecules, silica nanoparticles and quantum
dots have also been immobilized on &#x003b2;-CD surfaces using an intermediary
Ad-functionalized dendrimer as &#x0201c;glue&#x0201d;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> The high binding affinity of multivalent host&#x02013;guest interactions
has also been used for the adhesion of macroscopic acrylamide gels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Based on these examples, the versatility of
host&#x02013;guest interactions mediated by &#x003b2;-CD provides a reliable
tool for scaling up from nanoparticles to specific and reversible
immobilization of microparticles.</p><p>To study the supramolecular
adhesion of microparticles, we functionalized
PS particles with different amounts of Ad on their surface, patterned
glass surfaces with &#x003b2;-CD, and subsequently applied a flow of
functionalized particles over the modified glass surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a). PEG backfilling
is included as an antifouling layer between &#x003b2;-CD patterns. The
functionalized glass slides were placed in a holder which was connected
to a syringe pump for controlling the flow rate of PS particle solutions
over the glass slides. Host&#x02013;guest interactions between &#x003b2;-CD
and Ad allow for the capture of the functionalized PS particles on
the glass surface, which can then be analyzed via fluorescence microscopy. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b shows how the flow
cell holder setup is directly incorporated on the microscope to carry
out various flow experiments for characterizing binding of PS particles
to the &#x003b2;-CD-functionalized glass slide. Results regarding the
feasibility of this approach can also be used as a proof-of-concept
for the application in immobilizing similar-sized cells such as bacteria.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) Scheme

For acquiring an average particle density, all individual experiments

images in total). The pixels related to nonaggregated particles were
initially segmented out of the image using the &#x0201c;Analyze particles&#x0201d;

determined. With the &#x0201c;Measure&#x0201d; function, the pixels
were counted over the desired line patterns (on &#x003b2;-CD patterns
or PEG backfilling), which were then converted into amounts of particles
based on the determined average pixel size for one particle. The particle

the following formula<disp-formula id="ueq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="am9b11069_m001" position="anchor"/></disp-formula>Here, &#x003b7; (%) is the binding specificity,

the results and discussion, the terms &#x0201c;specificity&#x0201d;

of six Ad molecules per nm<sup>2</sup> was determined, which is unlikely
to reflect six Ad moieties in a densely packed 2D-surface configuration
because the effective size of Ad is ca. 0.41 nm<sup>2</sup> (based
on the reported Ad radius of 0.36 nm).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> This can be explained by the surface roughness of PS particles which
increases the total surface area compared to that of the model of
a smooth sphere used for carrying out all the calculations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> The high values for Ad surface loading can also
be explained by nonspecific uptake of Ad amine in the dispersion of

not specifically remove immobilized particles, indicating strong binding
interactions. Patterned binding of Ad-modified PS particles to the
&#x003b2;-CD-modified glass surface confirms that the binding affinity
is high enough to overcome the drag forces acting on the particles
(see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b11069/suppl_file/am9b11069_si_001.pdf">eq S1</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b11069/suppl_file/am9b11069_si_001.pdf">Table S3</ext-link>); the drag force acting on a microparticle for all flow
rates is approximately 10<sup>5</sup> times lower than the binding
strength of an individual Ad-&#x003b2;-CD host&#x02013;guest complex
(10<sup>&#x02013;11</sup> N).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> However,
this value for Ad-&#x003b2;-CD binding strength is based on ideal conditions,
not considering kinetic and concentration effects which are also important
for binding affinity and particle immobilization. Therefore, it is
still necessary to have multiple Ad-&#x003b2;-CD bonds for keeping particles
immobilized on the surfaces during flow.</p><p>The influence of the
flow rate on particle capturing was studied
by varying the flow rate from 0.125 to 200 &#x003bc;L/min. Subsequently,
the different flow rates were compared both on the density of captured
particles and on specificity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b11069/suppl_file/am9b11069_si_001.pdf">S9</ext-link>). The values for
particle binding density and specificity of PS-Cy5.5-0.8Ad particles
for the printed &#x003b2;-CD lines on the glass surface were calculated
and plotted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b,c. Looking at the particle binding density graph in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b and microscope images [<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a (i&#x02013;iv)],
increasing the flow rate from 2.5 &#x003bc;L/min until 200 &#x003bc;L/min
resulted in a decrease of immobilized particles from 3 to 0.5 PS-Cy5.5-0.8Ad
particles/10<sup>2</sup> &#x003bc;m on &#x003b2;-CD. This finding is in
line with the literature as particle deposition increases with lower
flow rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup></p><p>Another important factor
for assessing the immobilization of particles
to modified surfaces is the particle binding specificity. The particle
binding specificity, in this case, measures how well PS-Cy5.5-0.8Ad
particles bind specifically to the patterns of &#x003b2;-CD compared
to the aspecific binding to PEG backfilling and is plotted in (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c). From a flow rate
of 2.5 &#x003bc;L/min and above, samples have a binding specificity
of &#x02265;80% for &#x003b2;-CD lines and with flow rates from 5 &#x003bc;L/min
and above, samples have the highest specificities above 90%. Using
a flow rate of 0.125 and 0.25 &#x003bc;L/min resulted in a lower binding
specificity most significantly compared to the other flow rates, which
is mostly because of the lower particle binding density. The amount
of particles captured on the functionalized surfaces at flow rates
from 10 &#x003bc;L/min and above is considerably lower than that with
2.5 and 5 &#x003bc;L/min flow rates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b). Thus, a flow rate of 5 &#x003bc;L/min for
specific immobilization of these particles is most desirable, considering
the particle binding density and specificity.</p><p>Surprisingly,
when we carried out particle-capturing experiments
at extremely low flow rates of 0.125 and 0.25 &#x003bc;L/min, almost
no particles were bound to the printed &#x003b2;-CD surface. Comsol
particle flow simulations were carried out to investigate the change
in particle binding to the &#x003b2;-CD-modified surface with flow rates.
These calculations were made using a 2D flow cell geometry of 20 mm
in length and 0.3 mm in height that represented the conditions in
the Micronit flow channel, 1 &#x003bc;m sized particles, similar flow
rates, and stick conditions for both the bottom and top channel walls
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b11069/suppl_file/am9b11069_si_001.pdf">Figure S3c</ext-link>). After carrying out simulations
at different flow rates, particles were counted over the center of
the bottom channel wall from 5 to 15 mm for each simulation, which
is approximately where the glass surface in the practical experiments
was patterned with &#x003b2;-CD through &#x003bc;CP. Indeed, a similar
trend in particle binding density to the practical flow experiments
was noticed in the Comsol particle tracing data, when we focused on
this area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a&#x02013;i), marked with a red line. It is also clear that the flow
profile of trajectory graphs (a&#x02013;d) (0.0625&#x02013;1.25 &#x003bc;L/min
flow rate) is mostly based on diffusion and settling of particles,
while in trajectory graphs (e,f) (2.5&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;L/min flow
rate), a laminar flow profile is observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). In trajectory graphs (a) and (b) from <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>, the particles stuck
to the marked area on the bottom channel wall decreases dramatically
because particles settle before they reach the designated area. The
trend seen in the graph in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>j correlates well with the experimental findings for
the practical experiments in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>. Therefore, a decrease is observed in particle binding
density because of the particle settling before reaching the functionalized
area with &#x003b2;-CD patterns in the middle of the channel. This was
confirmed by carrying out a flow experiment at 0.125 &#x003bc;L/min
with only the PS-Cy3 particle on PEG-functionalized glass surfaces,
which shows that most particles are situated in the inlet side of
the flow channel after flow incubation (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b11069/suppl_file/am9b11069_si_001.pdf">Figure S10</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Comsol particle tracing data of flow rates (a) 0.0625,

regime (between flow rates of 2.5 and 200 &#x003bc;L/min), the particle
binding density also decreases within the practical experiments and
simulation because the effect of gravity and diffusion is low. The
effect of diffusion can be explained using the P&#x000e9;clet (<italic>Pe</italic>) number, which describes the effect of flow advection
compared to that of particle diffusion. As mentioned above, we assume
the laminar flow within the microfluidic channel at flow rates 2.5&#x02013;200
&#x003bc;L/min, which means that the particle velocity decreases close
to the channel walls (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b11069/suppl_file/am9b11069_si_001.pdf">eq S2</ext-link>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b11069/suppl_file/am9b11069_si_001.pdf">Table S4</ext-link>).

For flow rates of 100 and 200 &#x003bc;L/min, the <italic>Pe</italic> numbers were considerably higher than 1, which explains the small
difference in particle binding density. This is caused by a limitation
in the amount of particles that can reach the bottom channel through
diffusion or settling, while at flow rates from 2.5 to 10 &#x003bc;L/min,
particle diffusion to the channel wall is possible from a larger distance
(<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b11069/suppl_file/am9b11069_si_001.pdf">Figures S11 and S12</ext-link>). Therefore, there
is a specific range of flow rates in which the increased effect of
diffusion combined with advection allows for more Ad-functionalized
PS particles to come in contact with the area patterned with &#x003b2;-CD
and thus be immobilized.</p><p>For nonfunctionalized PS-Cy3 particles,
significantly lower binding,
ranging from 0.008 to 0.04 particles per 100 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> (for
flow rates 2.5&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;L/min), was observed (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b11069/suppl_file/am9b11069_si_001.pdf">Figure S13</ext-link>). The amount of PS-Cy3 particles,
however, increases when higher amounts PS-Cy5.5-Ad particles were
immobilized on the surface, which could be caused by aggregation of
PS-Cy3 particles with PS-Cy5.5-Ad particles. An experiment with only
PS-Cy3 particles carried out as a control at 5 &#x003bc;L/min flow showed
that almost no particles were bound to the glass surface (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsami.9b11069/suppl_file/am9b11069_si_001.pdf">Figure S14</ext-link>).</p><p>To study the effect of particle
settling on PS-Cy5.5-0.8Ad particle
binding to the functionalized surface, an upside down flow experiment
at 2.5 and 5 &#x003bc;L/min was carried out by turning the flow cell
holder upside down (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). These flow rates were chosen because the transition to
laminar flow occurs at 2.5 and 5 &#x003bc;L/min, according to the particle
trajectories in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>. As observed in the microscopic images (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a), PS particle binding to &#x003b2;-CD patterns
is still possible in upside down flow situations and was selective
for PS-Cy5.5-0.8Ad particles. Compared to the upright flow experiment
(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b), binding
to the surface was &#x0223c;six times lower for 2.5 &#x003bc;L/min at
0.4 particles per 100 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> and &#x0223c;three times
lower for 5 &#x003bc;L/min at 0.8 particles per 100 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> on &#x003b2;-CD patterns (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b). Therefore, particle settling has a significant
effect in improving the contact of the PS particles with the bottom
channel wall. Nevertheless, PS-Cy5.5-0.8Ad particle binding to &#x003b2;-CD
patterns is still feasible and specific through host&#x02013;guest
interactions without the aid of particle settling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>c).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>(a) Fluorescence microscope

100 times lower than PS-Cy5.5-Ad density on cyclodextrin. PS-Cy5.5-Ad

amount of Ad and &#x003b2;-CD pairs that are
interacting to immobilize one Ad-functionalized PS particle, the accessible
contact area of PS and &#x003b2;-CD was calculated to be ca. 2000 nm<sup>2</sup>, when a PS particle touches the glass surface (based on an
Ad-NH<sub>2</sub> linker length of 0.6 nm). Assuming the Ad loading
previously determined, the amount of Ad moieties present on the PS
particle surface within the 2000 nm<sup>2</sup> contact area is approximately
2000 for PS-Cy5.5-0.15Ad, 4000 for PS-Cy5.5-0.3Ad, and 12&#x02009;000
for PS-Cy5.5-0.8Ad. When assuming a &#x003b2;-CD surface density of
6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;11</sup> mol/cm<sup>2</sup> on glass from
the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> ca. 800 &#x003b2;-CD units
are present in 2000 nm<sup>2</sup> on glass. Interestingly, &#x003b2;-CD-Ad
couples are therefore limited by the number of &#x003b2;-CD molecules
rather than that of Ad. However, as mentioned before, in the characterization
of the PS particles, actual Ad loading on the PS surface is most likely
lower than the amounts calculated via NMR analysis. More importantly,
the surface roughness of PS particles and glass can also reduce the
amount of accessible Ad and &#x003b2;-CD molecules for host&#x02013;guest
interactions. Furthermore, the binding affinity is also governed by
concentration gradients within a solution and kinetic effects, which
increases the complexity in determining the amount of interactions
required for microparticle immobilization to a surface. Therefore,
we argue that these experimental findings and analyses show that determining
the amount of interactions required for microparticle immobilization
is not straightforward and requires further research. Nevertheless,
these results do show that changing the relative amount of targeting
molecules on the microparticle surface, thereby tuning the multivalency,
plays an important role for increasing microparticle immobilization
on functionalized surfaces.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><label>3.4</label><title>Reversibility and Reusability

Glass Surfaces</title><p>The reversible nature of particle immobilization
mediated by host&#x02013;guest interactions was tested by removal of
particles and re-addition of &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; particles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>). The addition of
the PS particle mix (PS-Cy5.5-0.8Ad and PS-Cy3) at 5 &#x003bc;L/min
was carried out over the &#x003b2;-CD surfaces as before, and the surface
was analyzed on the microscope. Rinsing with EtOH was attempted to
diminish the hydrophobic interaction between &#x003b2;-CD and Ad.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> In addition, rinsing with a concentrated solution
of &#x003b2;-CD was performed to compete in the host&#x02013;guest interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> Unfortunately, both approaches did not result
in significant release of the multivalently bound microparticles.
Next, a more rigorous ultrasonic treatment in EtOH and subsequently
water was applied. It is observed in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>a that complete removal of PS particles was
achieved and the glass surface is still functional for the subsequent

particle immobilization experiments shows that two times less PS-Cy5.5-Ad
particles are immobilized the second time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>b). This could be due to loss of &#x003b2;-CD
functionality through ultrasonic treatment or because some EtOH is
still present on the glass substrate that can diminish binding affinity
of Ad for the &#x003b2;-CD cavity.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>(a) Fluorescence microscope images of

glass platform has been developed
that can capture micrometer-sized particles on flow in a recyclable
manner. The capture of &#x0201c;large&#x0201d; particles, about 10<sup>3</sup> times larger than the host molecule &#x003b2;-CD, was possible
through multivalent host&#x02013;guest interactions between Ad and
cyclodextrin. Immobilization of Ad-functionalized PS particles to
&#x003b2;-CD-modified platforms was flow rate-dependent, with an optimal
capturing density at 2.5&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;L/min. Changing the degree
of Ad functionalization on the PS particles influenced the degree
of binding on the glass surfaces, underpinning the effect of multivalent
host&#x02013;guest interactions on particle binding. The modified glass
platforms could also be recycled, highlighting the potential of using
such systems in water purification setups. The depicted results of
this model system show that host&#x02013;guest interactions can bridge
the gap between the nano- and microscale and also give insight into
certain parameters and hurdles that are important to be taken into
account for approaching the application of bacterial cell targeting
in wastewater. Moreover, the experimental setup of this model system
can be easily used for immobilization tests with different types of
molecules or particles.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information is
