the folding kinetics of which are essential for their functions, such as in the
maintenance of genome stability and the protection of chromosome ends. In the
present study, we investigated the folding kinetics of G-quadruplex in different
monovalent cation environments and determined the detailed kinetic parameters
for Na<sup>+</sup>- and K<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex folding, and for its
structural transition from the basket-type Na<sup>+</sup> form to the
hybrid-type K<sup>+</sup> form. More interestingly, although Li<sup>+</sup> was
often used in previous studies of G-quadruplex folding as a control ion supposed
to have no effect, we have found that Li<sup>+</sup> can actually influence the
folding kinetics of both Na<sup>+</sup>- and K<sup>+</sup>-induced
G-quadruplexes significantly and in different ways, by changing the folding
fraction of Na<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplexes and greatly increasing the
folding rates of K<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplexes. The present study may
shed new light on the roles of monovalent cations in G-quadruplex folding and
should be useful for further studies of the underlying folding mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>G-quadruplex</kwd><kwd>monovalent cations</kwd><kwd>folding kinetics</kwd><kwd>stopped-flow</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Telomeres are structural regions composed of DNA and proteins at the ends of linear
chromosomes in eukaryotic cells, playing significant roles in protecting the
chromosome ends from deterioration, as well as protecting cells from aging [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Human telomeric DNA is consisted of tandem
TTAGGG repeats, which can fold into compact G-quadruplex structures by Hoogsteen
hydrogen bonds with four guanines forming a planar tetrad and three tetrads stacking
further [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. G-quadruplex structures have
attracted great attention because of their physiological significance on telomeric
regulation and maintenance [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and their
potentials as the target of anti-cancer drugs, such as platinum drugs [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>There are several types of G-quadruplex structures formed by human telomeric repeats,
such as parallel [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], antiparallel basket
[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], antiparallel chair [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], (2+2) antiparallel [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], hybrid-1 [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], hybrid-2 [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and 2-tetrad basket [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
The structure of G-quadruplexes not only depends on the DNA sequence [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but also is affected by the ionic
environments. In the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, G-quadruplex DNA
(AGGG(TTAGGG)<sub>3</sub>) has been reported to fold predominantly in an
antiparallel basket-type structure, with a 265-nm negative peak and a 290-nm
positive peak as the characteristic peaks in its circular dichroism (CD) spectra
[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the presence of K<sup>+</sup>,
G-quadruplex DNA mainly folds into hybrid structures, with a 235-nm negative peak
and, 260- and 290-nm positive peaks [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It
should be noted that, although great efforts have been made on the folding kinetics
and pathways of G-quadruplexes, the detailed mechanism still remains elusive and
controversial. For example, previous studies suggested that G-quadruplex folding
undergoes a simple sequential pathway, involving up to two intermediate states
[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], whereas more
recent studies proposed the occurrence of more complex multi-pathway folding
processes [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Owing to the polymorphism and complexity of G-quadruplex
structures, further studies are needed on the folding kinetics of G-quadruplexes and
on the effects of cations involved therein.</p><p>In addition, since Li<sup>+</sup> is regarded as a monovalent cation having no effect
on G-quadruplex folding, it has been commonly used in control experiments for
studying G-quadruplexes [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, until now
there is actually no careful study about the influence of Li<sup>+</sup> on
G-quadruplex folding processes.</p><p>Here, by using stopped-flow fluorescence method, we investigated the folding kinetics
of G-quadruplexes with human telomeric repeats in different monovalent cation
environments. We not only carried out folding kinetic assays in both Na<sup>+</sup>
and K<sup>+</sup> environments, but also studied the kinetics of conformational
transition from Na<sup>+</sup>- to K<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex structures.
Furthermore, we studied the effects of Li<sup>+</sup> on the G-quadruplex folding
kinetics in Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> environments. Surprisingly, we found
that Li<sup>+</sup> influences the folding fraction of Na<sup>+</sup>-induced
G-quadruplexes, and greatly increases the folding rates of K<sup>+</sup>-induced
G-quadruplexes. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of G-quadruplex
folding kinetics in different monovalent cation environments and may be helpful for
further <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of
G-quadruplex structures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>DNA sequence and sample preparation</title><p>The G-quadruplex DNA sequence is A(GGGTTA)<sub>3</sub>GGG, which is a snippet of
human telomere repeat motifs. In our stopped-flow assays, fluorescent label
carboxyfluorescein (FAM) was attached to the 3&#x02032; end and Hex
(hexachlorofluorescein) to the 5&#x02032; end of the G-quadruplex DNA sequence.
G-quadruplex DNA, with or without fluorescent labels, was purchased from
Invitrogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Shanghai, China), and diluted to 100
&#x003bc;M with an annealing buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) for using.
All chemicals were reagent grade and were obtained from Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich
(Shanghai, China).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Stopped-flow kinetics study</title><p>All the stopped-flow kinetic assays were carried out using a Bio-Logic SFM-400
mixer with a 1.5 &#x000d7; 1.5 mm quartz cell. The Bio-Logic MOS450/AF-CD
optical system (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, France) was equipped with a 150-W
mercury-xenon lamp.</p><p>In the G-quadruplex folding kinetic assay, when the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
is folded into a G-quadruplex structure, the distance between FAM and Hex will
decrease by several nanometers, enhancing the efficiency of fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the two dye molecules. The fluorescent
label FAM (donor) was excited at 492 nm (2-nm bandwidth) and its emission signal
was monitored at 525 nm using a high pass filter with 20-nm bandwidth
(D525/20, Chroma Technology Co., U.S.A.). All the measurements were
carried out at room temperature (23&#x000b0;C).</p><p>To measure the folding kinetic of DNA, the reacting reagents (DNA and monovalent
cations) were separately dissolved in Tris/HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in
two different syringes, and the reaction was initiated by the rapid mixing of
them. There were 20 nM G-quadruplex DNA and varying concentrations of ions in
the final reaction solution. All concentrations mentioned in the present study
were after mixing. The kinetic folding curves represented averages of over five
individual traces, then were analyzed using Bio-Kine (version 4.26, Bio-Logic)
with double- or triple-exponential functions for those with two or three folding
phases respectively. In the Na<sup>+</sup> form to K<sup>+</sup> form transition
assay, the G-quadruplex DNA was diluted in 100 mM NaCl solution and annealed
overnight (heated to 92&#x000b0;C for 2 min and cooled slowly to the room
temperature), and then reacted with K<sup>+</sup> of different concentrations.
In the Li<sup>+</sup>-related assays, Li<sup>+</sup> and the other cation
(Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>) were premixed adequately, then mixed with
the G-quadruplex DNA to initiate the folding process.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Circular dichroism spectrum measurements</title><p>CD spectrum measurements were performed on the Bio-Logic MOS450/AF-CD

For each measurement, 1.5 ml of solution with 1 &#x003bc;M G-quadruplex DNA was
contained in a quartz cell of 1-cm optical path length. The measurements were
recorded at each nanometer from 220 to 320 nm at room temperature. Each spectrum

ssDNA molecules fold into G-quadruplex structures, the distance between the
donor and acceptor would decrease, leading to increasing of the FRET efficiency.
Accordingly, the fluorescence intensity of donor FAM would decrease and that of
acceptor Hex would increase simultaneously (Supplementary Figure S1). In the
following, we only monitored the fluorescence intensity of FAM for studying the
G-quadruplex folding processes.</p><p>The G-quadruplex folding kinetic curves thus obtained were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
B. We found that these data curves can be well fitted by a double-exponential
decay, suggesting that two phases are involved in the G-quadruplex folding
process (see below). We used the decrease in fluorescence intensity or the
folding amplitude to indicate the fraction of ssDNA that folded into the
G-quadruplex structure.</p><p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> C, the folding
amplitude of the fast phase increases with increasing Na<sup>+</sup>
concentration and is almost saturated at 150 mM Na<sup>+</sup>, while that of
the slow phase increases first with increasing Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and
then starts to decrease when the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration is above 75 mM.
The total amplitude increases with increasing Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and
is saturated at 100 mM Na<sup>+</sup> (<italic>A</italic><sub>total</sub>
= 0.265 &#x000b1; 0.002), indicating that the fraction of DNA having
folded into G-quadruplexes reaches the maximum at this Na<sup>+</sup>
concentration.</p><p>Similarly, the folding rate of the fast phase also increases, almost in a linear
way, with increasing Na<sup>+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). At 100 mM Na<sup>+</sup>, which is close to the
physiological concentration and used commonly in other studies, the rate
constant is <italic>k</italic><sub>fast</sub> = 1.63 &#x000b1; 0.02
s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. In contrast, the folding rate of the slow phase
remains almost constant and <italic>k</italic><sub>slow</sub> = 0.26
&#x000b1; 0.01 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 100 mM Na<sup>+</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>G-quadruplex folding kinetics in K<sup>+</sup> environment</title><p>In the presence of K<sup>+</sup>, the negative peak at 235 nm and two positive
peaks at 260 and 290 nm of the CD spectrum indicate the folding of the ssDNA
into the hybrid G-quadruplex structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2</xref>A), consistent with previous results [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There are two common hybrid G-quadruplex structures
coexisting in K<sup>+</sup> environment, hybrid-1 and hybrid-2, which could not
be distinguished by CD spectra [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
However, the hybrid-1 structure was identified as being thermodynamically
favored [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which may be the major structure in our experiment.
The schematic view of the hybrid-1 structure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> (A, inset).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Effect of K<sup>+</sup> on G-quadruplex folding kinetics</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CD spectra of G-quadruplexes in 100 mM KCl buffer.

experiments. The fast decrease in the fluorescence intensity of FAM shows that
the ssDNA molecules folded more quickly in K<sup>+</sup> environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The G-quadruplex folding kinetic
curves can also be well fitted by a double-exponential decay. The overall trends
of the data curves for the folding amplitude and rate are similar to that in the
above Na<sup>+</sup> case, but two main differences between the Na<sup>+</sup>
and K<sup>+</sup> experiments may be noticed.</p><p>First, the total amplitude is saturated at 50 mM K<sup>+</sup> with a greater
value of <italic>A</italic><sub>total</sub> (0.482 &#x000b1; 0.002) than that for
Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), suggesting
that more ssDNA were folded into G-quadruplex structures in the presence of
K<sup>+</sup>. This is consistent with previous single-molecule FRET
experiments showing that almost all the DNA molecules were folded into
G-quadruplex structures in K<sup>+</sup> environment, whereas part of the DNA
molecules was still unfolded in Na<sup>+</sup> environment [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Note that the FRET efficiency is
higher in the hybrid structure, as the distance between the donor and the
acceptor is smaller than that in the antiparallel basket-type structure [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This might also contribute to the greater amplitudes in
K<sup>+</sup> environment.</p><p>Second, the folding in K<sup>+</sup> environment was more rapid than that in
Na<sup>+</sup> environment. At 100 mM K<sup>+</sup>, the folding rates are
<italic>k</italic><sub>fast</sub> = 4.94 &#x000b1; 0.03
s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and <italic>k</italic><sub>slow</sub> = 0.66
&#x000b1; 0.01 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2</xref>D). This suggests that K<sup>+</sup> not only makes G-quadruplex
structures more stable than Na<sup>+</sup>, but also has greater effect on the
folding kinetics than Na<sup>+</sup> at a given concentration.</p><p>Here, it should be mentioned that two phases were detected in both
Na<sup>+</sup>- and K<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex folding kinetics. In
recent studies that focused on the kinetic partitioning mechanism of
G-quadruplex folding processes [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], it is indicated that unfolded ssDNA
favors folding rapidly into multiple G-quadruplex structures, and then undergoes
conformational reorganization to the final thermodynamically stable state. The
two phases we observed may correspond to the above two processes and the
kinetics parameters we obtained be the result of multiple reactions. This will
be discussed later (see the first subsection of Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Transition kinetics of G-quadruplex structures from Na<sup>+</sup> form to
K<sup>+</sup> form</title><p>Previous studies revealed that the K<sup>+</sup> ion could replace the
Na<sup>+</sup> ion inside a basket-type G-quadruplex structure and convert
it to a hybrid-type form, whereas the opposite is not true, i.e. Na<sup>+</sup>
could not replace K<sup>+</sup> inside a hybrid-type G-quadruplex structure and
convert it to a basket-type form [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To further investigate the difference between Na<sup>+</sup> and
K<sup>+</sup> on the G-quadruplex folding, we measured the transition
kinetics of G-quadruplex structures from the Na<sup>+</sup> form to the
K<sup>+</sup> form.</p><p>First, G-quadruplex ssDNA was annealed overnight in the annealing buffer

intensity right after the rapid mixing of the above DNA solution with KCl at
different concentrations. The kinetic time-courses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A. Different from the above kinetic
data in the Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> experiments, the kinetic time
courses for Na<sup>+</sup>&#x02212;K<sup>+</sup> transition are best fitted by a
triple-exponential function, with one fast phase and two slow phases (designated
as slow1 and slow2). As can be seen from the comparison in Supplementary Figure
S2, the double-exponential fitting cannot describe the data well in the first
second of the kinetic curve.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Transition kinetics of G-quadruplex structures from Na<sup>+</sup>

the total amplitude in the Na<sup>+</sup>&#x02013;K<sup>+</sup> transition assay
(0.22 at 100 mM K<sup>+</sup>) is just coincident with the difference between
the folding amplitude in 100 mM K<sup>+</sup> environment (0.48, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C) and that in 100 mM Na<sup>+</sup>
environment (0.265, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).</p><p>To figure out what the three phases represent, we performed control experiments
by adding 40% w/v PEG200 into the 100 mM Na<sup>+</sup> solution
of G-quadruplex, to both provide the crowded environment and stabilize the
folded G-quadruplex structures [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], prior to the Na<sup>+</sup>&#x02212;K<sup>+</sup> transition
measurement. In this case, we found that the donor&#x02019;s fluorescence
intensity decreased slowly with time. Here, the fast phase disappeared and a
double-exponential decay was sufficient to fit these intensity curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). The corresponding folding
amplitudes and rates thus obtained are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> E and F.</p><p>For the fast phase, as there are still unfolded ssDNA molecules in 100 mM
Na<sup>+</sup> environment (comparing the total folding amplitudes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>C and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C) and almost all the ssDNA would fold in K<sup>+</sup>
environment [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the fast phase we
observed in the Na<sup>+</sup>&#x02212;K<sup>+</sup> transition experiment
without PEG200 should correspond to a K<sup>+</sup>-induced folding of the
previously unfolded ssDNA into G-quadruplex structure. When adding PEG200, the
crowded environment would tend to compact the ssDNA molecules, promoting most
unfolded ssDNA to fold into G-quadruplexes in the Na<sup>+</sup> environment, as
demonstrated by the increased characteristic peak values at 265 and 290 nm in CD
spectra in previous studies [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The phenomenon was also observed in
our experiment (Supplementary Figure S3). Therefore, the fast phase was then
eliminated in the Na<sup>+</sup>&#x02212;K<sup>+</sup> transition experiment
because, in the presence of PEG200, there was no longer unfolded ssDNA in the
Na<sup>+</sup> solution. Note that the folding rate of the fast phase in the
Na<sup>+</sup>&#x02212;K<sup>+</sup> transition assay (6.97
s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 100 mM K<sup>+</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) is comparable with that in K<sup>+</sup> environment
(4.94 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 100 mM K<sup>+</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D), further indicating that the fast phase observed
in the Na<sup>+</sup>&#x02212;K<sup>+</sup> transition experiment corresponds to
K<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex folding.</p><p>The two slow phases of the decreasing fluorescence intensity may represent two
phases in the conversion process of the G-quadruplex structures from the
Na<sup>+</sup> form to K<sup>+</sup> form. The amplitudes and rates of the
slow phases were also reduced by the crowded environment provided by PEG200
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> E and F). It should be
mentioned that PEG200 was reported to convert the K<sup>+</sup>-induced
G-quadruplex structure from the hybrid-type to the parallel-type [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This conformational change results
from the fact that PEG200 might specifically bind to the parallel-type
K<sup>+</sup>-induced structure, rather than from the environment crowding
[<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but this conformational change
is a quite slow (hours-long) process [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
Thus our measurements recorded within 100 s should mainly involve the conversion
from the Na<sup>+</sup>-induced basket-type structure to the
K<sup>+</sup>-induced hybrid-type structure in the crowded environment.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>G-quadruplex folding kinetics in Li<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>

mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Then, we repeated the

Na<sup>+</sup> only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), but
interestingly, we noticed that the situation is not so simple at a given
concentration of Na<sup>+</sup>. When the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> is low
(10 mM), the folding amplitude increases with increasing Li<sup>+</sup>
concentration. However, when the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> is high
(&#x0003e;30 mM), the folding amplitude becomes decreasing with increasing
Li<sup>+</sup> concentration. These results indicate that not only
Li<sup>+</sup> can influence the Na<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex
folding, but also the underlying mechanism may be complicated, which are
inconsistent with our previous knowledge that Li<sup>+</sup> has no effect on
G-quadruplex folding.</p><p>We think Li<sup>+</sup> may influence the Na<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex
folding in two ways. On the one hand, Li<sup>+</sup> could have non-specific
interactions with the phosphate groups of the DNA to cause DNA condensation
[<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], contributing to the
Na<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex folding. On the other hand,
Li<sup>+</sup> could compete with Na<sup>+</sup> by forming other structures
different from G-quadruplexes, such as transient G-tetramers [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] or G-quartet with twisted G-quartet
plates [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Since Na<sup>+</sup>-induced
G-quadruplexes are not stable and may dynamically switch between the folding and
unfolding states [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], Li<sup>+</sup> may
replace Na<sup>+</sup> in the unfolded state, resulting in the formation of some
other structures and thus reducing the fraction of Na<sup>+</sup>-induced
G-quadruplex structure. In light of these observations, our observed phenomenon
might be explained as follows.</p><p>When the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> is low (e.g. 10 mM), the fraction of
Na<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplexes is very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), the condensation effect of Li<sup>+</sup> on
ssDNA is dominant, and the competitive effect of Li<sup>+</sup> is not obvious
since only few G-quadruplexes form. Thus, Li<sup>+</sup> tends to enhance
G-quadruplex folding and the folding amplitude increases with increasing
Li<sup>+</sup> concentration. On the contrary, when the concentration of
Na<sup>+</sup> is high, there are more formed G-quadruplexes. The effect of
Li<sup>+</sup>-induced DNA condensation on G-quadruplex folding becomes
unimportant (or redundant), whereas the competition effect of Li<sup>+</sup>
with Na<sup>+</sup> becomes more obvious because more Na<sup>+</sup>-induced
G-quadruplexes could act as the target of Li<sup>+</sup>. Thus as the
Li<sup>+</sup> concentration increases, the folding amplitude is
decreased.</p><p>In addition to the folding amplitude, the folding rate of Na<sup>+</sup>-induced
G-quadruplexes are also influenced by Li<sup>+</sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, the folding rate of the fast phase
is generally enhanced by Li<sup>+</sup> for a given Na<sup>+</sup> environment.
Enhancement as high as 4 folds may be observed.</p><p>It should be noted that another possible reason for the increased folding
fraction of Na<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplexes may be the structural change
of G-quadruplexes caused by Li<sup>+</sup>, but our measurements of the CD
spectra excluded this possibility. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, the CD spectrum of the G-quadruplex DNA in 100 mM LiCl
and 100 mM NaCl environment is very similar to that in only 100 mM NaCl
environment. The positions of the 265 and 290 nm characteristic peaks are the
same, and the CD values of the peaks are slightly reduced when adding
Li<sup>+</sup>, demonstrating that Li<sup>+</sup> does not change the
Na<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex structure but only decrease its folding
fraction. Interestingly, we also measured the CD spectra of the ssDNA in a
buffer without any monovalent cations or in only 100 mM LiCl environment, and
found that the two spectra were quite different. This indicates that
Li<sup>+</sup> alone may indeed induce the ssDNA to form some minor
structures, i.e. transient G-tetramers.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>G-quadruplex folding kinetics in Li<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>

almost independent of Li<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure
5</xref>C), which is quite different from the observations in the above case
of Li<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>. This phenomenon can be explained as
follows: (i) K<sup>+</sup> is powerful to induce G-quadruplex folding even at 10
mM concentration, thus the condensation effect of Li<sup>+</sup> on G-quadruplex
folding is unimportant for the folding fraction; and (ii) K<sup>+</sup>-induced
G-quadruplexes are of great stability compared with Na<sup>+</sup>-induced ones
[<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which was also demonstrated in
the above Na<sup>+</sup>&#x02212;K<sup>+</sup> transition results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), so Li<sup>+</sup> cannot compete
with K<sup>+</sup> by forming other structures different from
G-quadruplexes.</p><p>Note that although Li<sup>+</sup> has negligible effect on the folding fraction
of K<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplexes, Li<sup>+</sup> enhances the folding
rates of K<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplexes. This should be attributed to the
DNA condensation effect of Li<sup>+</sup>. In other words, the electropositive
property of Li<sup>+</sup> could neutralize the electrostatic repulsion of DNA
and make it more flexible to fold [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].
The rate of the fast phase of K<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex folding is
increased by nearly eight times in the presence of Li<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D), more notable than in the case of
Na<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex folding. We believe one reason is that
the competitive effect of Li<sup>+</sup> takes effect in the latter case.
Interestingly, by careful checking of the fast folding rates in different
K<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup> concentrations, we found that they are
similar as long as the total ionic concentrations remain the same. As an
example, the fast folding rate is 8.43 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 150 mM
K<sup>+</sup>, 11.61 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 100 mM K<sup>+</sup> and 50 mM
Li<sup>+</sup>, and 9.33 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 50 mM K<sup>+</sup> and
100 mM Li<sup>+</sup>. This indicates that the ionic strength plays a key role
in the folding kinetics of G-quadruplexes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Studies of the effects of monovalent cations on folding kinetics of G-quadruplexes

(Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup>) on G-quadruplex folding
kinetics of the telomeric DNA sequence. The results are summarized as follows: (i)
Both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> can induce G-quadruplex folding, but there is

almost no unfolded ssDNA in only 50 mM K<sup>+</sup> environment; (ii) K<sup>+</sup>

with previous studies [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; (iii) For
Na<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex folding, Li<sup>+</sup> can cooperate with
Na<sup>+</sup> to promote the folding at low Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations, but
compete with Na<sup>+</sup> to reduce the folding fractions at high Na<sup>+</sup>

Li<sup>+</sup>; and (iv) For K<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex folding,

promotes the folding rates.</p><sec id="sec4-1"><title>Reorganization in Na<sup>+</sup>- and K<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplex
folding</title><p>In both Na<sup>+</sup>- and K<sup>+</sup>-induced folding kinetics, a fast and a
slow phase were detected. The fast phase may be attributed to the rapid folding
of unfolded DNA into different intermediate conformational states, and the slow
phase to the reorganization of these conformational states to reach the
thermodynamic equilibrium, where there maybe exist, depending on the sequence of
ssDNA and the buffer conditions, one or several G-quadruplex structures. For
example, a 22-nt human telomeric sequence (Tel22) forms a single stable
basket-type G-quadruplex in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> and a mixture of
multiple G-quadruplex conformations in the presence of K<sup>+</sup>; however, a
26-nt human telomeric sequence (Tel26) does not form a well-defined unique
G-quadruplex structure in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, but it forms a single
stable hybrid-1 G-quadruplex in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Multiple intermediate states during G-quadruplex folding processes have been
observed in many studies. In Na<sup>+</sup> environment, it was observed that
there are multiple G-quadruplex structures, such as antiparallel chair, (2+2)
antiparallel and 2-tetra basket states, existing and interconverting even in
high-concentration (up to 400 mM) NaCl solutions [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In another study, most intermediates were observed to
switch into the antiparallel-basket type G-quadruplex structure, which is the
most stable, in the final equilibrium state [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In K<sup>+</sup> environment, more studies on the kinetic partitioning mechanism
of G-quadruplex folding kinetics have demonstrated the existence of multiple
G-quadruplex intermediates. Bessi et al. [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] have showed that the folding of Tel24 undergoes kinetic
partitioning, and three types of structures are populated: hybrid-1, hybrid-2,
and partially unfolded structures. The formation of the less stable hybrid-2
structure is kinetically favored. Refolding of the hybrid-2 structure involves
extensive reorganization of the G-quadruplex to the more stable hybrid-1
structure via partially unfolded structures [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Marchand and Gabelica [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> ] have proposed that the unfolded G-quadruplex DNA may quickly
misfold into antiparallel basket structure and then reorganize to hybrid
structures. And Aznauryan et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have described a complex multi-pathway process of
G-quadruplex folding that involves numerous folding/unfolding transitions
and an extensive redistribution between several conformational states.
Similarly, several molecular dynamics simulation studies also proposed that
kinetically favored structures would form first and then transform into the more
stable hybrid-1 structure [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All these
studies suggested that the G-quadruplex ssDNA would first undergo the
kinetically favored folding to form intermediate structures such as
antiparallel, hybrid-2, or 2-tetrad G-quadruplex, and then these intermediate
structures would reorganize to the final hybrid-1 structure in K<sup>+</sup>
environment.</p><p>Note that, Zhang and Balasubramanian [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]
reported that the rapid folding of G-quadruplex was within 0.15 s, and Aznauryan
et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] identified
the folding intermediates persisted 1&#x02013;2 s. In our 100 mM K<sup>+</sup>
environment, the reaction time of the fast phase is
1/<italic>k</italic><sub>fast</sub> = 0.20 s and that of the
slow phase is 1/<italic>k</italic><sub>slow</sub> = 1.51 s, which
are consistent with the above reports. Moreover, with the increase in the
K<sup>+</sup> concentration, more hybrid-1 structures form directly from
unfolded DNA, and the other intermediates become more unstable [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], so the folding amplitude would become
lower and the folding rate higher for the slow phase, which are just what we
observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C and D). As shown in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C,
<italic>A</italic><sub>slow</sub> is equal to zero in 10 and 30 mM NaCl
environments, i.e. there exists only one phase at low NaCl concentrations. We
think the reason may be that, at low Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations, the effect
of Na<sup>+</sup> on the G-quadruplex conformation is weak and thus there are no
thermodynamically favored G-quadruplex structures other than the kinetically
favored intermediate structures, therefore further conformational reorganization
of the intermediate structures no longer occurs. In other words, these
intermediate structures are essentially in equilibrium once they are formed.</p><p>It should be mentioned that, although G-hairpin [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and G-triplex [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were
also supposed to be intermediate structures involved in the G-quadruplex folding
process, these two structures could only exist within microseconds or
milliseconds [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], beyond the temporal resolution of our measurements.
Therefore, what we had mainly detected here should be the relatively long-lived
intermediate states, the lifetimes of which were reported to be in seconds
previously [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, as our
kinetic measurements were performed only within tens of seconds, the final state
in our measurements might not be the most stable state of the folded
G-quadruplex structures.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2"><title>Conformational transition from Na<sup>+</sup>- to K<sup>+</sup>-induced
G-quadruplex structures occurs in two slow phases</title><p>In the conformational transition kinetic assay, G-quadruplex ssDNA annealed
overnight in 100 mM NaCl were mixed rapidly with KCl at varying concentrations.
We have shown that K<sup>+</sup> could induce the unfolded fraction of ssDNA in
Na<sup>+</sup> solution to fold into G-quadruplex structures in a fast
phase, and bring about structural transitions in two slow phases by replacing
Na<sup>+</sup>. For the fast phase, Gray et al. [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] reported the jumping of CD signal at both 261 and 291
nm when measuring the kinetics of G-quadruplex structural switch induced by
K<sup>+</sup> within 5 s. We think the phenomenon is very likely caused by
K<sup>+</sup>-induced folding of the unfolded ssDNA, as we observed
here.</p><p>As we discussed above, in the Na<sup>+</sup>- or K<sup>+</sup>-induced folding
process, the reorganization of different intermediate structures into the final
structure(s) gives rise to the observed slow phase. However, the structural
transition from Na<sup>+</sup>- to K<sup>+</sup>-induced G-quadruplexes occurs
in two slow phases. This indicates that the G-quadruplex structural transition
process is complicated. The reason may be that, both G-quadruplex structures
(basket-type with Na<sup>+</sup>, hybrid-1 with K<sup>+</sup>) involved in the
transition process are stable, whereas the intermediate structures in the
Na<sup>+</sup>- or K<sup>+</sup>-induced folding processes are usually
unstable.</p><p>Previously, Ambrus et al<italic>.</italic> proposed a structural switch pathway
for the conformational transition from Na<sup>+</sup>- to K<sup>+</sup>-induced
G-quadruplex structures, consisting of three steps [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the first step, the K<sup>+</sup> ions replace the
Na<sup>+</sup> ions inside the basket-type G-quadruplex structure, which
causes no conformational change to the G-quadruplex structure and thus is
undetectable in our kinetic measurements. In the next two steps, the presently
unstable basket-type G-quadruplex structure partially unfolds, and then refolds
into the hybrid-1 structure. We think the two slow phases that we observed in
our transition assay probably correspond to these two steps.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-3"><title>Influence of ionic strength on G-quadruplex folding kinetics</title><p>It is generally believed that Li<sup>+</sup> has no effect on G-quadruplex
folding and thus Li<sup>+</sup> has been widely used as a control cation in
studies of G-quadruplex folding. Our finding that Li<sup>+</sup> may act as a
cofactor of other cations and actually influence the folding kinetics of
G-quadruplexes even at low concentrations is quite noteworthy. Li<sup>+</sup>
should not be used as a control ion in some cases, otherwise the results for
G-quadruplex folding may be modified.</p><p>The ionic strength is important for the G-quadruplex folding through compacting
DNA. The ions we used in the experiments are all monovalent ions, such as
Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, so
we can use the salt concentrations to evaluate the ionic strength approximately.
Before addition of these salts, the ionic strength of the solution is 8.06 mM,
which is from the 10 mM Tris/HCl buffer. After addition of the salts, the
ionic strength can be considered as the total concentration of the salts (or
Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup>) by neglecting the low
ionic strength from the Tris/HCl buffer.</p><p>To examine the influence of ionic strength on DNA condensation during the folding
process, we carried out control experiments with dT<sub>22</sub> (poly T
sequence) in only Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, or K<sup>+</sup> environments,
and with G-quadruplex ssDNA in only Li<sup>+</sup> environment (Supplementary
Figure S6A&#x02013;D). In each of these cases, the fluorescence intensity remains
the same during the 16-s measurement at a given ionic concentration; however, it
decreases with increasing ionic concentration (Supplementary Figure S6E). This
means that the ionic strength indeed induces the DNA condensation, which is,
however, too fast to be detected in our measurements. In addition, the DNA
condensation is positively correlated with the ionic concentration in each
case.</p><p>From a comparison between the results for dT<sub>22</sub> and those for the
G-quadruplex ssDNA, it was found that Li<sup>+</sup> has greater condensing
effect on G-quadruplex ssDNA than dT<sub>22</sub> (Supplementary Figure S6E).
This is probably because the G-quadruplex ssDNA may quickly fold, aided by
Li<sup>+</sup>, into minor structures, such as G-hairpin, leading to an
increased FRET effect. The possibility of G-quadruplex formation is eliminated
by the CD spectrum in the only Li<sup>+</sup> environment given above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Moreover, no change of
fluorescence intensity that is characteristic of G-quadruplex folding was
observed in the control experiment with only Li<sup>+</sup> (Supplementary
Figure S6D).</p><p>It should be pointed that the effect of ionic-concentration-dependent DNA
condensation on the original fluorescence signals was obvious in all our kinetic
measurements (see, for example, Supplementary Figure S6F), that is, the initial
level of fluorescence intensity in each data curve always decreases with
increasing ionic concentration, just as in the control experiment with only
Li<sup>+</sup> (Supplementary Figure S6D). However, this does not influence
our final results because all the fluorescence intensity curves were normalized
and, in addition, the kinetic processes we observed are only due to the folding
of G-quadruplexes. Thus the variations of kinetic parameters we obtained for
different ionic conditions should reflect solely their effects on G-quadruplex
folding.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that, in previous studies using the stopped-flow
method, the G-quadruplex folding kinetics were investigated by measuring the CD
signal [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the absorption signal
[<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; whereas in the present study,
we measured the fluorescence signal. Compared with the previous measurements,
the fluorescence signal, which correlates with the FRET efficiency between the
two dye molecules labeled on the G-quadruplex ssDNA, can report the change of
distance between the two ends of the ssDNA more directly and sensitively during
its structural transition to G-quadruplexes. From the measurements using the
stopped-flow FRET method here, we were able to determine the G-quadruplex
folding kinetic parameters in different ionic environments. The present
experimental results may play an important role in future studies for further
revealing the folding pathways and structural properties of G-quadruplexes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec5"><title>Supporting information</title><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>The FRET effect caused by G-quadruplex folding</title><p>Fluorescence intensities of FAM (donor) at 525 nm and Hex (acceptor) at 595
