Rhubarb is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine as a laxative in China. It markedly protects pancreatic acinar cells from trypsin-induced injury in rats. Free total rhubarb anthraquinones (FTRAs) isolated and extracted from rhubarb display the beneficial effects of antibacteria, anti-inflammation, antivirus, and anticancer. The principal aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of FTRAs on the protection of intestinal injury and modification of the intestinal barrier function through regulation of intestinal immune function in rats with SAP. We established a rat model of SAP by injecting 3.5% sodium taurocholate (STC, 350 mg/kg) into the biliopancreatic duct via retrograde injection and treated the rats with FTRAs (36 or 72 mg/kg) or normal saline (control) immediately and 12 h after STC injection. Then, we evaluated the protective effect of FTRAs on intestinal injury by pathological analysis and determined the levels of endotoxin (ET), interleukin 1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), nitric oxide (NO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), capillary permeability, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain (ASC), casepase-1, secretary immunoglobulin A (SIgA), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and the ratio of Th1/Th2 in the blood and/or small intestinal tissues or mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells. Moreover, the chemical profile of FTRAs was analyzed by HPLC-UV chromatogram. The results showed that FTRAs significantly protected intestinal damage and decreased the levels of ET, IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and NO in the blood and TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and protein extravasation in the intestinal tissues in SAP rats. Furthermore, FTRAs significantly decreased the expressions of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1, the number of Tregs and the ratio of Th1/Th2, while significantly increased the expression of SIgA in the intestinal tissues and/or MLN cells in SAP rats. Our results indicate that FTRAs could protect intestinal injury and improve intestinal mucosal barrier function through regulating immune function of SAP rats. Therefore, FTRAs may have the potential to be developed as the novel agent for the treatment of SAP clinically.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rhubarb</kwd><kwd>free total rhubarb anthraquinones</kwd><kwd>sever acute pancreatitis</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>inflammasome</kwd><kwd>immune function</kwd><kwd>intestinal mucosal barriery</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="72"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a sudden inflammation of the pancreas and one of the most common urgent abdominal diseases. Although most patients with AP are self-limited with low incidence of complications, 10&#x02013;20% patients may develop to severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) with 30% mortality rate due to secondary infection and organ failure (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Thoeni, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Vaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). The principal pathological change of SAP is autodigestion from digestive enzymes such as trypsin (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Sha et al., 2009</xref>). However, the pathogenesis of SAP is complex and the exact mechanism has not been fully clarified. The intestinal tract is the body&#x02019;s largest immune organ and the impairment of intestinal mucosal barrier function could cause the development of local and systemic septic complications in patients with SAP (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ammori et al., 2002</xref>). Intestinal mucosal immune dysfunction induced by bacterial translocation, endotoxemia, and infection is the leading cause of death in patients with SAP (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Capurso et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is generally believed that the intestinal immune response consists of two phases with an initiative hyperinflammatory phase followed by subsequent potential hypoinflammatory phase in SAP (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mylona et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gunjaca et al., 2012</xref>). The initial hyperinflammatory phase in SAP is characterized by activation of innate immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages and other immune cells to release a large amount of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-&#x003b3;, platelet activation factor, and the chemokines (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Makhija and Kingsnorth, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mylona et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gunjaca et al., 2012</xref>). The hypoinflammatory or immunosuppressive phase in SAP occurred in the later stage is characterized as &#x0201c;counter anti-inflammatory response&#x0201d; by induction of IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist and drift of T-helper cells (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Makhija and Kingsnorth, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mylona et al., 2011</xref>). Study has shown that the intestinal barrier plays an important role in SAP (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al., 2013</xref>). The mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues in intestine constitute the intestinal immune barrier to effectively prevent the invasion of bacteria and endotoxin (ET, lipopolysaccharide) from intestine into the blood (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">ZhaXi et al., 2014</xref>). However, bacteria and ET may pass through the intestine into the sterile abdominal cavity (peritoneum) to cause serious complications when the intestinal barrier function is weakened or damaged (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Vaishnavi, 2013</xref>). Therefore, it may be an effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of SAP through regulation of intestinal immune function and restoration of normal intestinal mucosal barrier.</p><p>Rhubarb is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine as a laxative in China. Studies from clinical trials have shown that rhubarb has beneficial effect on patients with SAP for significant improvement of the gastrointestinal function and inhibition of systemic inflammation (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Rhubarb markedly protects pancreatic acinar cells from trypsin-induced injury by inhibiting the synthesis, secretion and release of trypsin in rats (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, rhubarb reduces the permeability of the capillaries, inhibits the releases of inflammatory cytokines and oxygen free radical, promotes intestinal goblet cell hyperplasia, and improves microcirculation of intestinal mucosa (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Neyrinck et al., 2017</xref>). However, rhubarb has some disadvantages such as containing too many ingredients and great variation in efficacy. In addition, a large dose of traditional decoction is needed for the treatment of SAP and it may aggravate the gastrointestinal burden of patients to cause more complications and the mechanistic action is still unclear. Thus, these shortcomings limit its clinical applications for the treatment of SAP. On the contrary, free total rhubarb anthraquinones (FTRAs) isolated and extracted from rhubarb, have the advantages over rhubarb including relatively small number of ingredients, easier quality control, smaller dose for disease treatment and better clinical applications (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Although the effect of rhubarb on modulation of intestinal immune functions has been demonstrated (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), the effect of FTRAs on the intestinal immune function and underlying mechanisms remain unclear in the treatment of SAP. Our previous studies have demonstrated that rhubarb and FTRAs have equivalent effect to ameliorate the injury of intestine, liver and kidney by reducing inflammatory cascades mediated by cytokines and systemic inflammatory response in rats with SAP (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). We hypothesized that FTRAs may display significant effect on organ protection via regulating the intestinal immune response at early stage in the treatment of SAP. In order to overcome the shortcomings and improve the therapeutic effect of rhubarb, we aimed to provide the scientific rationale for the development of FTRAs as a more efficacious novel agent for the treatment of SAP clinically. Therefore, we selected FTRAs for the present studies.</p><p>In the present studies, to rationally design the experiments, we first investigated the effects of FTRAs on intestinal injury protection and determination of ET, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, NO, and MPO in blood and/or in small intestinal tissues in SAP rats. We also studied the possible associated mechanisms with the therapeutic effects of FTRAs by investigating protein extravasation and the expressions of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 in the small intestinal tissues and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells in SAP rats to evaluate the non-specific (innate) immune response of intestine in SAP rats. Furthermore, we also investigated the effects of FTRAs on the expressions of SIgA, Th cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the small intestines or MLN cells to assess the specific (adaptive) immune response of intestine in SAP rats. In addition, we also studied the chemical profile of FTRAs for future development of active purified compound. The results show that FTRAs could markedly protect intestinal damage induced by SAP and reduce the levels of inflammatory factors TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, ET, and NO in the blood and/or intestine. FTRAs also regulate mucosal function through the downregulation of the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome, increase of the expression of SIgA, decreased the number of Tregs, and restoration of the balance of Th1/Th2. Therefore, the results may provide a scientific rationale for the development of FTRAs as a novel agent to overcome the shortcomings of rhubarb for the treatment of SAP clinically.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Materials and Regents</title><p>Free total rhubarb anthraquinones were purchased from the Research Institute (Huaian, Jiangsu, China, batch number: 20130211) and dissolved in normal saline (NS).

The rats were randomly divided into four groups with 14 rats for each group, control group: normal rats treated with NS; SAP group: SAP rats treated with NS; FTRAs-1 group: SAP rats treated with 36 mg/kg FTRAs; and FTRAs-2 group: SAP rats treated with 72 mg/kg FTRAs. The dose selection for FTRAs was first estimated from the dose of rhubarb clinical used for the treatment of patients with SAP and converted from the calculation of the body surface area of rat/human and the extraction ratio of FTRAs from Rhubarb. Then, we performed several pre-experiments with different doses and determined FTRAs at 72 mg/kg or lower dose to be the appropriate dose for the study. Treatments were initiated immediately and 12 h after STC injection by intragastric administration. Eight rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 50 mg/kg of 2.0% pentobarbital sodium 24 h after treatment. The blood was drawn from the abdominal aorta of rats. Plasma and serum were prepared for determination of ET, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and NO.

Th cells are the central cells of the body&#x02019;s specific immune response. Next, we studied the effect of FTRAs on Th cells in SAP rats. The expressions of CD4<sup>+</sup> IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> IL-4<sup>+</sup> present the populations of Th1 and Th2 cells, and the ratio of Th1/Th2 represents their balance.

The innate immune cells in the intestine can activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) and inflammasome signal pathway through pattern recognition receptors [Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nod-like receptors (NLRs)], rapidly initiating inflammatory responses (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hoque et al., 2014</xref>). NLRP3 inflammasome is one of the best characterized NLR family members and a key component of the innate immune system (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cassel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chang, 2013</xref>). It is composed of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 and an important regulatory factor of inflammation and cell apoptosis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agostini et al., 2004</xref>). NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in activation of caspase-1, release of IL-1&#x003b2;, and pathogenesis of SAP (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hoque et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Youm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). ASC activates caspase-1 precursors into active form and caspaes-1 not only plays an important role in signal transduction but also in activation of inflammasome in inflammatory response (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Mogensen, 2009</xref>). Caspase-1 is able to transform in active pro-IL-1&#x003b2; and pro-IL-18 to biological active IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hitzler et al., 2012</xref>).

The present studies demonstrated that the expressions of NLRP3, ASC and casepase-1 in small intestines and MLN cells were significantly higher in SAP rats than that of normal rats. Interestingly, FTRAs significantly decreased the expressions of NLRP3, ASC and casepase-1 in small intestine and MLN cells in SAP rats (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). Our previous studies have shown that FTRAs could inhibit the expression of NF-kB (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2007</xref>).

Intestinal mucosal surface immunoglobulin SIgA is the first line of intestinal mucosal defense and plays a key role in humoral immunity (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Diebel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Auria et al., 2013</xref>). <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al.

In our results, the levels of SIgA in the intestines of SAP rats were also significantly decreased compared to that of normal rats, indicating that the function of B lymphocyte of SAP rats was severely impaired and resulted in significant reduction of SIgA secretion. The results are consistent with the results from previous studies (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2013</xref>).

Studies have shown that Th1 cells secreted excessive amounts of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-1&#x003b2;, while Th2 cells mainly induced humoral immunity mediated by anti-inflammatory cytokines in patients with early SAP (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Mosmann and Coffman, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Oiva et al., 2010</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; secreted by Th1 cells can induce apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells and activates macrophages to further secrete TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Duque and Descoteaux, 2014</xref>). Thus, TNF-&#x003b1; is a vital factor to connect innate immunity and adaptive immune response and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of SAP. Th1 cells inhibits Th2 cells after their activation by antigens to induce Th1/Th2 cytokine dynamic imbalance and result in a series of inflammatory reaction and aggravating intestinal injury, further triggering the productions of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and other serious consequences in patients with SAP (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Rangel-Frausto et al., 1995</xref>). The balance of Th1/Th2 is crucial for maintaining homeostasis in the body, the change in the ratio of Th1/Th2 has a profound impact on the body immune function and imbalance of Th1/Th2 can cause SAP (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Sattler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Hussein and Ahmed, 2016</xref>). Therefore, reduction of the ratio of Th1/Th2 to restore their balance may be an effective strategy to prevent further deterioration in SAP patients. In the present results, our results showed that the ratio of Th1/Th2 was dramatically increased by increasing Th1 and decreasing Th2 to induce excessive inflammatory response with high levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x000df; in SAP rats (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref></bold>). Interestingly, FTRAs significantly decreased the elevated ratio of Th1/Th2 and restored their balance to near normal level with significant lower levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; in SAP rats (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref></bold>), suggesting that FTRAs may be effective in regulation of intestinal adaptive immunity.</p><p>Tregs are suppressive T cells that have an essential role in maintaining the balance between immune activation and tolerance (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Hussein and Ahmed, 2016</xref>). The transcription factor CD4 + Foxp3 of Tregs is identified as the most specific markers of Tregs (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Yun et al., 2015</xref>). Tregs exert their immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting INF-&#x003b3; secretion and promoting IL-4 secretion (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2013</xref>). In normal condition, IL-4 secreted by Th2 cells can prevent the activation of macrophages and production of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; to inhibit inflammation and reduce tissue damage (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Hussein and Ahmed, 2016</xref>). Studies have shown that Tregs were decreased and negatively correlated with serum concentration of TNF-&#x003b1; and the decrease of Tregs may be responsible for uncontrolled immune activation to cause excessive inflammatory response in SAP (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2017</xref>). However, another study has showed that the Tregs are abnormal high in SAP patients and elevated circulating Tregs is an independent prognostic biomarker for patients with ASP (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Minkov et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, we found that the levels of CD4 + Foxp3 and Tregs population were significantly increased with positive correlation with the blood levels of ET, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2; in SAP rats. The finding is inconsistent with some studies (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2017</xref>), but is supported by others (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Minkov et al., 2017</xref>). Our results indicated that the Tregs were activated under inflammatory condition and intestinal mucosal immunity was shifted from an over-inflammatory state to an immunosuppressed state in ASP rats. The possible reason for the different finding from different studies may be related to observation time difference, the immune response was varied at different times so multiple time points observation may be necessary to study the dynamic change of immune function in SAP to help better understand of the immune response at different stages. In addition, different studied samples may be another possible reason. We used MLN cells for the present study while other groups used blood sample for their studies. Interestingly, FTRAs can significantly decrease the expression of Foxp3 and population of Treg (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref></bold>). The present results showed that FTRAs are effective in regulation of the intestinal immune function in SAP rats by inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome, upregulation of SIgA, restoration of Th1/Th2 cells balance, and decrease of Tregs number. Previous study has shown that the main ingredients of FTRAs include rhubarb, emodin, aloe-emodin and their glycosides (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aichner and Ganzera, 2015</xref>). In the present study, we revealed that FTRAs consist of five compounds including aloe-emodine, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol, and physcione by UHPLC-UV analysis (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>). We will investigate the effects of individual compound on intestinal protection and immune modulation in animal models to identify the most effective compound(s) for the treatment of SAP in the future study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our studies elucidated that SAP induced by STC could destroy intestinal immune functions to trigger specific manifestations including intestinal injury, increase of ET, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, NO, and intestinal permeability, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, increase of Tregs number, and induction of Th1/Th2 imbalance in rats. However, FTRAs protected the intestinal injury and improved intestinal mucosal function through decrease of ET, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, NO and intestinal permeability and downregulation of the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome to modulate intestinal non-specific immune response. Furthermore, FTRAs also increased the expression of SIgA, decreased the number of Tregs, and restored the balance of Th1/Th2 to modulate intestinal specific immune response in SAP rats. Therefore, FTRAs may have the potential to be developed as the novel agent for the treatment of SAP clinically. However, further studies are required to find out the active ingredients of FTRAs to identify the purified compound(s) to be developed and understand the exact mechanism of action, particularly the intestinal immune system including the role of FTRAs in the TLRs and NLRs signaling pathways, associated with their efficacy in SAP treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors listed have made contribution to the work and approved it for publication.
