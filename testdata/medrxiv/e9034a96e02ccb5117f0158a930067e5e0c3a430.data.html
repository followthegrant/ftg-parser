<meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Since the beginning of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, cancer patients affected by COVID-19 have been reported to experience poor prognosis; however, a detailed quantification of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on outcome of unvaccinated cancer patients has not been performed.

Methods To carry out a systematic review of the studies on outcome of unvaccinated cancer patients infected by Sars-Cov-2, a search string was devised which was used to identify relevant publications in PubMed up to December 31, 2020. We selected three outcomes: mortality, access to ICU, and COVID-19 severity or hospitalization. We considered results for all cancers combined as well as for specific cancers. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses of the results, overall and after stratification by region. We also performed sensitivity analyses according to quality score and assessed publication bias.

Results For all cancer combined, the pooled odds ratio (OR) for mortality was 2.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82-2.94, I2 for heterogeneity 90.1%, 24 studies), that for ICU admission was 2.39 (95% CI 1.90-3.02, I2 0.0%, 5 studies), that for disease severity or hospitalization was 2.08 (95% CI 1.60-2.72, I2 92.1%, 15 studies). The pooled mortality OR for hematologic neoplasms was 2.14 (95% CI 1.87-2.44, I2 20.8%, 8 studies). Data were insufficient to perform a meta-analysis for other cancers. In the mortality meta-analysis for all cancers, the pooled OR was higher for studies conducted in Asia than studies conducted in Europe or North America. There was no evidence of publication bias.

Conclusions Our meta-analysis indicate a two-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes (mortality, ICU admission and severity of COVID-19) in unvaccinated cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to uninfected patients. These results should be compared with studies conducted in vaccinated patients; nonetheless, they argue for special effort to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cancer.

I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.

Not Applicable

I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).

<meta name="twitter:description" content="Background Since the beginning of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, cancer patients affected by COVID-19 have been reported to experience poor prognosis; however, a detailed quantification of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on outcome of unvaccinated cancer patients has not been performed.

Methods To carry out a systematic review of the studies on outcome of unvaccinated cancer patients infected by Sars-Cov-2, a search string was devised which was used to identify relevant publications in PubMed up to December 31, 2020. We selected three outcomes: mortality, access to ICU, and COVID-19 severity or hospitalization. We considered results for all cancers combined as well as for specific cancers. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses of the results, overall and after stratification by region. We also performed sensitivity analyses according to quality score and assessed publication bias.

Results For all cancer combined, the pooled odds ratio (OR) for mortality was 2.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82-2.94, I2 for heterogeneity 90.1%, 24 studies), that for ICU admission was 2.39 (95% CI 1.90-3.02, I2 0.0%, 5 studies), that for disease severity or hospitalization was 2.08 (95% CI 1.60-2.72, I2 92.1%, 15 studies). The pooled mortality OR for hematologic neoplasms was 2.14 (95% CI 1.87-2.44, I2 20.8%, 8 studies). Data were insufficient to perform a meta-analysis for other cancers. In the mortality meta-analysis for all cancers, the pooled OR was higher for studies conducted in Asia than studies conducted in Europe or North America. There was no evidence of publication bias.

Conclusions Our meta-analysis indicate a two-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes (mortality, ICU admission and severity of COVID-19) in unvaccinated cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to uninfected patients. These results should be compared with studies conducted in vaccinated patients; nonetheless, they argue for special effort to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cancer.

We selected three outcomes: mortality, access to ICU, and COVID-19 severity or hospitalization. We considered results for all cancers combined as well as for specific cancers. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses of the results, overall and after stratification by region. We also performed sensitivity analyses according to quality score and assessed publication bias.</p></div><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><p id="p-4"><strong>Results</strong> For all cancer combined, the pooled odds ratio (OR) for mortality was 2.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82-2.94, I<sup>2</sup> for heterogeneity 90.1%, 24 studies), that for ICU admission was 2.39 (95% CI 1.90-3.02, I<sup>2</sup> 0.0%, 5 studies), that for disease severity or hospitalization was 2.08 (95% CI 1.60-2.72, I<sup>2</sup> 92.1%, 15 studies). The pooled mortality OR for hematologic neoplasms was 2.14 (95% CI 1.87-2.44, I<sup>2</sup> 20.8%, 8 studies). Data were insufficient to perform a meta-analysis for other cancers. In the mortality meta-analysis for all cancers, the pooled OR was higher for studies conducted in Asia than studies conducted in Europe or North America. There was no evidence of publication bias.</p></div><div id="sec-4" class="subsection"><p id="p-5"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Our meta-analysis indicate a two-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes (mortality, ICU admission and severity of COVID-19) in unvaccinated cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to uninfected patients. These results should be compared with studies conducted in vaccinated patients; nonetheless, they argue for special effort to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cancer.</p></div><div id="sec-5" class="subsection"><p id="p-6"><strong>Funding</strong> No external funding was obtained.</p></div></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-7">The authors have declared no competing interest.</p><h3>Funding Statement</h3><p id="p-8">No external funding was obtained</p><h3>Author Declarations</h3><p id="p-9">I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.</p><p id="p-10">Not Applicable</p><p id="p-11">The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:</p><p id="p-12">a) All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. b) The study was considered exempt and the informed consent was not deemed necessary given the nature of the study</p><p id="p-13">I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.</p><p id="p-14">Not Applicable</p><p id="p-15">I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
