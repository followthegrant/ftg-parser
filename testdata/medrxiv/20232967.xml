<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Understanding the causes of the diverse outcome of COVID-19 pandemic in different geographical locations is important for the vaccine implementation and pandemic control responses. Here, we examined the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T-cell responses in unexposed individuals and patients recovered from mild COVID-19. Using HLA class II predicted peptide megapools, we identified SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in around 70&#x0025; of the unexposed individuals. Moreover, we found detectable immune reactivity up to 5 months in mild COVID-19 recovered patients in the two major arms of protective adaptive immunity; CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and B cells. Interestingly, the persistent immune reactivity in COVID-19 patients is predominantly targeted towards the Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. This study provides the evidence of both high magnitude pre-existing and persistent immune memory in Indian population. By providing the knowledge on cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, our work has implication for the evaluation and implementation of vaccines against COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has evolved with variable trajectory in diverse geographical locations. Pre-existing T cell memory acquired from &#x2018;common cold&#x2019; Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs) could have substantial implication in the immunological and epidemiological outcome of the pandemic. Because of the diverse geo-distribution and prevalence of HCoVs, there may be a varying impact of pre-existing immunity on the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, there is a considerable interest to understand the traits of pre-existing immunity and its impact on the virus spread and pathogenesis, disease outcome and the establishment of protective immunity in COVID-19.</p>
<p>In context of pre-existing immunity, the cross-reactive T cells are the focus of extensive investigations. Recent reports reveal the existence of cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in &#x223C;20-50&#x0025; of the individuals never been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). These cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells are largely canonical memory cells and they may be the outcome of previous infections with many of the common cold HCoVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The cross-reactive memory CD4 T-cell subsets may lead to a favorable course of SARS-CoV-2 infection via direct anti-viral effects of CD4-CTL (Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes) or T helper cells, and also via establishing optimal germinal centers derived protective humoral immunity by follicular T helper cells. In fact, the cross-reactive immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 is limited to CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and more studies are required to understand the cross-reactivity from HCoVs in case of the humoral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Although most of these studies are limited to the antibody analyses and there is no firm knowledge available for the cross-reactivity in the B cell pool. The Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is the major target of neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Particularly, antibodies targeting RBD display high neutralizing potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) and shown to be predicative of survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). However, there has been a concern over the decline of antibodies within first few months after SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Although, it&#x2019;s not clear if this decline is gradual and if the similar decline exists in the memory pool of T cells and B cells.</p>
<p>The cross-reactive immunity acquired from the common cold HCoVs may have substantial impact on the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and also to the COVID-19 vaccine. Although, the exact origin is not known the geo-distribution and prevalence of common cold HCoVs may impact the magnitude and targets of cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and may lead to a diverse outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the traits and impact of pre-existing immunity and the stability of immune memory in the crucial arms of protective immunity needs to be explored across the diverse populations. In this study, we have examined the traits and stability of immune memory in unexposed donors and patients recovered from mild COVID-19. We show that the SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells exist in the unexposed donors, with Non-spike domains as the predominant target of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in &#x223C;70&#x0025; of the individuals. Moreover, we also show that immune reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in mild COVID-19 patients at least up to 5 months after recovery in the crucial arms of protective immunity; CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and B cells. Interestingly, the durable immune reactivity in COVID-19 patients was highly targeted towards the Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. Our work provides the evidence of pre-existing reactivity and immune memory detectable in mild COVID-19 patients from the geographical location that is experiencing high burden of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with an extremely low case fatality.</p>

<title>Antibody response in unexposed donors and mild COVID-19 recovered patients with synchronous expansion of antibodies to HCoV-OC43</title>
<p>To investigate the quality and stability of immune reactivity in the COVID-19 patients we recruited 28 adult patients who had recovered from mild COVID-19 (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). To explore the impact of cross-reactive immunity from &#x2018;common cold&#x2019; coronaviruses we also utilized plasma samples and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy blood donors collected prior to the pandemic during 2018-2019. The SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in all the recruited patients by swab based viral PCR test. None of the patients required hospitalization and were quarantined with the mild-to-moderate manifestation of the disease. The blood sample was collected after 2 to 5 months of recovery from the date of diagnosis. All the patients showed high titer IgG response to the full-length spike unlike unexposed donors that showed no evidence of spike-reactive IgG (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A-B</xref></bold>). SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein-reactive IgG was present in 15 of the 42 unexposed donors tested, and the titer was significantly higher in the mild COVID-19 recovered patients (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C-D</xref></bold>). We further analyzed neutralizing antibodies in 8 unexposed donors and 12 COVID-19 patients after &#x2265;4 months of recovery. We observed the presence of highly effective neutralizing antibodies in all the patients after the long duration of recovery (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>). Because we observed cross-reactive antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in unexposed donors, we examined the IgG reactivity to nucleoproteins from common-cold HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 as a representative betacoronavirus and alphacoronavirus, respectively. Interestingly, IgG reactivity was present against both the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 in almost all the unexposed donors. Interestingly, an increase in IgG reactivity in COVID-19 recovered patients was noted, but limited to the HCoV-OC43 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref></bold>). Thus, the data suggest a detectable spike- and nucleoprotein-specific antibody response in the Indian patients recovered from mild disease, at least up to 5 months post COVID-19 diagnosis. Surprisingly, COVID-19 patients showed an increase in IgG response against the HCoV-OC43 but not to the other common cold coronavirus tested, HCoV-NL-63, which may have less closely related Nucleoprotein to SARS-CoV-2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>

<title>Robust SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T-cell responses in unexposed donors and mild COVID-19 cases</title>
<p>CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells are crucial for both the anti-viral response and the optimal quality of protective humoral immunity. Thus, we examined the CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell reactivity in unexposed donors and the patients recovered from mild COVID-19. We measured the SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in the T cell receptor (TCR) dependent activation induced marker assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Here, for antigen-specific analysis, we stimulated the PBMCs from 18 COVID-19 subjects and 32 unexposed healthy donors (collected during 2018-19 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic) with the peptide megapool spanning the Spike domain (Spike) and the megapool covering the remainder of the SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein (Non-spike) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). A CMV megapool and the Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B (SEB) superantigen was used as the positive control, while DMSO was used as the negative control (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and Fig. S1</bold>).</p>

<p>A total of 5 out of 32 unexposed donors were associated with marginal frequency of SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive AIM<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (OX40<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD137<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells with an insignificant increase over the DMSO control (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). Interestingly, 22 out of 32 unexposed donors robustly responded to the peptide megapool covering the non-spike domains of virus with a significantly higher frequency of AIM<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells over the DMSO control (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>; DMSO vs Non-spike pool, P=0.0002). The unexposed donors consistently responded to the CMV peptide megapool and the SEB superantigen significantly over the DMSO control (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>; DMSO vs CMV pool, P=0.0005; DMSO vs SEB, P&#x003C;0.0001). All of the COVID-19 recovered patients showed robust activation and high frequency AIM<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in response to the spike peptide megapool (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>; DMSO vs Spike megapool, P&#x003C;0.0001). Although the frequency of non-spike specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells was low, all patients showed the presence of AIM<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in response to the non-spike peptide pool (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>; DMSO vs Non-spike megapool, P&#x003C;0.0001). Like unexposed donors, COVID-19 patients readily responded to the CMV peptide pool and SEB stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>; DMSO vs CMV pool, P=0.0003; DMSO vs SEB, P&#x003C;0.0001). Next, we measured the stimulation index of antigen specific stimulations over the unstimulated DMSO control to quantify CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell reactivity in case of pre-existing immunity and in long-term post recovery from COVID-19. We observed a remarkably higher frequency of Spike-specific memory CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in recovered patients than the unexposed donors (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>; Unexposed vs COVID-19, P&#x003C;0.0001). Surprisingly, higher magnitude of Non-spike specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells were present in the unexposed donors with a marginally higher ratio in recovered COVID-19 patients (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>; Unexposed vs COVID-19, P=0.02). We also determined the memory phenotype of the CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells responding to the spike and non-spike peptide megapools (<bold>Fig. S2 A</bold>). Both the central memory and effector memory compartments were mainly populated in antigen-specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells responding to spike and non-spike genome of SARS-CoV-2. However, no significant difference in the proportion of central memory or effector memory cells was observed between the spike and non-spike specific AIM<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (<bold>Fig. S2 B</bold>). Altogether, the antigen-specific T cell analyses suggest the existence of Spike-specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in unexposed donors with a remarkably high magnitude in case of recovery from mild COVID-19. Interestingly, almost similar magnitude of non-spike specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells are present in unexposed and COVID-19 recovery patients. Detection of Spike-specific memory CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells several months after infection is encouraging for the efforts focusing on SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein as a vaccine candidate.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>High magnitude Spike-specific B cells in mild COVID-19 recovered subjects</title>
<p>Because the mild COVID-19 patients showed robust Spike-specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells reactivity, we examined if a similar finding would extend to SARS-CoV-2 B cell responses. Thus, utilizing SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Nucleoprotein (representative of Non-spike domains), we analyzed the frequency of each isotype-specific antibody secreting B cell population in 8 patients after &#x003E;4 months of recovery from mild disease (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). The magnitude of IgG antibody secreting cells (ASC) was the highest among three subsets analyzed. Surprisingly, all the patients showed significant 8-fold higher Spike-specific IgG-ASC over the ASCs specific to SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>;</bold> Count/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs: Spike - 880&#x00B1;55, Nucleoprotein - 109&#x00B1;48; P=0.0002). Although, the frequency of Nucleoprotein-specific IgM-ASCs was higher than the Nucleoprotein-specific IgG-ASCs, it was not significantly different than the Spike-specific IgM-ASCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>;</bold> Count/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs: Spike - 217&#x00B1;35, Nucleoprotein - 247&#x00B1;48). Plasma cells secreting IgA were present in the least frequency in COVID-19 recovered patients. However, like IgG-ASCs, Spike-specific memory IgA-ASCs were present in 5-fold higher frequency than the Nucleoprotein-specific cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>;</bold> Count/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs: Spike - 52&#x00B1;15, Nucleoprotein - 11&#x00B1;9; P=0.009). Altogether, these results indicate the existence of high magnitude IgG secreting cells in the antigen specific B-cell pool of mild COVID-19 patients. Like in the case of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, a significant number of B cells is found in long-term after recovery from mild COVID-19, targeted towards the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is an urgent need to understand the attributes of pre-existing immunity and persistence of immune memory in COVID-19. Here, we report the extent of immune memory in individuals up to 5 months after the recovery from mild COVID-19. The existence of high titer Spike- and Nucleoprotein-specific IgG after several months post-infection indicates persistent antibody response in mild disease. Our observation is consistent with the recent reports where no decline was observed in antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 within 4 to 5 months of the COVID-19 diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). This is important information for the vaccine development as the antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 Spike are not swiftly waning from the circulation, at least in the case of mild disease.</p>
<p>In our cohort, SARS-CoV-2 Spike cross-reactive antibodies were not detected in the unexposed donors&#x2019; samples collected during January 2018 to December 2019. This may be due to highly divergent Spike of SARS-CoV-2 than the seasonal coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). By contrast, almost 35&#x0025; of the unexposed adult donors showed the existence of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein reactive antibodies. Unlike Spike protein, Nucleoprotein antibodies are more cross-reactive within the subgroups of HCoVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and it&#x2019;s likely that the adult population in India has been exposed to common cold HCoVs as frequently as in the case with children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The apparent nucleoprotein cross-reactivity seems to best correlate with the HCoV-OC43 Nucleoprotein-specific antibodies as increased titers associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed with HCoV-OC43, a representative betacoronavirus used in this study. This may be due to more conserve Nucleoprotein immunodominant regions within the same family of betacoronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Although, it&#x2019;s not clear if the similar or the unique epitopes of HCoV-OC43 are associated with this observed expansion. Systematic serological study in a larger cohort will be helpful to understand the cross-reactivity exist in the Nucleoprotein and Spike glycoprotein between the endemic HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s intriguing that antibodies targeting Nucleoprotein existed in unexposed donors and are detectable in high titers in a long-term in mild COVID-19 patients. Because Nucleoprotein is not accessible on the virus surface, these antibodies may not exert the neutralization activity. If they are protective, a plausible mechanism for anti-viral function of the Nucleoprotein antibodies is via antibody-mediated effector functions, like ADCC (Antibody Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity) and CDC (Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity). However, this would only be possible if the Nucleoprotein-related antigens are expressed on the infected cell surface, as detected in case of influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Clearly detailed studies are required to understand the biological implication of Nucleoprotein-specific antibodies in the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and in the disease outcome.</p>
<p>We also determined the specificity and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell responses in mild disease in comparison to the pre-existing immunity in the Indian population. Our observation of poorly detected SARS-CoV-2 Spike-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in unexposed donors is consistent with the findings in the USA and the German cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). However, strikingly higher frequency of SARS-CoV-2 Non-spike specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells were observed in our cohort of unexposed donors, which was in range of 70&#x0025; of the responders as compared to 50&#x0025; in USA and the Singapore cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). In the USA cohort, the cross-reactive epitopes in the Non-spike megapool are scattered all over the genome targeting both the non-structural and structural domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). However, among the structural domains, the epitopes in Non-spike megapool targeted by the CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells are mostly directed toward the Nucleoprotein. Because of substantial homology of Nucleoprotein between common cold HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 and due to high prevalence of related common cold HCoVs, as supported by the IgG reactivity, it&#x2019;s plausible that a higher extent of Nucleoprotein cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells are present in our cohort of unexposed donors. Certainly, in-depth analyses in the unexposed donors are necessary to reveal if the prevalence and frequency of common cold HCoVs defines the cross-reactivity to different epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.</p>
<p>The cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells might not be implicated solely in terminating the virus infection however they may limit the virus burden and reduce the course of symptomatic infection leading to lower incidences of severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). This is particularly interesting in context of the high frequency Nucleoprotein-specific cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells. Nucleoprotein is the first and most abundantly produced multifunctional protein in the virus infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The pre-existing cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells may limit the virus spread by cytolysis of the infected cells that are displaying the processed Nucleoprotein on their surface early in the infection. By controlling the virus spread and reducing the virus burden, pre-existing cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells might be implicated in providing a competitive window to the host to initiate an optimal protective immune response against the SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>Interestingly, high magnitude of Spike- and remainder of the genome CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell responses are present in the patients long after recovery from mild COVID-19. However, unlike Spike-specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells that show a substantially higher magnitude over the cross-reactive T cells in unexposed donors, the non-spike specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells are associated with a lesser increase after COVID-19. There may be multiple mechanisms implicated in this observed outcome; (i) the epitopes in the non-spike group are differentially targeted in the unexposed donors and the COVID-19 patients, limiting expansion in the total pool of cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, (ii) T-cells specific for cross-reactive epitopes are maintained in the memory pool and the T cells targeting non-cross-reactive epitopes are either not expanded de novo or selectively lost over the period of time after COVID-19 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), or (iii) there is an immunodominance of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells targeting the highly immunodominant Spike glycoprotein leading to de novo expansion of Spike-specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and outcompeting the expansion of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells targeting low frequency T-cell epitopes present in Nucleoprotein and the remainder of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Despite of the apparent differences in the threshold of response as compared to the unexposed donors, the spike and non-spike specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells are enriched in both the central and effector memory compartments in the recovered patients. Further investigations in COVID-19 patients and unexposed donors will reveal the underlying mechanism for this diverse response of Spike- and remainder of the genome-specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells. In the similar lines, higher magnitude of Spike-specific IgG and IgA secreting B cells are present almost 5 months after recovery from COVID-19. The substantially higher magnitude of Spike-specific B cells over Nucleoprotein-specific B cells further supports our hypothesis of targeted and stable immune response to highly immunodominant Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in mild disease.</p>
<p>In summary, we show that the individuals recovered from mild disease display a response detectable months after recovery in two crucial arms of protective immunity - CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and B cells. Our study supports the utilization of spike-specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and B cells as an important parameter for vaccine evaluation. We also confirm the existence of pre-existing immunity in the unexposed donors, which is predominantly associated with the non-spike part of the genome of SARS-CoV-2. Although the cross-reactive T cells are present against both the spike and non-spike epitopes, the magnitude of cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells targeting the non-spike epitopes is extremely high in our cohort. Indian continent has seen high burden of the COVID-19 incidences; however, the case fatality rates are extremely low. Whether high magnitude of cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells are contributing to this less severe outcome needs to be addressed. This will be possible by studying the prospective cohorts with varying levels of cross-reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells before exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 and with a diverse clinical outcome of COVID-19. The knowledge from such prospective studies addressing the implication of pre-existing CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in the outcome of disease will be critical for the development, evaluation and implementation of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
