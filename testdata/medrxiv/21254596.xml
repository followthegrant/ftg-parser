<title>Abstract</title>
<p>While several high-penetrance melanoma risk genes are known, variation in these genes fail to explain melanoma susceptibility in a large proportion of high-risk families. As part of a melanoma family sequencing study, including 435 families from Mediterranean populations, we identified a novel <italic>NRAS</italic> variant (c.170A&#x003E;C, p.D57A) in a melanoma-prone family. This variant is absent in exomes in gnomAD, ESP, UKBiobank, and the 1000 Genomes Project, as well as in 11 273 Mediterranean individuals and 109 melanoma-prone families from the US and Australia. This variant occurs in the GTP-binding pocket of NRAS. Differently from other RAS activating alterations, NRAS D57A expression is unable to activate MAPK-pathway both constitutively and after stimulation but enhances EGF-induced PI3K-pathway signaling in serum starved conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>. Consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrating that NRAS D57A does not enrich GTP binding, molecular modeling suggests that the D57A substitution would be expected to impair Mg2&#x002B; binding and decrease nucleotide-binding and GTPase activity of NRAS. While we cannot firmly establish NRAS c.170A&#x003E;C (p.D57A) as a melanoma susceptibility variant, further investigation of <italic>NRAS</italic> as a familial melanoma gene is warranted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Melanoma incidence has been increasing in Australia, Europe, and the United States for several decades. In 2018, there were 290 000 cases of melanoma worldwide, and approximately 5-10&#x0025; of cases occur in individuals with a family history of melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Multiple melanoma-predisposition genes (<italic>CDKN2A, CDK4, BAP1, POT1, TERT, ACD, TERF2IP</italic>) explain melanoma susceptibility in 20-30&#x0025; of melanoma-prone families, suggesting that inherited risk for most families results from multiple moderate to low penetrance susceptibility genes or yet unidentified high-penetrance susceptibility genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>Somatic <italic>NRAS</italic> mutations are identified in approximately 20&#x0025; of primary melanomas and occur in tumors that are <italic>BRAF</italic> wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). In contrast, germline variants of <italic>NRAS</italic> and other genes of the <italic>RAS</italic> pathway predispose to syndromes including Noonan Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In this report we describe a family with a novel germline variant of <italic>NRAS</italic> (c.170A&#x003E;C, p.D57A) in which affected carriers developed melanoma and autoimmunity.</p>

<title>Family clinical history</title>
<p>The proband of the family (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, S1 Fig</bold>) was diagnosed with an invasive cutaneous melanoma of his right arm at age 35-39, which was successfully treated with wide local excision. One year later, he was diagnosed with Sjogren&#x2019;s syndrome after serologies were ordered for chronic xerophthalmia. His symptoms were successfully controlled with artificial tears and did not require systemic treatment. At age 60-64, the patient was diagnosed with an oncocytoma in his right kidney. Prior to this diagnosis, the patient denied any history of pneumothorax or prior skin biopsies demonstrating fibrofolliculomas/trichodiscomas to suggest a diagnosis of Birt&#x2013; Hogg&#x2013;Dub&#x00E9; (BHD) syndrome (OMIM: 135150). On clinical exam, the patient also did not exhibit any white or pink papules on the face that would be consistent with fibrofolliculomas/trichodiscomas.</p>

<p>The proband&#x2019;s mother had two melanomas, with the first diagnosis on the back at age 60-64 and the second diagnosis on the face at age 65-69. She was also diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis as a young adult. The proband&#x2019;s maternal grandmother had anal cancer (reported by the proband as possibly mucosal melanoma, but the diagnosis is unconfirmed), but no history of autoimmune disease. The proband&#x2019;s father was diagnosed with liver cancer at age 65-69, which was thought to be secondary to chronic HCV infection. The proband has two healthy children, both without any history of autoimmune disease, melanoma, or other cancers; his son was diagnosed with clinically dysplastic nevi (as was the proband). The family history was negative for other malignancies. Syndromic features of RASopathies, including facial dysmorphism, cardiac abnormalities, and skin findings (lentigines, hemangiomas), were not present in the family.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Genetics</title>
<p>As part of a larger whole-exome sequencing (WES) study of 435 high-risk melanoma families [675 affected individuals or obligate carriers sequenced] of Mediterranean ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), germline sequencing of the proband and his mother revealed the presence of a shared novel variant in <italic>NRAS</italic> [g.chr1:115256541T&#x003E;G, NM_002524.4 c.170A&#x003E;C, NP_002515.1 p.D57A]; both were mutation-negative for known melanoma susceptibility genes (<italic>CDKN2A, CDK4, BAP1, POT1, TERT, ACD, TERF2IP, and MITF</italic> E318K<italic>)</italic>; the proband did not carry any pathogenic variants in genes associated with oncocytoma (<italic>FLCN, TSC1</italic>, or <italic>TSC2</italic>) or monogenic autoimmune syndromes. Sanger sequencing confirmed this variant in the proband, proband&#x2019;s mother, and proband&#x2019;s unaffected brother (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1B</xref></bold>), with all individuals being heterozygous. No other rare or novel <italic>NRAS</italic> variants were found in other melanoma families. This variant is classified as likely pathogenic by InterVar (applying ClinGen RASopathy recommendation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) and predicted deleterious by multiple <italic>in-silico</italic> prediction tools (REVEL=0.924, CADD=24.3, metaSVM=damaging). The variant has not been observed in ClinVar or HGMD. In addition, similar to somatic activating mutations found in melanomas and nevi (codons 12, 13, and 61) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), or alternatively in the germline of families with a group of syndromic conditions broadly termed rasopathies (codons 12, 13, 50, 58, and 60) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), D57 is located in the RAS GTP-binding pocket.</p>
<p>This variant has not been reported in gnomAD, ESP, UKBiobank, and 1000 Genomes Project other germline codon 57 variants appear to be exceptionally rare, with only a single non-synonymous codon 57 allele (1:g.115256542C&#x003E;T, c.169G&#x003E;A, p.D57N) found in gnomAD (1/113 658 non-Finnish European alleles). While confirming the presence of the variant in DNA from the proband and his mother (used as positive controls), TaqMan genotyping of samples from the MelaNostrum Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) (<bold>S1 Table</bold>) found this alteration to be altogether absent in 5 184 alleles of the same national ancestry as the proband (including both melanoma cases and healthy controls; hundreds of individuals were from the same area of the country from which the family comes), as well as 12 958 additional alleles of Mediterranean ancestry (of different countries as the proband). We also examined additional WES data generated from participants of the EAGLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) study, with this variant absent in 4 404 alleles (1 371 lung cancer cases and 831 healthy controls) as well in 308 melanoma cases from 109 high-risk melanoma families from the US and Australia.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title><italic>In vitro</italic> characterization of NRAS D57A</title>
<p>The D57 residue of NRAS is highly conserved in RAS orthologs and paralogs and located within a guanine nucleotide-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Nearby germline variants T50I and G60E of <italic>NRAS</italic> have been reported in patients with Noonan Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), and <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization showed that these alterations enhanced stimulus-dependent MAPK activation, similar to several somatically activating mutations previously identified in melanomas (G12V, Q61R). To explore the possible functional consequences of the <italic>NRAS</italic> c.170A&#x003E;C (D57A) variant, we expressed it in COS7 cells, and its effect on MAPK and PI3K signaling pathway was compared with both wild-type NRAS and the oncogenic NRAS G12V mutation. While NRAS G12V stimulated constitutive activation of both ERK and AKT, as well as EGF-mediated activation of ERK and AKT under serum-starved conditions, NRAS D57A specifically enhanced AKT but not ERK phosphorylation only upon treatment of human EGF under serum starvation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). Furthermore, enhanced AKT activation via NRAS D57A expression disappears with increased dose of EGF, suggesting that this variant may function under sub-optimal growth conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref></bold>). In addition, D57A NRAS appeared to be deficient in activation of MAPK signaling even in the presence of serum. As D57 is part of the guanine nucleotide-binding pocket and NRAS function is regulated by its nucleotide binding status, we pulled down GTP-bound NRAS with RAF1 RAS-binding domain-conjugated agarose beads. Unlike WT NRAS and NRAS G12V, D57A NRAS was not enriched in the GTP-bound state (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref></bold>), seemingly contradictory to enhanced AKT activation upon EGF treatment but consistent with the overall observed lack of MAPK activation. Of note, we also consistently observed less expression of D57A NRAS than either wild-type NRAS or G12V NRAS, and the NRAS D57A band migrates faster through gels compared to its WT or G12V counterpart, perhaps suggesting altered protein stability and/or post-translational modification.</p>

<title>Molecular modeling of NRAS D57A protein</title>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> data are consistent with molecular modeling of this variant. As most activating RAS mutations activate both MAPK and AKT signaling pathways, NRAS D57A appears to be a unique RAS variant that specifically activates the AKT pathway under low stimulus conditions. Visualization of the RAS nucleotide-binding pocket by neutron crystallography indicates that protonation of D57 will impair Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> retention, thus decrease nucleotide-binding activity and GTPase activity of RAS, making it less stable in structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The D57A variant identified in the melanoma family would be expected to have the same effect as protonation of D57 and as a result, this variant may be predicted to affect its catalytic activity as well as protein stability.</p>
<p>To further characterize the biological effects of the D57A alteration, we used molecular modeling to analyze the molecular behavior of NRAS D57A. We performed the 500 ns simulations for both wild-type NRAS and NRAS D57A in the explicit solvent. D57 contributed to the coordination of Mg2&#x002B; in NRAS, with a distance of &#x223C;4.5&#x00C5;. Upon D57A mutation, the distance of A57 to Mg2&#x002B; is predicted to increase to &#x223C;7.0&#x00C5; (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A-4C</xref></bold>). This is consistent with the molecular findings where D57A NRAS protein was not enriched for its GTP-bound state. In NRAS, D57 interacts with T35 (switch I region) via hydrogen bonds and coordinates the Mg2&#x002B; ion along with S17. In simulations, the D57A variant disrupted the local residue contacts, increasing the side chain distances (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D-4E</xref></bold>). These changes in the local residue contacts by the D57A mutation induce a conformational change of switch I region. The side chain of Y32 reorients towards the GTP&#x2019;s &#x03B3;-phosphate, with the distance decreased (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref></bold>). Notably, D57A NRAS affects the PI3K/AKT pathway but is seemingly deficient in MAPK-pathway activation <italic>in vitro</italic> relative to wild-type NRAS (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). A previous study investigating the effects of man-made mutations to the GTP-binding pocket of HRAS observed that D57A decreases binding to CRAF <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). RAS interacts with the RBD of RAF in the MAPK pathway mainly through the switch I region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), where both the switch I and II regions mediate the RAS interactions with PI3K in the PI3K/AKT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The conformational change of switch I upon D57A mutation is expected to affect the RAF interactions. In sum, the D57A substitution is predicted to impair Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> retention, decrease nucleotide-binding and GTPase activity of RAS, and likely making it less stable in structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), suggesting NRAS D57A is a functional variant enhancing AKT activation under some conditions, as well as potentially altering nucleotide binding activity and protein structure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As part of a large melanoma family exome-sequencing study, we identified a novel germline variant of <italic>NRAS</italic> (c.170A&#x003E;C /p.D57A) in two melanoma cases from a melanoma family. This variant has not been identified in any population to date (cataloged by gnomAD, 1000 Genomes Project, ESP, and UKBiobank), we did not observe it in &#x003E;22 000 Mediterranean alleles (including &#x003E;9 500 alleles from the same country as the proband) and in 109 melanoma-prone families from the US and Australia, and germline alteration of <italic>NRAS</italic> codon 57 appears to be exceedingly rare, with only one single mutant allele (D57N) cataloged by gnomAD. Further, multiple <italic>in-silico</italic> prediction tools predict this variant to be pathogenic.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> assays and molecular modeling suggest that this variant, located within the GTP-binding pocket of NRAS where other recurrent functional germline and somatic variants cluster, clearly alters NRAS function. Notably, while well-characterized germline and somatic variants of RAS proteins most often result in activation of either both PI3K and MAPK, <italic>in vitro</italic> assays demonstrate D57A did not activate MAPK in the presence of serum and enhanced only AKT phosphorylation via EGF under serum starvation, making this subtly-activating variation unique. Consistent with these findings, the corresponding mutation in HRAS has been previously shown to result in decreased binding of HRAS to CRAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays additionally suggest D57A may result in altered protein stability and or post-translational modification, and molecular modeling suggests this mutation is likely to alter Mg<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> retention and decrease nucleotide-binding activity and GTPase activity.</p>
<p>Given the small size of this family, it is difficult to assess the impact of this alteration on melanoma and/or autoimmune syndrome risk, as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) we do not observe <italic>NRAS</italic> variation in other melanoma families, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) observed cosegregation with melanoma may be due to chance, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) we observe this variant in the proband&#x2019;s sibling who has been unaffected to date, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) no germline material is available from other members of this family diagnosed with melanoma or with autoimmune symptoms, nor are tissues from the proband or his mother.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identified a novel, functionally significant germline variant of <italic>NRAS</italic> in a melanoma-prone family. While a direct association with melanoma risk cannot be firmly established from this observation, investigation of <italic>NRAS</italic> variants potentially harbored by other melanoma-prone families including those drawn from other populations, is warranted. The proband was also diagnosed with both Sjogren&#x2019;s syndrome and oncocytoma; further investigation of families with autoimmune diseases and/or kidney tumors may shed additional light on whether this mutation may influence risk of these diseases.</p>
