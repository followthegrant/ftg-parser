<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Importance</title>
<p>Determining the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in children is important for decisions about protective measures for the 2021&#x2013;2022 school year.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Objective</title>
<p>To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples from pediatric patients in the state of Arkansas as an indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Design</title>
<p>The study is a survey of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in children in Arkansas over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. From April 2020 through April 2021, remnant serum samples were collected across five time periods (waves): April 2&#x2013;May 6, June 6&#x2013;August 10, September 8&#x2013;October 17, November 7&#x2013;December 17, 2020 and April 5&#x2013;April 28, 2021.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The multi-site survey collected remnant serum samples from four clinics in Arkansas.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study population consisted of 2400 convenience serum samples from children ages 1&#x2013;18 who visited hospitals or regional clinics in Arkansas for non-COVID19-related reasons.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Exposures</title>
<p>Infection with SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Main outcomes and measures</title>
<p>The presence of IgM and/or IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleoprotein were determined using a two-step ELISA. Seroprevalence was estimated by demographic group, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, metropolitan status, SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and co-morbidities. Association with SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity was determined by demographic group.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rose from 7.9&#x0025; in Wave 1 (95&#x0025;CI, 4.9-10.9&#x0025;) to 25.8&#x0025; in Wave 5 (95&#x0025; CI, 22.2-29.3&#x0025;). Hispanic children had a significantly higher risk of having antibodies than non-Hispanic white children in Wave 3 (RR 2.82, 95&#x0025; CI, 1.81-4.38), Wave 4 (RR 1.76, 95&#x0025; CI, 1.03-3.00), and Wave 5 (RR 2.37, 95&#x0025; CI, 1.69-3.33) Similarly, black children also showed a significantly higher risk of having antibodies than white children in Wave 3 (RR 1.71, 95&#x0025; CI, 1.03-2.84) and Wave 5 (RR 1.59, 95&#x0025; CI, 1.08-2.34).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions and relevance</title>
<p>Our data indicate that more children have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than indicated by diagnostic testing. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, recognition of long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2, and the lack of an authorized pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, these results highlight the importance of including children in SARS-CoV-2 public health, clinical care, and research strategies. These findings are important for state and local officials as they consider measures to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread in schools and daycares for the 2021&#x2013;2022 school year.</p></sec>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and spread globally to cause the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> SARS-CoV-2 has infected nearly 200 million and killed more than 4 million people worldwide, causing massive disruptions to daily life and untold economic losses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in the United States in early 2020 and has caused over 600,000 deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> Children were thought to be important for driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> In March 2020, schools nationwide closed for in-person instruction and classes moved online to curtail SARS-CoV-2 spread.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> However, pediatric infection rates, and thereby the potential level of immunity in children, is not known.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Because approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for those 12 years and under is not expected until late 2021, knowing infection rates in children is important information for school officials as they consider risks and protection measures for the 2021&#x2013;2022 school year.</p>
<p>Children typically experience less severe COVID-19 and may be more likely to have asymptomatic infections, allowing them to unknowingly spread SARS-CoV-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> With asymptomatic infections estimated as high as 50&#x0025;, estimating true infection rates remains challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Although nucleic acid testing can identify active SARS-CoV-2 cases, most infections clear within two weeks and leave asymptomatic cases undocumented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Antibodies generated against prior infections can last for months to years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the blood can indicate that a person was infected at some point in the pandemic. Serological studies can capture asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, and more accurately estimate of how many people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Here, we present the results of a seroprevalence study of children ages 1&#x2013;18 years of age who visited hospitals or regional clinics in Arkansas for non-COVID19-related reasons over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Human specimens</title>
<p>All human specimens were obtained with oversight from the UAMS Institutional Review Board (IRB), and waiver of consent and HIPAA applied. Remnants of serum samples collected for routine, non-COVID-19-related clinical laboratory tests were obtained from Arkansas Children&#x2019;s Hospital (ACH, Little Rock, AR), Arkansas Children&#x2019;s Northwest (Springdale, AR), and UAMS Family Medical Centers (Ft. Smith, AR and Pine Bluff, AR). Samples were de-identified prior to testing. Inclusion criteria were ages 1&#x2013;18 years and Arkansas resident. Samples were excluded with the following diagnosis codes: immunodeficiency (primary immune deficiency (D80&#x2013;D89)), transplant recipient (codes beginning with Z94), and cancer (C00&#x2013;D49). Samples from patients receiving chemotherapy (prior two months), steroids (prior 30 days), and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (prior 6 months) were excluded. Samples were selected by pathologists at each clinic after they were considered remnant. Clinical and demographic variables were stored in a secure REDCap database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and included age, sex, race/ethnicity, zip code, and county of residence. Metropolitan status was determined by cross-referencing zip codes with the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) data files identifying non-metropolitan counties and rural census tracts.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Protein production and purification</title>
<p>HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco&#x2019;s minimum essential media (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10&#x0025; heat-inactivated calf serum (CS, VWR), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 U/mL penicillin/100 &#x00B5;g/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). Briefly, 15 cm dishes seeded with 9&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> cells on the preceding day were transfected with 20 &#x00B5;g of pCAGGS-SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD-C-terminal 6-His tag (BEI Resources), pCAGGS SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 ectodomain Spike glycoprotein gene-C-terminal 6-His tag, or pCMV3 2019-nCoV nucleoprotein-C-terminal 6-His tag (Sino Biological) using polyethylamine (PEI) at a 1:3 ratio. DNA:PEI mixtures were incubated at RT for 10 mins and added to cells with the media volume reduced to 5 mL/dish. After 4&#x2013;6 hours, the media volume was raised to 25 mL. SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Spike ectodomain proteins were purified as described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Nucleoprotein (N) was isolated as described above under denaturing conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Protein concentration was measured by DC Protein Assay (BioRad). Purified proteins were confirmed by Coomassie and western blot using antigen-specific antibodies and stored at -80&#x00B0;C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>ELISAs</title>
<p>Serum was inactivated at 56&#x00B0;C for 1 h and initially screened by ELISA specific for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Commercial anti-RBD (Sino Biologicals; 1:2500 dilution) and SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR-positive patient sera (1:50 dilution) served as positive controls. Purified human IgG (Sigma; 1:2500 dilution) and pre-COVID-19 patient sera (1:50 dilution) served as negative controls. Serum IgM and IgG were detected using horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgM&#x002B;IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch; diluted 1:5000 in PBS-T &#x002B; 1&#x0025; milk) and SureBlue TMB 1-Component Peroxidase Substrate (SeraCare; 75 &#x00B5;L). After 5 min, the reaction was terminated using TMB Stop Solution (SeraCare; 75 &#x00B5;L). The OD<sub>450</sub> was measured using a FluoStar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). The final OD<sub>450</sub> was calculated by subtracting the mean OD<sub>450</sub> of blank wells from the mean OD<sub>450</sub> of duplicate samples. The statistical cutoff for RBD binding was defined as the mean OD<sub>450</sub> &#x002B; 3 standard deviations of pre-COVID-19 sera.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Confirmation RBD-positive specimens was performed using a Four-Antigen Confirmation Test (FACT) ELISA. An additional 5&#x0025; of negative sera were randomly selected and tested in parallel. Plates were coated with 2 &#x00B5;g/mL RBD, spike, nucleoprotein, or bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma Aldrich) and FACT ELISA was performed as above. Confirmed positive samples were defined by (i) a mean signal for any viral antigen over 0.6 OD<sub>450</sub>, (ii) BSA-subtracted viral antigen value &#x003E;0.3 OD<sub>450</sub>, (iii) and at least two positive antigens (RBD&#x002B;/Spike&#x002B;, RBD&#x002B;/N&#x002B;, Spike&#x002B;/N&#x002B;, or RBD&#x002B;/Spike&#x002B;/N&#x002B;). The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 94.6&#x0025; and 100&#x0025;, respectively, based on 37 pre-COVID-19 and 19 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive sera.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The descriptive analysis was conducted for the study population demographics by wave. SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rates were reported with 95&#x0025; confidence intervals (CI) using exact binomial distributions. The 2019 U.S. Census Bureau Arkansas state population estimates (age&#x2264;18) were used to calculate the standardized positivity rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> The age- and sex-standardized positivity rates were reported for each wave. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to examine the relationship between variables and the SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate for each wave. Relative risk was estimated by modified Poisson regressions with robust error variance as the measure to characterize association effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> For multivariable analyses, factors being considered were age group, sex, and race/ethnicity. The statistical significance level was set at 0.05. We conducted all analyses using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).</p>

<title>Enrollment and demographic representation</title>
<p>We collected 2400 total remnant pediatric serum samples across five collection periods: Wave 1, April 2&#x2013;May 6, 2020 (n=316); Wave 2, June 6&#x2013;August 10, 2020, (n=300); Wave 3, September 8&#x2013;October 17, 2020, (n=594); Wave 4, November 7&#x2013;December 17, 2020, (n=600); and Wave 5, April 5&#x2013;April 28, 2021, (n=590) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the demographic characteristics for the study.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that by the end of April 2021, approximately 25&#x0025; of children in Arkansas had SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. This percentage is much higher than the total number of confirmed cases, which on April 28, 2021 was 11&#x0025; for the total population of Arkansas (335,288 positive cases according the Arkansas Department of Health, population of 3,011,524 according to 2019 census data). This finding indicates that those children had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and are likely to have at least some natural immunity. Conversely, our findings suggest that most children in Arkansas have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain susceptible to infection. Although COVID-19 has been less severe in children than adults early in the pandemic, emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in May 2021 has driven up infection and hospitalization rates, including among those under 18 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> Developing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a severe inflammatory disorder that results from a current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, is also a risk for those under 18 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates combined with a highly susceptible pediatric population raises the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could spread rapidly in schools and daycares during the upcoming school year. More children infected with SARS-CoV-2 could lead to an increase in the number of severe COVID-19 and MIS-C cases, and a rise in pediatric deaths.</p>
<p>The first SARS-CoV-2 infections in Arkansas were reported in March 2020 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> Arkansas schools suspended in-person learning on March 15, 2020 and many activities where children congregate during the summer were closed. We found that the seroprevalence rate in children increased modestly between spring and summer, suggesting that these protective measures effectively limited SARS-CoV-2 spread among children in Arkansas. The larger increase in seroprevalence for September/October (Wave 3), corresponded with the start of the 2020-2021 school year. However, masks and social distancing measures were in place, and many Arkansas students began the school year as remote learners. These actions likely reduced SARS-CoV-2 spread in schools, as reported outbreaks were relatively rare. Despite a dramatic increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases in Arkansas during November and December, the seroprevalence rate in children dropped during Wave 4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> The decrease suggests that preventative measures in schools were effective at limiting SARS-CoV-2 spread among children during this time. However, seroprevalence increased sharply in Wave 5 to approximately 25&#x0025;. Waves 4 and 5 were approximately three months apart and included the winter holidays, when children were outside the controlled school setting, and the corresponding nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases. Our data confirm that the surge also impacted the pediatric population, correlating with a large increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2-exposed children.</p>
<p>It is well appreciated that underrepresented racial and ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> We found that Hispanic children were more likely to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to white children in all waves. Similarly, black children were more likely to have antibodies than white children in Wave 3 and Wave 5. The increase in SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Hispanic and black children corresponded to an increase in antibody level in Hispanic and black adults during the same timeframe.(REF-Kennedy preprint) Higher antibody prevalence in Hispanic and black children may reflect multiple socioeconomic factors, including income inequality, economic stability, work circumstances, and housing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> Hispanic and black parents may be less likely to hold jobs that allow them to work remotely, which increases their potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace and limits their ability to utilize remote learning or in home childcare to decrease their children&#x2019;s SARS-CoV-2 exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Residing with parents with a higher risk of workplace SARS-CoV-2 exposure combined with increased school/daycare attendance could drive infection rates in minority children. Our results underscore that the pandemic exacerbated existing racial and ethnic disparities.</p>
<p>Our data also highlight the importance of vaccinating children against SARS-CoV-2. General vaccinations in Arkansas began in January 2021 for those over 18 years and, and were expanded to 16 years and older on March 30, 2021.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> The CDC&#x2019;s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 12-15 year-olds on May 10, 2021.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Wave 5 samples were collected in April 2021, after the expansion of vaccinations to those 16 years and up but prior to inclusion of 12-15 year-olds. Only 8 of 145 total 16-18 year-olds in reported being vaccinated during Wave 5 and no subjects reported full vaccination at least two weeks prior to sample collection. Thus, our data reflect the pediatric seroprevalence rate in Arkansas prior to widespread vaccination efforts in children and adolescents. As authorization to vaccinate children younger than 12 years will not occur until late 2021, our findings indicate that most children in Arkansas remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection entering the 2021&#x2013;2022 school year. Importantly, we found that the seroprevalence rate in younger children was lower than for older children and adolescents, which strongly emphasizes the ongoing risk of infection for a vulnerable part of the population that cannot yet be vaccinated. This is a critical consideration for policy makers as more infectious variants emerge that exhibit increased infection and likelihood of causing sever disease in younger portions of the population.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Remnant serum samples may not provide an accurate representation of the Arkansas population. The strengths and limitations of convenience samples are described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> As our study samples were collected from health clinics, our sampling method may favor subjects who were more ill or more willing to seek health care. It is possible that our seroprevalence rates are overestimated due to potential cross reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 antigens and seasonal coronaviruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> Some uninfected individuals, particularly children and adolescents, have antibodies that react with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> Further, we measured a combination of IgM and IgG antibody isotypes, as opposed to testing solely for IgG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> Although studies indicate that IgG and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 can develop simultaneously, some individuals develop detectable IgM and IgG antibodies at different times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> Consequently, we may identify individuals with IgM and/or IgG, whereas other assays may only identify specimens with IgG. IgM also can be more non-specific than IgG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> Together, these limitations may cause an overestimation of antibody reactivity. However, inclusion of multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the BSA control limit the non-specific reactions detected in our assay.</p>

<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>Analysis of remnant samples collected from children and adolescents in Arkansas demonstrate a steady increase in SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 8 months of the pandemic, followed by a more rapid increase to 25&#x0025; by the end of April 2021. This finding is notable, as it is more than twice the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses in the state on the final collection date. No obvious comorbidities were identified for seropositivity in children. Racial and ethnic disparities exist, with Hispanic and black children being at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to white children. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infections in children are more common than previously recognized. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, recognition of long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 even after mild or asymptomatic infections, and the lack of an authorized pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, these results highlight the importance of including children in SARS-CoV-2 public health, clinical care, and research strategies. Until vaccines are approved for those under 12 years, it is important that protective measures are enacted, particularly in settings where children are grouped together, to limit the risk of infection, super-spreader events, severe disease, long-term sequelae, and death. This is especially true in states like Arkansas with low vaccination rates, which is currently experiencing a new surge in infections and hospitalizations in younger age-groups caused by more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>
