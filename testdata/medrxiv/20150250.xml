<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Here, we develop a simple molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). The test has two steps: 1) prepare saliva with heat and a stabilization solution, and 2) detect virus by incubating with a primer and enzyme mix at 65&#x00B0;C for 30 minutes. After incubation, saliva samples containing the SARS-CoV-2 genome turn bright yellow, while the negative samples remain pink. Because this test is pH dependent, it can react falsely to naturally acidic human saliva. Here, we report unique buffering conditions and protocols that rendered 295 healthy human saliva samples compatible with the test, producing zero false positives. We also evaluated the test on 168 saliva samples from individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and from 47 matched pairs of saliva and anterior nasal samples from infected individuals. The Saliva TwoStep test described here reliably identified infected individuals with 94&#x0025; sensitivity and >99&#x0025; specificity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Screening is one of the most basic and powerful tools in the public health arsenal. Screening tests identify underlying illness in apparently healthy or asymptomatic individuals. RT-LAMP is a simple nucleic acid diagnostic concept that has existed for more than 20 years and is used in diverse and even remote settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. RT-LAMP utilizes loop forming primers and strand-displacement polymerases to achieve isothermal amplification of a target RNA template. Therefore, the reaction does not require a thermal cycler, which is a key advantage in keeping screening pipelines from burdening diagnostic pipelines. Successful amplification in RT-LAMP reactions can be directly visualized via various visual indicators, including by phenol red which changes the color in the reaction tube upon successful amplification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. RT-LAMP assays 1) are specific because they employ four to six primers for each amplification reaction, which in principle reduces off-target effects when compared to PCR, 2) are robust in that they can produce on the order of 10<sup>9</sup> copies of the target in an hour-long reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, and 3) can be performed anywhere because they simply require pipettors and a heating source (e.g. water baths, heat blocks, or thermal cyclers) as equipment. In addition, recent studies have shown that saliva has high diagnostic value for SARS-CoV-2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Overall, a rapid screening test that combines the simplicity of RT-LAMP and the non-invasive nature of saliva would satisfy the criteria for an effective screening test.</p>
<p>To date, a few studies have attempted to develop RT-LAMP tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, RT-LAMP can have a high rate of false positives <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Here, we present an optimized RT-LAMP screening procedure that detects SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid present in saliva directly, without any need for RNA purification. We optimized buffering and stabilization conditions that neutralize the variability of human saliva and eliminate false positives. We validated the RT-LAMP test using a large cohort of saliva and matched nasal swab specimens collected from our local university population, comparing the test to two other SARS-CoV-2 tests (one nasal test and one saliva test). We found our optimized RT-LAMP procedure performs consistently with high specificity and sensitivity.</p>

<title>Optimized saliva buffering conditions for RT-LAMP</title>
<p>In colorimetric RT-LAMP, phenol red serves as the visual indicator for nucleic acid amplification. Reactions start as pink/red but turn strongly yellow at pH 6.8 and below. When RT-LAMP amplifies a target, it causes a massive drop in pH within the tube to pH 6.0 &#x2013; 6.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, triggering the color change to yellow. Human saliva naturally varies in pH between 6.8 and 7.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, posing a significant problem in this pH-dependent assay. In fact, we find about 10&#x0025; of human saliva samples are naturally acidic enough to immediately trigger phenol red-containing reactions to change to yellow without any target amplification required. If acidic samples are not anticipated and managed, colorimetric RT-LAMP has the potential to produce a high false-positive rate.</p>
<p>To address this issue, we optimized a basic saliva stabilization solution by titrating in various concentrations of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). We performed this optimization using a control RT-LAMP primer set, &#x201C;RNaseP,&#x201D; which amplifies the mRNA transcript produced from the human <italic>POP7</italic> gene (primer set developed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>). Our goal was to increase the pH of all saliva samples well above the indicator flip-point of pH 6.8, while not making the samples so basic that they couldn&#x2019;t reach this pH upon successful target amplification. We found that human saliva containing 14.5 mM NaOH is optimal to inhibit false positives caused by saliva acidity without impeding the intended color change during amplification (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). We designed our saliva stabilization solution to also include a chelating agent (1 mM EDTA final concentration) and Proteinase K to inhibit RNases, both of which help preserve virion RNA and therefore to increase sensitivity. (Note that Proteinase K will inhibit the RT-LAMP reaction if it does not go through a heat inactivation step prior to that reaction.) Finally, the saliva stabilization solution contains TCEP, which aids in RNA stabilization by breaking disulfide bonds present in RNases and helping to reduce saliva viscosity. Our optimized saliva stabilization solution (2X solution: 5 mM TCEP, 2 mM EDTA, 29 mM NaOH, 100 &#x03BC;g/mL Proteinase K, diluted in DEPC-treated water) is key to this test and we find that it rendered all saliva samples tested (n=463) robust to colorimetric RT-LAMP. For additional advice on controlling the acidity of reactions, which is key to reducing false positives in RT-LAMP, see <bold>Supplemental Text S1</bold>.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Optimized RT-LAMP primer sets for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in human saliva</title>
<p>A critical parameter in RT-LAMP is primer design because RT-LAMP requires 4-6 primers all working together <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. We found that the &#x201C;AS1E&#x201D; set, developed by Rabe et. al. and targeting the <italic>ORF1ab</italic> region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, performs well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, in order to target two distinct regions from the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we designed and tested a large number of additional primer sets. Two of our custom sets, &#x201C;ORF1e&#x201D; targeting the virus <italic>ORF1ab</italic> gene, and &#x201C;N2&#x201D; targeting the virus <italic>N</italic> gene, exhibited similar sensitivity and amplification efficiency as the AS1E set, as determined using real-time fluorescence monitoring of RT-LAMP products (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). We next confirmed that these primer sets were both compatible with saliva preserved in our saliva stabilization solution and with colorimetric RT-LAMP (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p><bold>A)</bold> Three RT-LAMP primer sets targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome (AS1E, ORF1e, and N2) were tested with real-time RT-LAMP. Saliva was mixed 1:1 with 2X saliva stabilization solution, heated at 95&#x00B0;C for 10 minutes, and then <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RNA was spiked in at the indicated concentrations. 4 &#x03BC;l was added to a master mix containing primers and NEB&#x2019;s WarmStart LAMP 2x Master Mix in a final reaction volume of 20 &#x03BC;l. Reactions were incubated at 65&#x00B0;C and a fluorescence reading was taken every 30 seconds. EvaGreen was used to monitor amplification products in real-time (X-axis) using a QuantStudio3 quantitative PCR machine. There are 9 lines for each of the three primer sets because three concentrations of spiked in SARS-CoV-2 RNA were each tested in triplicate (0, 400, 800 copies / &#x03BC;l saliva).

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Addressing biosafety concerns of sample handing</title>
<p>Next, we addressed the biosafety concerns of handling samples. Recent studies suggest that incubation for 3 minutes at 95&#x00B0;C is sufficient to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, when heating saliva samples for downstream analysis of RNA, one must balance heating long enough to liberate the target RNA from virions with not heating for so long that the target RNA will be degraded. Heating at 95 &#x00B0;C does degrade SARS-2-CoV RNA that is spiked directly into saliva samples but does not degrade viral RNA when it is spiked into samples within SARS-CoV-2 virions (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S1</xref></bold>). A 10-minute incubation of saliva samples at 95&#x00B0;C was found to be optimal (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S1</xref></bold>). We designed our test procedure such that testing personnel avoid handling open tubes until after this step to increase biosafety.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Assessment of sample stability</title>
<p>Stability of saliva samples from the time of collection to the time of processing and analysis is important if testing cannot be performed immediately, or if the tests are being conducted in batches. Saliva samples containing purified virions and diluted with 2X saliva stabilization solution were stored at 4&#x00B0;C for 24, 48, or 96 hours before being inactivated at 95&#x00B0;C and analyzed using colorimetric RT-LAMP (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S2</xref></bold>). We tested saliva collection and storage over a range of SARS-CoV-2 virion spike-in concentrations. We observed no significant changes in sample stability over this time course, suggesting that saliva samples stored in saliva stabilization solution at 4&#x00B0;C are stable for at least four days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Determining the limit of detection</title>
<p>We next sought to carefully evaluate the limit of detection for this test. The lowest concentration at which positive samples were reliably identified was 200 virions/&#x03BC;L in saliva (red box, summary table in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). We next tested 20 replicates at this concentration (200 virions/&#x03BC;L) using all four primer sets (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). The ORF1e primer set was not consistent in its performance at 200 virions/&#x03BC;L. Therefore, we decided to eliminate the ORF1e primer set from our testing panel and define a final colorimetric RT-LAMP test that includes primer sets RNaseP, AS1E, and N2. Note that the limit of detection refers to the virus concentration that can be identified > 95&#x0025; of the time, and the assay does sometimes detect the virus at even lower concentrations.</p>

The table at the bottom shows a summary of positive reactions (yellow). Red box indicates our selection of primer sets to advance to subsequent analysis.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="20150250v2_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We next performed a blinded study. Heat-inactivated virions were spiked into human saliva at various concentrations at or above the limit of detection, and these as well as uninfected saliva samples were blinded and passed to a second member of our personnel. After running the RT-LAMP test on 60 such samples, only one positive sample did not score correctly. In that sample the SARS-CoV-2 primer set N2 failed (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S3</xref></bold>). All negative samples were scored correctly (100&#x0025; specificity, binomial 95&#x0025; confidence interval [88&#x0025;,100&#x0025;]). Conservatively counting the inconclusive test as a false negative lead to a sensitivity estimate of 97&#x0025; (binomial 95&#x0025; confidence interval [93&#x0025;,100&#x0025;]). See <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold> for a breakdown by primer set.</p>

<p><bold>A)</bold> Human saliva samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 using quantitative RT-PCR method. The remaining saliva was mixed 1:1 with 2X saliva stabilization solution and re-tested using RT-LAMP.

<title>Evaluation on human samples</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 screening was initiated on the University of Colorado Boulder campus starting in the summer/fall of 2020. Saliva samples were taken weekly from residents of dormitories and at several testing sites throughout the campus. Participants were asked to refrain from eating or drinking 30 minutes prior to sample collection, though we expect this may not have been universally followed. All saliva samples were first analyzed by a published quantitative RT-PCR method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and so each sample is matched with a Ct value from this test. During campus testing, 295 negative samples, and 168 positive samples with viral loads at or above our limit of detection (200 virions/&#x03BC;L) were also evaluated with the Saliva TwoStep test described here. These samples had already been heat inactivated for 30 minutes at 95&#x00B0;C as the initial step of the quantitative RT-PCR protocol. Since the heating component of our Saliva Preparation step had already been performed, an aliquot of the sample was transferred into our 2X saliva stabilization solution (without Proteinase K) and then put through the RT-LAMP reaction as described above. For each of the 463 samples, three reactions were performed with different primer sets: RNaseP (positive control), AS1E, and N2 primer sets (the latter two sets detecting SARS-CoV-2). During this part of the study, we noticed that decreasing the input sample amount from 4 &#x03BC;L to 2 &#x03BC;L in a total reaction volume of 20 &#x03BC;L further increases tolerance of the RT-LAMP reaction color to acidic saliva samples because less saliva is added. We thus reduced the input sample amount to 2 &#x03BC;L when evaluating these human samples. For all 463 samples, RT-LAMP with primers to human RNA positive control (RNaseP) turned positive (yellow).</p>
<sec id="s2f1">
<title>Specificity</title>
<p>295 saliva samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative RT-PCR were used for evaluation. We re-tested all of those samples with Saliva TwoStep to evaluate our false-positive rate. Remarkably, for all 295 SARS-CoV-2-negative samples, AS1E and N2 primers sets both universally returned a result of negative, consistent with the quantitative RT-PCR results. Therefore, there were zero false positives and the test has a specificity of 100&#x0025; in this extensive sample set. This shows the strength of our saliva stabilization solution, which mitigates the problem of false-positives in RT-LAMP due to some human saliva samples being naturally acidic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f2">
<title>Sensitivity</title>
<p>We next analyzed 168 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples with viral loads above the limit of detection of our assay. We determined the relative viral load of each positive saliva samples based on the reported Ct values and the quantitative RT-PCR standard curve (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S4</xref></bold>). Of these samples, 158 (94&#x0025;; AS1E primers) or 142 (85&#x0025;; N2 primers) returned positive RT-LAMP test results (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). In <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>, we summarize the performance of both primer sets in both this test of human saliva samples and in the spiked in virion experiments described above (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure S3</xref></bold>). The observed limit of detection of the AS1E primer set was determined from this data to be 266 virions/microliter. The strong congruence with our prior estimate of 200 virions/microliter demonstrates that heating for 30 minutes prior to adding stabilization solution and using 2 &#x00B5;L of saliva instead of 4 &#x00B5;L both have very little effect. Because the AS1E primer set performs best throughout our study, we include that as the main primer set in the Saliva TwoStep test. However, the N2 primer set still performs well and can be used when it is desirable to detect a second region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f3">
<title>Test sensitivity as a function of viral load in the sample</title>
<p>For both primer sets, we calculated the sensitivity (positive agreement with quantitative RT-PCR) and specificity (negative agreement with quantitative RT-PCR) of the RT-LAMP test at various levels of viral load cutoffs (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). The differences in the observed limit of detection between the two SARS-CoV-2 primer sets could reflect the differences in the primer efficiencies, as well as the dynamics in relative viral transcript abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Assessment of Saliva TwoStep against an EUA approved nasal swab test</title>
<p>For 169 of the SARS-CoV-2-positive saliva samples analyzed above, 47 also had matched nasal samples collected no more than two days later. We next compared the results of the Saliva TwoStep test with the result obtained by the Quidel Lrya nasal swab RT-PCR test.</p>
<p>The RT-LAMP produced one false negative in this sample set, whereas the Lyra test produced three (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). However, this is still remarkably consistent given that this comparison involves three degrees of freedom: biosample (saliva versus nasal swab), test modality (RT-PCR versus RT-LAMP), and days between saliva and nasal samples collection (up to two days apart).

<p><bold>Upper half) Step 1: Prepare Saliva</bold>. Person provides 1 mL of saliva, and 1 mL of 2X saliva stabilization solution is then added to it. (This sample can be processed immediately or stored in the refrigerator at 4&#x00B0;C for at least 4 days.) The mixture is heated at 95&#x00B0;C for 10 minutes. This step serves to neutralize the pH of saliva, liberate viral RNA from virions in the saliva, and inactivate virions for safe handling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> (although appropriate safety precautions should always be taken). We have determined that performing a heating step at 95&#x00B0;C for 30 minutes before addition of the saliva stabilization solution also works equally well. However, in this case Proteinase K must be left out of that solution.</p>
<p><bold>Lower half) Step 2: Detect Virus</bold>. 2 &#x03BC;L of stabilized saliva from step 1 is pipetted into each of three test tubes pre-filled with the RT-LAMP master mix and primers. The only thing different between the three tubes is the primer set included, with each set targeting either the human positive control RNA or a region of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, as indicated. After incubation, the reaction will turn from pink to yellow if the target RNA is present in saliva. An example of a positive and a negative test are shown.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are several advantages to the SARS-CoV-2 Saliva TwoStep RT-LAMP screening approach described here: <bold>1)</bold> The use of saliva sample eliminates invasive nasal swab-based sampling, which requires special supplies and causes discomfort. <bold>2)</bold> We optimized saliva stabilization solution that allows for the neutralization of a broad range of naturally acidic saliva samples while maintaining compatibility with a colorimetric RT-LAMP assay. We did not obtain a single false positive. The solution also helps preserve saliva samples for at least four days before processing. <bold>3)</bold> We determined the optimal sample heating condition that liberates the host and viral RNA with minimal degradation. The simple heating step increases biosafety and avoids formal RNA extraction procedures. <bold>4)</bold> For RT-LAMP, we incorporated additional primers based on up-do-date SARS-CoV-2 genome databases and identified primers allowing efficient target amplification. <bold>5)</bold> Overall, with the simplified two steps of saliva preparation and virus detection, the test has a rapid sample-to-result turnaround time of 45 minutes. Through the optimization process, we realized the potential sources of false positive results and provided a detailed summary for troubleshooting (<bold>Methods and Supplemental Text S1</bold>). By strictly following these application notes, we completely avoided false positive results during the evaluation of a large cohort of human saliva samples, achieving 100&#x0025; specificity. We also evaluated the RT-LAMP test performance based on the experimentally-determined limit of detection. Using SARS-CoV-2 positive human saliva samples, we confirmed that the RT-LAMP test can consistently identify infected individuals with 94&#x0025; sensitivity.</p>
<p>Based on these observations, we conclude that the Saliva TwoStep described herein can be used as a SARS-CoV-2 screening tool to reliably identify highly infective individuals with minimal laboratory setup, potentially serving as a tool for effective SARS-CoV-2 surveillance at the community level. This RT-LAMP testing offers many solutions to a nation-wide shortage of COVID-19 testing. Combined with the protocol presented here that enables the use of saliva samples, this rapid community testing would provide more frequent tests to those who face the risk of transmission every day, but who would not have the time or resources to seek tests in a clinical setting. With minimal set-up this test could be performed in diverse settings such as factories, office buildings, or schools.</p>

<title>RT-LAMP primer design and preparation</title>
<p>Regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that are conserved among strains were identified using genome diversity data from NextStrain (<underline>nextstrain.org/ncov/global</underline>). Next, nucleotide-BLAST (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) was used to filter out genome sequences that share high sequence homology with other seasonal coronavirus genomes. Finally, PrimerExplorer V5 (<underline>primerexplorer.jp/e/</underline>) was used to design RT-LAMP primers targeting the specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The F3, B3, FIP, BIP, Loop F and Loop B primers were selected for optimal melting temperature and complementarity using A plasmid editor (ApE). All primers were ordered from IDT in desalted form. In all cases, a 10X concentration of primer sets was made containing 16 &#x03BC;M FIP and BIP primers, 4 &#x03BC;M LF and LB primers, and 2 &#x03BC;M F3 and B3 primers.</p>
<p>All primers should be ordered with HPLC purification, which ensures the yield and avoids cross contamination from other SARS-CoV-2-related synthesis projects being run on the same equipment at the oligo synthesis facilities (which can lead to false positives). This is particularly a problem during a pandemic where these facilities are handling many oligo synthesis orders focused on the same pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. It is also recommended that you communicate with the primer synthesis company to inform them that primers are intended for use with a SARS-CoV-2 screening test. Several companies have dedicated facilities for minimizing cross-contamination of SARS-CoV-2 templates. In addition, primers should be diluted in nucleus-free water, instead of Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer, which will also inhibit pH change that takes place during RT-LAMP.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 RNA and virion standards</title>
<p>Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA control (Twist Bioscience #102019) was obtained and its copy number of 1&#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> copies/&#x03BC;l was confirmed using RT-qPCR in conjunction with a DNA plasmid control containing a region of the N gene from the SARS-CoV-2 genome (IDT #10006625). Heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virion control (ATCC #VR-1986HK) was obtained and its concentration of 3.75&#x00D7;10<sup>5</sup> virions/&#x03BC;l was confirmed using RT-qPCR in conjunction with both the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA control and a DNA plasmid control containing a region of the N gene from the SARS-CoV-2 genome. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was added to saliva samples after being mixed 1:1 with saliva stabilization solution and heated at 95&#x00B0;C for 10 minutes, unless stated otherwise, whereas heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions were added to saliva samples and mixed 1:1 with saliva stabilization solution before being heated. Concentrations reported throughout this study represent the final concentration of standards in saliva before it was mixed 1:1 with 2X saliva stabilization solution.</p>

<title>Saliva preparation with heat and stabilization solution</title>
<p>When making the 2X saliva stabilization solution, we offer several key pointers: 1) Use TCEP-HCl (GoldBio #TCEP10). The -HCL form must be used to produce the correct final stock pH. 2) Use EDTA, 0.5 M, pH 8.0 (Sigma-Aldrich #324506). It is important to use a pH 8.0 stock solution, otherwise this also affect the pH of the final stabilization solution. 3) Use lyophilized Proteinase K (Roche # 3115879001). It is important to use the lyophilized form. Liquid forms will contain Tris, which inhibits the pH change during the RT-LAMP reaction. 4) 10 M NaOH was prepared by dissolving NaOH pellets (Sigma-Aldrich #221465) into nuclease-free water, before being added to the 2X solution to reach the correct concentration. The following is the exact recipe that we used to create a 100mL stock of 2X saliva stabilization solution:</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Saliva samples (1 mL) were collected in sterile, nuclease-free 5 mL conical screw-cap tubes (TLD Five-O # TLDC2540). 2X saliva stabilization solution described above was then added at a 1:1 ratio. Samples were shaken vigorously for 5 -10 seconds and incubated at 95&#x00B0;C for 10 minutes. Samples were then placed on ice before being used in downstream analyses.</p>

<title>Real-time RT-LAMP</title>
<p>For each reaction, 10 &#x03BC;L WarmStart LAMP 2X Master Mix (NEB #E1700) was combined with 1 &#x03BC;L 20X EvaGreen Dye (Biotium #31000), 2 &#x03BC;l 10X primer mix, and 3 &#x03BC;l DEPC-treated water. The combined reaction mix was added to MicroAmp Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate (ThermoFisher #N8010560) and then 4 &#x03BC;l processed saliva sample was added. The reaction was mixed using a multi-channel pipette and incubated in Applied Biosystems QuantStudio3 Real-time PCR system. The reaction proceeded at 65&#x00B0;C for 30 minutes with fluorescent signal being captured every 30 seconds.

<title>Colorimetric RT-LAMP</title>
<p>WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix (NEB #M1800) was used in all colorimetric RT-LAMP reactions. Each reaction was carried out in a total of 20 &#x03BC;l (10 &#x03BC;l WarmStart Master Mix, 2 &#x03BC;l 10X primer mix, 4 &#x03BC;l processed saliva sample, and 4 &#x03BC;l DEPC-treated water). Reactions were set up in PCR strip tubes on ice. Saliva template was added last and tubes were inverted several times to mix samples and briefly spun down in a microfuge. Reactions were incubated in a thermal cycler at 65&#x00B0;C for 30 minutes and then deactivated at 80&#x00B0;C for 2 minutes. The incubation was carried out without the heated lid to simulate a less complex heating device. Images of reactions were taken using a smartphone. For the community deployment of this assay, 2 &#x03BC;l of processed saliva was used instead of 4 &#x03BC;l.</p>

<title>Testing of University Samples</title>
<p>For sample collection conducted at our university, individuals are asked to collect no less than 0.5 mL of saliva into a 5 mL screw-top collection tube. Saliva samples were heated at 95&#x00B0;C for 30 minutes to inactivate the viral particles for safe handling, and then placed on ice or at 4&#x00B0;C.</p>
<p>For quantitative RT-PCR analysis, the university testing team transferred 75 &#x03BC;L of saliva into a 96-well plate where each well had been pre-loaded with 75 &#x03BC;L TBE buffer supplemented with 0.5&#x0025; Tween 20. (The remaining saliva in the 5 mL collection tube proceeded to RT-LAMP testing as described in the next paragraph.) 5 &#x03BC;L of the diluted sample was then added to a separate 96-well plate containing 15 &#x03BC;L reaction mix composed of: TaqPath 1-step Multiplex Master Mix (Thermo Fisher A28523), triplex primer mix consisting of: nCOV_N2 forward and reverse primers from IDT (10006833 and 10006834) at 600 nM final concentration, nCOV_N2 (SUN) Probe (10007049) at 300 nM final concentration, E_Sarbeco_F1 forward and E_Sarbeco_R2 reverse primers (10006888 and 10006890) at 400 nM final concentration, E_Sarbeco_P1 (FAM) Probe (10006893) at 200 nM final concentration, RNaseP forward and reverse primers (10006836 and 10006837) at 50 nM final concentration and RNaseP (ATTO&#x2122;647) Probe (10007062) also at 50 nM final concentration, and nuclease-free water. The reactions were mixed, spun down, and loaded onto a Bio-Rad CFX96 or CFX384 qPCR machine. Quantitative RT-PCR was run using the standard mode, consisting of a hold stage (25&#x00B0;C for 2 minutes, 50&#x00B0;C for 15 minutes, and 95&#x00B0;C for 2 minutes) followed by 44 cycles of a PCR stage (95&#x00B0;C for 3 seconds, 55&#x00B0;C for 30 seconds, with a 1.6&#x00B0;C/sec ramp up and ramp down rate). In the study herein, Ct values from the nCOV_N2 primer set are used.</p>
<p>Leftover samples from this testing procedure were then tested with RT-LAMP. 50 &#x03BC;l of saliva samples was transferred and mixed into a 96-well plate, pre-loaded with 50 &#x03BC;l 2X saliva stabilization solution without proteinase K (5 mM TCEP-HCL, 2 mM EDTA, 29 mM NaOH, diluted in DEPC-treated water). 2 &#x03BC;L of diluted saliva samples were transferred into 8-strip PCR tubes containing RT-LAMP reaction mixture (enzymes and primers). For each sample, three RT-LAMP reactions were carried out to amplify human RNaseP as a control and AS1E and N2 for SARS-CoV-2. The reactions were incubated at 65&#x00B0;C for 30 minutes followed by inactivation at 80&#x00B0;C for 2 minutes on a thermal cycler (Bio-RAD T100). A color change from pink to yellow was observed visually to interpret results.</p>

Without heating, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected with RT-LAMP, presumably because virions remain intact and the viral RNA is not accessible by the amplification enzymes. Amplification is somewhat inconsistent at 5 and 30 minutes possibly because at 5 minutes hardly any RNA has been liberated, and by 30 minutes it has been largely degraded. However, 10 or 15 minutes at 95&#x00B0;C appears to provide just the right balance between liberating and preserving RNA. All reactions contain the AS1E primer set.

<title>Controlling acidic and variable human saliva samples</title>
<p>We found that the biggest obstacle to implementing the colorimetric RT-LAMP assay is the variability in the reaction pH condition. First, false-positive signal can result from saliva samples that are naturally acidic. We spent significant time addressing this issue and ultimately found that all samples must be over-buffered towards basic conditions in order to set the correct threshold for specificity in the test. This was achieved through a titration series of sodium hydroxide in the saliva stabilization solution to find the optimal concentration that would ensure all RT-LAMP reactions start pink and are still capable of turning yellow if amplification occurs. However, note that other components in the saliva stabilization solution (EDTA, pH=8.0, and TCEP-HCl) have also played a role in establishing the optimal pH. Additional saliva stabilization solution optimization might be needed if other forms of these components are used. Second, the colorimetric RT-LAMP reaction relies on phenol red to detect the pH change during the amplification. Any additional buffering agents, such as tris-acetate or tris-borate that are commonly present in laboratory reagents, should be avoided to prevent potential false negative signals, as these buffering agents tend to inhibit the pH change.</p>

<title>Controlling reaction acidification by carbonic acid</title>
<p>A second issue that has to be carefully controlled is the exposure of reaction components to the surrounding environment. When carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in water, it creates carbonic acid, which if present in high enough quantities can trigger the phenol red to turn yellow regardless of reaction state. Control measures should be implemented in three ways: First, we advise preparing the reaction mix (RT-LAMP master mix, primers, and water) right before sample loading. This is to prevent background amplification as well as the acidification of the reaction mix due to exposure to air. Additionally, dry ice should be avoided or completely isolated from the reaction components during sample transportation, as the exposure to the excessive carbon dioxide could also lead to acidification of the reaction mix. Second, during the 30-minute 65&#x00B0;C incubation, it is essential to completely seal off the reaction tubes to prevent vaporization of the reaction mix, as well as the infiltration of the water vapor if a water bath is used. We have noticed that an incomplete seal could lead to false positive signals. Last, because RT-LAMP amplification is highly robust, the test is very sensitive to contamination. Therefore, opening of reaction tubes after RT-LAMP has occurred should be strictly avoided as these tubes contain a large amount of target DNA. Alternatively, the NEB WarmStart LAMP 2X Master Mix with UDG (NEB M1804) can be used to eliminate DNA contamination. Through these results are not shown, we have verified the same limit of detection can be reach using this alternative master mix.</p>

<title>Controlling laboratory-based contamination</title>
<p>When carrying out the RT-LAMP SARS-CoV-2 screening test at scale, it is critical to assign isolated workstations, each containing their own set of laboratory equipment such as pipettes, centrifuges, vortexes, and cleaning supplies. This equipment should never move between stations and be regularly decontaminated using a detergent based cleaning solution such as 10&#x0025; bleach or any other commercially available solution designed to eliminated nucleic acid contaminants. Additionally, special care should be taken by laboratory staff to regularly replace gloves if moving <italic>backwards</italic> from the following workstations:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7k">
<title>Workstation 1: Setting up master mixes</title>
<p>This workstation is dedicated to making and aliquoting the master mix containing the RT-LAMP enzymes, primers, and water. All reagents should be centrifuged and spun down after thawing. As mentioned above, master mix should be made and aliquoted shortly before addition of saliva (Workstation 2) to avoid carbon dioxide solubilization due to atmospheric exposure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7l">
<title>Workstation 2: Adding saliva samples to aliquoted RT-LAMP reaction tubes</title>
<p>This workstation is dedicated to handling the processed saliva samples. Once saliva samples are added to the aliquoted RT-LAMP reaction tubes, care should be taken to ensure that an appropriate seal is established (e.g. dome cap strips) to minimize airflow during reaction incubation. This workstation should include two micropipettes capable of pipetting a volume of 2 &#x00B5;l. One pipette can be used for saliva samples, while the other pipette should be used exclusively for pipetting any RNA controls (e.g. <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RNA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7m">
<title>Workstation 3: RT-LAMP reaction incubation and results reporting</title>
<p>This workstation contains the heating element (e.g. heat block, thermal cycler) where RT-LAMP reactions are incubated. This Workstation has the highest risk of contamination, since the RT-LAMP reaction products will be in high abundance and can themselves serve as a template in subsequent reactions. When reactions are removed from the heating element, they should immediately be analyzed, results recorded, and then reaction tubes should be disposed in a container with a lid. <italic>Never carry completed reaction tubes to any other part of the lab. Never open completed reaction tubes for any reason</italic>. Any laboratory technician that has entered Workstation 3 should dispose of their gloves before returning to any other part of the lab.</p>
