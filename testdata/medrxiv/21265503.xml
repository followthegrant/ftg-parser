<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Objective</title>
<p>The current study examined patterns in COVID-19 testing and vaccination intentions across multiple language groups in Greater Western Sydney, Australia.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Participants completed a cross-sectional survey available from March 21 to July 9, 2021 in Sydney, Australia. Surveys were available in English or translated (11 languages). Participants could complete surveys independently or with support from bilingual staff. Logistic regression models using post-stratification weighted frequencies identified factors associated with testing and vaccination intentions.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Most of the 708 participants (88&#x0025;, n=622) were not born in Australia; 31&#x0025; reported that they did not speak English well or at all (n=220); 70&#x0025; had no tertiary qualifications (n=497); and 41&#x0025; had inadequate health literacy (n=290). Most participants reported high testing intention (77.2&#x0025;, n=546), with differences observed across language groups (p&#x003C;0.001). The most frequently reported barrier to testing was concerns about infection at the clinic (26.1&#x0025;). Half (53.0&#x0025;) reported willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine if recommended to them (n=375); 18&#x0025; were unwilling (n=127), and the remainder unsure (29&#x0025;, n=205). These proportions varied significantly by language group (p&#x003C;0.001). Participants were more likely to be unwilling/hesitant if they were female (p=0.02) or did not use Australian commercial information sources (p=0.01). Concerns about side effects (30.4&#x0025;, n=102) and safety (23.9&#x0025;, n=80), were key reported barriers to vaccination.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Different language groups have unique and specific needs to support uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Health services must work collaboratively with culturally and linguistically diverse communities to provide tailored support to encourage COVID-19 testing and vaccination.</p></sec>

<p>In 2021, vaccination became the main COVID-19 management strategy to enable countries to ease restrictions, open up the economy, and protect those who are most vulnerable from serious consequences of the virus(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Australian Government, 2021b</xref>). In Australia COVID-19 vaccine rollout began in February 2021 and is underway at the time of writing. During the rollout, testing for COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat) continues to be another important management strategy. Testing and subsequent contact tracing of positive cases provides essential data about where, when, and how the virus is spreading, and informs decisions about how to contain outbreaks (e.g. through short-term localised restriction of movement).</p>
<p>In Australia, at the time of writing, COVID-19 vaccines were not mandatory. Australia has taken a state-based and phased approach to rollout, with eligibility focusing initially on frontline healthcare workers, older people, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and people with specified pre-existing underlying medical conditions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Australian Government Department of Health, 2020</xref>). Two vaccines were available at the time of the study: Pfizer (Comirnaty) and AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria), although the supply of Pfizer was much more limited. Though both are widely used and accepted internationally in countries such as the UK, the AstraZeneca vaccine has drawn media attention due to a very small increased risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (a side effect that can have serious consequences), and reports of poorer vaccine effectiveness compared to Pfizer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Picheta, 2021</xref>). This, coupled with the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI)&#x2019;s changing advice about Pfizer as the &#x2018;preferred vaccine&#x2019; for certain age groups likely reduced community willingness to get the AstraZeneca vaccine in the first half of 2021, which slowed the rollout because it was the only option available to many community members at that time(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Leask et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Australian nationally representative surveys suggest that in the lead up to the vaccine rollout in February 2021, 73&#x0025; of Australians agreed that they would get a COVID-19 vaccination when it is available and recommended to them(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021a</xref>). By April and May this was 68&#x0025;, returning to 73&#x0025; in June(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021b</xref>). Our Australia-wide surveys in April and November 2020, before vaccines became available, suggested that main barriers to COVID-19 vaccination included concerns about the vaccines&#x2019; safety, distrust of the government or the vaccine, and needing more information(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dodd et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dodd et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dodd et al., 2020b</xref>). No differences in vaccine intention were observed for people who spoke a language other than English at home, though people with lower health literacy and less education had lower vaccine intentions. This finding is consistent with another nationally representative survey (sample recruited August 2020)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Edwards et al., 2021</xref>). However, it should be noted that these surveys did not adequately engage culturally and linguistically diverse communities in Australia, who were underrepresented in these samples. As such, there is only limited Australian research about COVID-19 vaccine intentions and barriers in these communities.</p>
<p>Since April 24<sup>th</sup> 2020, all Australians have been encouraged to get tested for COVID-19 if they experience even mild symptoms. However nationally representative surveys estimate that the proportion of Australians reporting that they would definitely get a COVID-19 test if they had mild respiratory infection symptoms is relatively low, ranging between 45&#x0025; and 51&#x0025; between December 2020 and June 2021(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021b</xref>). Our survey in November 2020 highlighted that the most common barriers to testing included having symptoms but not believing it was COVID (e.g. hayfever) (15&#x0025;), preferring to self-isolate (13&#x0025;), feeling that symptoms were not severe enough (11&#x0025;), and concern that the test was painful (10&#x0025;)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bonner et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The above research provides useful data on COVID-19 attitudes and intentions in general Australian samples. However, only a small proportion of participants had inadequate health literacy or spoke a language other than English at home. This limits our capacity to understand the needs of Australian communities that are typically understudied and underserved, such as those that are culturally and linguistically diverse. This is critically important; in other countries such as the UK and the US, research indicates that COVID-19 testing rates and vaccine acceptability are often lower for people in culturally and linguistically diverse communities(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Razai et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Khubchandani and Macias, 2021</xref>), with calls to prioritise testing and vaccination efforts for these groups(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dodds and Fakoya, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Al-Oraibi et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study aimed to fill this research gap by describing patterns in COVID-19 testing intentions and vaccine willingness in a culturally and linguistically diverse sample in Sydney, Australia, during the period March 21 to July 9, 2021; and to identify key barriers to COVID-19 testing and vaccine willingness within these groups.</p>
<sec id="s1">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This study used a cross-sectional survey design. The study was approved by Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (Project number 2020/ETH03085).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from 21<sup>st</sup> March to July 9<sup>th</sup>, 2021. During this period, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout had begun across Australia, and daily cases of community transmission in NSW ranged from 0 &#x2013; 45(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">covid19data.com.au, 2021</xref>). Restrictions across Greater Sydney began on June 23<sup>rd</sup>, including limitations on the number of people allowed to visit a household, maximum number of people in an exercise class, and reduced seating capacity for outdoor events.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">NSW Health, 2021b</xref>) On the day the survey closed (July 9<sup>th</sup>) the NSW daily case count was 45, and NSW Health announced stay-at-home orders for Greater Sydney(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">NSW Health, 2021a</xref>). The survey was closed at this time despite some recruitment targets not reached so that results could be more readily interpreted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1c">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were eligible to take part if they were aged 18 or over and spoke one of the following as their main language at home: Arabic, Assyrian, Croatian, Dari, Dinka, Hindi, Khmer, Chinese, Samoan/Tongan (combined as one language &#x2018;group&#x2019;), or Spanish. We selected these ten language groups through iterative discussions with multicultural health staff, with the aim of providing broad coverage across different global regions, groups with varying average levels of English language proficiency (based on 2016 Australian census data)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016</xref>), varying access to translated materials, and varying degrees of reading skill in their main language spoken at home (Appendix 2). Each of the language groups selected was an important group within the Greater Western Sydney region (Western Sydney Local Health District, South Western Sydney Local Health District, Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District).</p>
<p>Participants were recruited through bilingual Multicultural Health staff and Health Care Interpreter Service staff. Multicultural Health staff recruited participants through their existing networks, community events and community champions. Health Care Interpreter Service staff recruited participants at the end of a medical appointment. Potential participants were offered two means of taking part: completing the survey themselves online (available in English or translated), or bilingual staff or an interpreter entered responses into the survey platform on the participants&#x2019; behalf. To ensure consistency in the phrases used for assisted survey completion, translated versions of the survey were provided to the bilingual staff and interpreters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1d">
<title>Survey design</title>
<p>Surveys were available in English or translated, and hosted on the web-based survey platform Qualtrics. Demographic survey items included age, gender, education, years living in Australia, main language spoken at home, self-reported English language proficiency, reading proficiency in language spoken at home, access to the internet, access to smartphones, chronic disease, and a single-item health literacy screener(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Wallace et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants were asked &#x201C;<italic>If I get signs of COVID-19 in the next 4 weeks (cough, sore throat, fever), the following might stop me from getting tested,&#x201D;</italic> with response options adapted from our previous survey findings(McCaffery et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bonner et al., 2021</xref>), modified to suit the Greater Western Sydney context (e.g. including responses that highlight concerns about visa status). Participants who responded &#x201C;<italic>I will get tested no matter what</italic>&#x201D; (and listed no barriers) were coded as high intention to get tested. Three additional items assessed intentions for specific testing behaviours, captured using 5-point Likert scales (strongly disagree to strongly agree). These items asked about intentions to get tested if symptomatic, to stay at home while waiting for results, and to stay home if they experience COVID-19 symptoms. Vaccine willingness was assessed by asking &#x201C;<italic>If a COVID-19 vaccine were recommended for you, would you get it&#x00E3;</italic>&#x201D; with response option &#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; &#x2018;No,&#x2019; or &#x2018;Not sure,&#x2019; as recommended by the World Health Organization for assessments of vaccine intention(Organization, 2021). Participants were not asked directly about receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine as we had anticipated recruitment would finish prior to vaccine rollout.</p>
<p>Participants were asked to specify their top 3 information sources for finding out about COVID-19 in the previous 4 weeks. Risk perception was captured by asking &#x201C;how serious a problem do you think COVID-19 is currently, in Australia&#x00E3;&#x201D; with responses ranging from 0 (not serious at all) to 10 (very serious), adapted from our previous COVID-19 surveys(McCaffery et al.).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1e">
<title>Analysis plan</title>
<p>Frequencies were weighted (using post-stratification weighting) to reflect each language group&#x2019;s gender and age group distribution (18-29 years, 30-49 years, 50-69 years, &#x2265;70 years) based on 2016 census data for the Greater Western Sydney population(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016</xref>). All summary statistics presented in the results section are weighted unless otherwise indicated. A single participant indicated their gender as &#x2018;other&#x2019; and was unable to be included in weighted analyses.</p>
<p>Logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with testing intentions and vaccine willingness, respectively. Table S3 in the Appendix presents an additional multinomial regression model that examines factors associated with the &#x2018;not sure&#x2019; and &#x2018;no&#x2019; responses to vaccination compared to &#x2018;yes&#x2019; responses; for ease of interpretation we have combined these into a binary variable (&#x2018;willing&#x2019; vs &#x2018;not sure/no&#x2019;) in the main body of the manuscript. Age group, gender, health literacy, English-language proficiency, years lived in Australia, risk perception, language group, and information sources were included in each model as these have been identified as correlates in relevant research(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Edwards et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dodd et al., 2021</xref>). The regression also controlled for socioeconomic status of area of residence (based on Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2018</xref>) deciles by postcode), and whether participants completed the survey before or after 23<sup>rd</sup> June, when new restrictions were announced for all of Greater Sydney due to a COVID-19 outbreak(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">NSW Health, 2021b</xref>). The IRSAD decile was not available for some participants (n=5), for example, because they had entered digits that did not correspond to a current or previously valid Australian postcode. IRSAD decile for these participants was replaced with the median IRSAD decile for speakers of the same language in the sample. Statistical analysis was conducted using Complex Sample procedures in IBM SPSS Statistics 26.</p>
<p>Free-text responses were analysed using content analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Weber, 1990</xref>) for the following survey item: &#x201C;<italic>So that we can understand where there are areas of concern or confusion in the community, please tell us what information you would like to know or don&#x2019;t understand about COVID-19 (including vaccination)</italic>&#x201D;. OM familiarised herself with the content and developed a list of preliminary content categories. These categories were refined through discussion with the other authors. OM and CAB coded 534 valid responses according to the final coding framework. The level of agreement was tested using 50 responses, which indicated substantial agreement (Cohen&#x2019;s &#x03BA;=0.95)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Landis and Koch, 1977</xref>). Discrepancies were discussed with JA before coding the remaining responses.</p>

<p>The mean respondent age was 45.4 years (95&#x0025; CI: 43.9 to 47.0; range 18&#x2013;91 years), and 51&#x0025; of respondents were female (n=363; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Most participants (88&#x0025;, n=622) were born in a country other than Australia; 31&#x0025; reported that they did not speak English well or at all (n=220); 70&#x0025; had no tertiary qualifications (n=497). Inadequate health literacy was identified for 41&#x0025; of the sample (n=290). Mean IRSAD decile was 4.73 (95&#x0025;CI: 4.47 to 5.00).</p>

<title>COVID-19 testing intentions</title>
<p>Overall, participants reported high intentions to get tested in the next four weeks if they experienced COVID-19 symptoms (M=4.4 out of 5, 95&#x0025; CI: 4.3 to 4.5), stay home while waiting for COVID-19 test results (M=4.5 out of 5, 95&#x0025; CI:4.4 to 4.6), and to stay home if they experienced symptoms (M=4.6 out of 5, 95&#x0025; CI: 4.5 to 4.7). Responses did not vary substantially for different demographic groups (Appendix Table S1).</p>
<p>Three quarters of participants (n=546, 77.2&#x0025;) responded that they would &#x2018;get tested no matter what&#x2019; if they developed COVID-19 symptoms in the next four weeks (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This proportion ranged from 58.7&#x0025; for Croatian speakers (n=71), to 99.4&#x0025; for Hindi speakers (n=42). For participants with inadequate health literacy, 72.7&#x0025; indicated that they would &#x2018;get tested no matter what&#x2019; (n=211); compared to 80.3&#x0025; for people with adequate health literacy (n=335).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The most frequently reported information source for participants who said they would get tested for COVID-19 if they had symptoms &#x2018;no matter what,&#x2019; and for participants who listed barriers to testing was official Australian sources or public broadcasters, followed by Australian commercial sources, and social media (Appendix Table S2). Two fifths of participants who listed barriers to testing reporting using overseas information sources (41.4&#x0025; vs no barriers: 25.5&#x0025;) community sources (38.0&#x0025; vs no barriers: 25.3&#x0025;), or family or friends living in Australia (40.5&#x0025; vs no barriers 34.2&#x0025;) as a main way of finding out about COVID-19.</p>
<p>Intention to get tested for COVID-19 symptoms &#x2018;no matter what&#x2019; was significantly associated with age (p=0.03), with participants aged 50-69 years less likely to get tested than participants aged less than 30 years (OR=0.44, 95&#x0025; CI: 0.20 to 0.99, p&#x003C;0.001) (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Intention to get tested also varied significantly across language groups (p&#x003C;0.001). No information sources were significantly associated with testing intention once adjusted for other covariates.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Of the 161 participants who identified at least one barrier to getting tested for COVID-19 in the next four weeks, the most common barrier to testing was concern about infection at the testing clinic (26.1&#x0025;, n=42) (Appendix Tables S3-S4). This was followed by concerns that testing is painful (25.3&#x0025;, n=41), and the belief that if they had already received a negative test, they did not need or want another one (13.9&#x0025;, n=22).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>COVID-19 vaccine willingness</title>
<p>In total, 53.0&#x0025; of participants (n=375) said that they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if it was recommended to them, 29.0&#x0025; (n=205) indicated they were not sure, and 18.0&#x0025; (n=127) responded that they would not get the vaccine (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Vaccine willingness (responding &#x2018;yes&#x2019;) was 58.4&#x0025; (n=200) for male participants, compared to 47.9&#x0025; (n=174) for female participants. This proportion was 56.5&#x0025; for people with adequate health literacy (n=235) compared to 47.8&#x0025; for people with inadequate health literacy (n=139). Across language groups, vaccine acceptance ranged from 29.5&#x0025; (Samoan/Tongan, n=12) to 98.4&#x0025; (Khmer, n=62) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Responding &#x2018;not sure&#x2019; was highest for Samoan/Tongan (57.6&#x0025;, n=24) and Dari speakers (53.2&#x0025;, n=23), whereas responding &#x2018;no&#x2019; was highest for Assyrian (38.7&#x0025;, n=51) and Arabic speakers (25.8&#x0025;, n=21).</p>
<p>For participants who were accepting of the vaccine, the main information sources were official Australian sources or public broadcasters (62.7&#x0025;, n=235), followed by Australian commercial sources (67.1&#x0025;, n=251), and social media (58.2&#x0025;, n=218) (Appendix Table S2). Participants who responded &#x2018;no&#x2019; or &#x2018;not sure&#x2019; reported the same top three information sources.</p>
<p>We observed significant differences in vaccination willingness across language groups (p&#x003C;0.001), controlling for all other covariates (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Female participants were also more likely to be hesitant about COVID-19 vaccination (OR= 1.63, 95&#x0025; CI: 1.10 to 2.43, p=0.02), as were participants who did not use Australian commercial information sources as a main way of finding out about COVID-19 (OR= 0.57, 95&#x0025;CI: 0.37 to 0.86, p=0.01). No other differences were observed across sociodemographic variables.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Of the 335 participants who were not accepting of the vaccine (no/not sure), almost one third (30.7&#x0025;, n=102) indicated concern about vaccine side effects as their main reason (Appendix Table S6). A further 24.2&#x0025; (n=80) listed safety as a concern, and 11.5&#x0025; (n=38) needed more information before deciding. This ranking was similar across language groups (Appendix Table S7).</p>
<p>Three quarters of participants (76.3&#x0025;, n=534) provided free-text responses identifying areas of concern or confusion about COVID-19. We generated 11 topics to categorise responses (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). More than half (53.0&#x0025;, n=286) voiced concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines, with 23.9&#x0025; (n=129) specifically concerned about vaccine safety and side effects. Almost one fifth voiced concerns about how COVID-19 information was communicated (17.4&#x0025;, n=94), discussing the need for translated information (8.4&#x0025;), clearer and more accurate information (8.2&#x0025;), or information available in different formats (3.2&#x0025;).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Key findings</title>
<p>This study provides insight into the perspectives of culturally and linguistically diverse Australians during the start of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, a period characterised by low levels of COVID-19 community transmission (March 21 to July 9, 2021). Three quarters of participants (77&#x0025;) reported that they would get tested for COVID-19 if they experienced symptoms, &#x2018;no matter what,&#x2019; though this proportion varied significantly across language groups. The main barriers to testing were concerns about getting infected at the testing centre and about the test being painful. Just over half the sample (53&#x0025;) were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine if recommended to them, one fifth responded they were unwilling, and the remainder unsure, though again, these proportions varied significantly by language spoken at home. Participants were more likely to say &#x2018;no&#x2019; or &#x2018;not sure&#x2019; to a COVID-19 vaccine if they were female or did not use Australian commercial information sources as a main way of finding out about COVID-19. Key barriers to vaccination were concerns about side effects and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, and a need for more information before making a decision.</p>
<p>We observed higher testing intentions in this study compared to national Australian estimates during a similar time period (77&#x0025; vs 45&#x0025;-51&#x0025;)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021b</xref>), although different survey items were used. This study identified different top barriers to testing as in our previous Australia-wide survey in November 2020; though both observed concerns about the test being painful within the top 5 barriers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bonner et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, we observed lower COVID-19 vaccine willingness in this study compared to national Australian estimates during similar time periods (53&#x0025; vs 68&#x0025;-73&#x0025;)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021b</xref>), though this rate was similar to a study of 199 people from NSW, Australia, who spoke a language other than English at home (58&#x0025;)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">NSW Council of Social Services, 2021</xref>). Key barriers to vaccination were similar in this study and our November Australia-wide survey (i.e. concerns about safety and needing more information)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dodd et al., 2021</xref>), though distrust of the government did not feature highly in the current study; only 3&#x0025; of participants who reported barriers to vaccination said this was because they did not trust the government. This is consistent with findings from a survey of 656 Australian refugees and asylum seekers, in which trust in authorities was not identified as a key COVID-19 concern(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Liddell et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study the main factor associated with testing and vaccination intentions was the language spoken at home, even when controlling for education, socioeconomic status, and English-language proficiency. Given existing inequities for people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities, and the lower vaccination intentions observed in this study, public health should prioritise these groups to support testing and vaccination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dodds and Fakoya, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Al-Oraibi et al., 2021</xref>). This approach must work collaboratively with people in these communities to develop tailored, targeted approaches to COVID-19 vaccine communication and rollout(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wild et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Leask et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chauhan et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Raz et al., 2021</xref>). In fact, the Australian federal government itself laid out policy in November 2020(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Australian Government, 2021a</xref>), emphasising the need for translated and simple English communication about the vaccines and their rollout, providing ample opportunity for people in these communities to ask questions, working with community leaders and representatives, and embedding interpreter workforce into clinical services. However, at the time of study recruitment this policy had not been adequately implemented in Australia. There is evidence that this inclusive approach can also support COVID-19 testing behaviours, as evidenced by community-based strategies implemented in culturally and linguistically diverse neighbourhoods in Seattle in the US(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). This study also supports recent commentary reminding researchers that when collective terms for culturally and linguistically diverse populations are not accompanied by disaggregated outputs, they may inadvertently imply homogeneity where it does not exist(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Routen et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>The main strength of this study is that we addressed deficiencies in previous research by using more inclusive recruitment and data collection methods to increase opportunity for participation. This included providing translated versions of the survey, using interpreters, and multiple recruitment methods (including through social media, community events, and through community networks). We also included several variables related to culture and language (e.g. English language proficiency, literacy in own language, and years living in Australia), and focused on 10 specific language groups, in an attempt to provide a more nuanced description of the sample that captures some of the complexity and diversity within these communities. Whilst this inevitably means that not all cultural and language groups are represented in the survey, we hope that that by focusing on 10 groups with different access to translated materials, English language skills and proficiency in language spoken at home, that the findings have practical value and can inform decision-making to develop tailored supports and resources that serve these communities. This study also did not ask participants if they had already received the vaccine. State-wide estimates suggest fewer than 25 per 100 NSW population had received a single dose of the vaccine at the time recruitment closed(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">covid19data.com.au, 2021</xref>). Lastly, we were unable to incorporate specific items about the Astrazeneca vaccine as recruitment began before the news about its side effects hit mainstream media outlets.</p>

<sec id="s4">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study of people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities in Greater Western Sydney shows that community members have genuine concerns about COVID-19 testing and vaccination, particularly with regards to safety and wanting more information. Different language groups have unique and specific needs that must be met through local targeted communication strategies. Public health bodies must work collaboratively with communities to provide tailored approaches that support people in these communities to take up COVID-19 testing and vaccination, or risk exacerbating health inequalities further.</p>
