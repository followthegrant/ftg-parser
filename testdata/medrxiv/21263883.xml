<title>Abstract</title><p>Following the recent clinical clearance of an Indian DNA COVID-19 vaccine, India and Africa are potential regions where DNA vaccines may become a major delivery system subject to a range of immunological and regulatory scrutiny. The ongoing COVID pandemic highlights the need to tackle viral variants and expand the number of antigens and assess diverse delivery systems. To address some of these key issues, we have created a Dengue DNA vaccine candidate with the EDIII region as the key antigen given the promise of this segment in not causing ADE, a challenge with this disease. In addition, we have added the NS1 region to broaden the immune response. Following a large Dengue viral sequencing exercise in India, complemented with data from east Africa, our approach was to generate a consensus of four serotypes ED3-NS1 vaccine to explore tackling the issue of diversity. Our <italic>In silico</italic> structural analysis of EDIII consensus vaccine sequence revealed that epitopes are structurally conserved and immunogenic across HLA diversity. Vaccination of mice with this construct induced pan-serotype neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cell responses. Furthermore, the DNA vaccination confers protection against DENV challenge in AG129 mice. Finally, assaying of intracellular staining for IFN-&#x03B3;, immunoglobulin IgG2(a/c) /IgG1 ratios as well as immune gene profiling suggested a strong Th1-dominant immune response. Our Dengue DNA platform with a focus on Indo-African sequences offers an approach for assessing cross reactive immunity in animal models and lays the foundation for human vaccine roll out either as a stand-alone or mix and match strategy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vaccine development is an evolving process. The current COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated the development of numerous vaccine technologies to mitigate public health crises. Among other technologies, nucleic acid vaccines have emerged as a rapid and versatile platform for an emergency, which is why these are among the very first COVID-19 vaccines in human use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Nucleic acid vaccines require a short time from design to clinical trials, therefore, it may be possible to test together, in the same vaccine, different variants of antigens that cover circulating mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Nucleic acid vaccines are adaptable for mix and match vaccination approaches. Recently, Barros-Martins et al. and Schmidt et al. reported that heterologous dose with SARS-CoV2 adenovirus-based vaccine (ChAdOx1) followed by SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccine (BNT) induced a stronger immune response than homologous adenovirus vaccine regimen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, they offer more natural antigen presentation to the immune system, resulting in better T-cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. An advantage of DNA over mRNA is they are more versatile, temperature stable, cost-effective, and cold chain free which are essential features for delivery to resource-limited settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. After over 3 decades of research on DNA vaccines, the world&#x2019;s first DNA vaccine against COVID-19 has been approved in India, for emergency use, highlighting the evolution of low-cost vaccine platforms.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard vaccine approaches (i.e. whole genome, peptide, and virus-like particle vaccines) several nucleic acid-based vaccines for DENV are in the pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. DENV vaccine development is complicated by four antigenically diverse serotypes (DENV 1-4) and their intra-serotype (genotype) diversity at both local and global scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Several studies have reported the association between the genotype shift and magnitude of the outbreak and disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. However, data on circulating genotype level information is limited in India. The authors&#x2019; data highlighted the emergence of DENV1 genotype I &#x0026; V, DENV3 genotype III in Southern India and DENV2 cosmopolitan genotype dominated both in the South and in Delhi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Previous studies in India reported co-circulation of DENV 4 genotype I strains in Pune, along with DENV 1, DENV2 and DENV 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Indian DENV sequences are close to African DENV&#x2019;s particularly, Indian DENV2 cosmopolitan genotype found in various outbreaks in Kenya<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The current DENV vaccine effort is also thought to be hampered by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), whereby cross-reactive antibodies against one serotype can enhance subsequent infection by heterologous serotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. To circumvent such issues, regions or motifs of the antigen responsible for causing ADE must be eliminated from the vaccine design. Domain III of E protein has been identified as the major target of highly neutralizing and protective serotype-specific Abs while in contrast, PrM and EDI-II directed antibodies are reported to enhance infection <italic>via</italic> Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> . Recent studies have found that EDIII based DENV vaccines could circumvent ADE of infection in mice, whereas T cell response against EDIII DNA vaccine has shown to play a role in disease protection through effective viral clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Several studies have also shown that EDIII directed antibodies can inhibit the entry of the flavivirus into target cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Mutations in EDIII may affect antibody binding as well as protein interaction with cellular receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Previous studies have reported that mutations in EDIII of DENV and other flaviviruses have lower virulence or the ability to escape immune neutralization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>An effective DENV vaccine should be able to target circulating strain divergence; in this case, a consensus-based vaccine may be optimal. Consensus-based vaccines are an intriguing strategy which could minimize the sequence diversity across strains. Furthermore, recent studies on H1N1 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in mice, have suggested that consensus immunogen-based vaccines may be ideal to address the viral genetic divergence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Moreover, several studies have also shown that consensus-prediction could outperform single-sequence determination methods in vaccine design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has also emerged as an attractive vaccine target. NS1, a highly conserved protein among flaviviruses, is involved in virus replication and immune evasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. However, it has also been reported to activate antibody Fc-mediated effector function and provide protection against flaviviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> . NS1 has been demonstrated to trigger T-cell responses in both experimental animals and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> . Previous studies have shown that NS1 induced T cell responses involved in protection against dengue infection. Furthermore, vaccination with DENV1, DENV3, or DENV4 NS1 protected against a heterologous DENV2 challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Taken together, combining EDIII and NS1 for vaccine design could be a possible way to circumvent immune interference among serotypes. Here, we further developed DENV EDIII based vaccines by integrating the sequence information from circulating genotypes of each serotype instead of a single strain genome sequence; incorporating NS1 to induce broad T cell responses; and then optimizing DNA vaccine construct for optimal protein expression.</p>
<p>This study employs whole-genome sequencing of DENV viruses from direct plasma/serum samples of dengue patients to profile contemporary DENV sequences across India. We examined DENV1-4 EDIII genetic variation in both local and global scales. Consequently, using the sequence data, Indian genotype-specific consensus-based polyvalent vaccine encoding DENV EDIII and NS1 was generated using a DNA vaccine platform. The immunogenicity of this vaccine candidate was evaluated by investigating its ability to induce tetravalent neutralizing antibodies, T cell responses as well as protective immunity in mice.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Samples and Ethical consideration</title>
<p>Serum/Plasma samples of DENV-NS1 positive patients were obtained from four hospitals in India viz. St. John&#x2019;s medical college and hospital (SJRI), Bangalore, All India Institute of Medical Research (AIIMS), Jodhpur, Kasturba hospital for Infectious diseases (KHI), Mumbai, and All India Institute of Medical Research (AIIMS), Delhi during 2012-2018. The Institutional Ethical Clearance Review Boards approved the study of all institutions participating in this study (SJRI-IRB NO:-236/2016, AIIMS, Jodhpur-AIIMS/IEC/2017/49, &#x0026; AIIMS/IEC/2019-20/939, KIH-IRB NO:07/2018, Ethics/THSTI/2011/2.1; AIIMS: IEC/NP:338/2011). Informed consent was obtained from enrolled patients. Clinical information of patients whose samples were included in this study was recorded in a preformed proforma which included the patient&#x2019;s demographic details, signs, and symptoms, of illness, laboratory parameters, and treatment details.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>DENV viral RNA sequencing</title>
<p>Serum/ Plasma was tested for dengue virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies using Panbio Dengue IgM and IgG capture ELISA kits, respectively (Catalog No. 01PE20/01PE21). Dengue infection classified as primary or secondary further samples were classified as per WHO 2009 guideline. According to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions, Viral RNA was extracted from 150 &#x00B5;l of patient serum using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Sequencing library preparation was performed with 1.2 ng of normalized ds cDNA using the Illumina Nextera XT sequencing kit and sequenced on an Illumina Miseq platform, using 2 &#x00D7; 75 and 2 &#x00D7; 150 bp paired-end reads. Raw sequence reads were inspected for quality using FASTQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>), reads were filtered and trimmed based on the quality score.</p>
<p>Reads were then mapped to the reference sequences obtained from the RefSeq database (NC_001477(DENV1), NC_001474 (DENV2), NC_001475 (DENV3), NC_002640 (DENV4) using Geneious assembler (3 iterations and medium-low sensitivity). Assembled reads were checked manually for errors. Serotypes were assigned manually and coverage was assigned based on the following criteria: &#x003E;10X coverage if the depth of the coverage at each base was &#x003E;20 and breadth of the coverage &#x003E;95%, 5X-10X coverage if depth &#x003C;20 and breadth&#x003E;95, 1X if depth&#x003C;10 and breadth&#x003E;90, for less coverages serotype. Consensus sequences were generated from the samples having &#x003E;5X coverage based on the majority rule and were clipped to the length of reference sequences. iqtree v1.6.10 was used to construct maximum likelihood trees with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Genotypes were assigned to our sequences based on their positions in the tree. Figtree v1.4 was used to visualize the tree.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>DENV EDIII genetic diversity</title>
<p>Indian DENV sequences specific to the serotypes, including those sequenced during the study, were retrieved from the ViPR (Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource) database. Sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE and visualized in AliView. EDIII domain sequences were retained and used for downstream diversity analysis. EDIII sequences were compared pairwise against respective DENV reference strains and analyzed for Percentage diversity (Diversity%) and Percentage identity (Identity%). Diversity% was given by: (no. of variable sites/ EDIII length)&#x002A;100 while Identity% was calculated as (100 - Diversity%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Dengue DNA vaccine construction</title>
<p>The polyvalent DENV vaccine DNA construct encodes ED III of all four serotypes and the NS1 sequence of DENV2. The consensus gene sequences were constructed using the predicted consensus sequences from sequences obtained from our study and Indian-specific sequences available in the ViPR.

<p>The DENV DNA vaccine expression cassette was designed with the consensus sequences of the ED III gene of all four serotypes and consensus sequences of the NS1 gene of DENV2 linked together in a single construct with furin cleavage sites between the individual genes. Consensus sequences were optimized for ED III and NS1 expression, including codon and RNA optimization. The Kozak sequences and IgE leader sequence were added upstream to the DNA sequences as were furin cleavage sites to facilitate EDIII and NS1 processing. Finally, the synthetic DENV DNA expression cassette was inserted into the pVAX1 expression vector (Invitrogen, CA) between NheI and HindIII under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (Genscript Biotech, USA).</p>

<title>DENV genome sequencing and genotype analysis</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity of circulating DENV strains in India, designed a DNA vaccine based on circulating DENV genotypes, and evaluated the immunogenicity of this vaccine candidate in two murine models. In essence, we performed a retrospective analysis of 1000 archived serum/plasma samples from NS1 positive patients with dengue clinical presentation collected from 2012&#x2013;2018 from 4 hospitals in India. Whole-genome sequencing of dengue viruses was carried out from the serum of 319 patients. <bold>Supplementary Table.1</bold> summarizes the sequenced patient&#x2019;s sample clinical characteristics. Clinical and biochemical correlates of the sequenced samples of this study are consistent with earlier epidemiological observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Of the 319 samples sequenced, we have obtained 120 whole-genome sequences as well as infected serotype infection of 217 patients. Among the 217 patients, 174 patients were infected with a single DENV serotype (mono-infection), and 43 patients had concurrent DENV co-infections. From the 174 patients, 68 (39.1%) of them typed as DENV1, 63 (36.2%) of them as DENV2, 29 (16.7%) of them as DENV3, and 14 (8%) of them as DENV4. The distribution of serotypes during the sample collection period is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. Our dengue surveillance data collectively suggest that India is endemic to all four serotypes therefore, an effective vaccine must be tetravalent.</p>

</fig>
<p>Furthermore, the phylogenetic-based genotype analysis of our study revealed that all Indian DENV 1-4 strains belong to a single genotype within the serotypes, except DENV1. DENV1, genotype III is the most dominant, apart from a few sequences of genotype I. DENV2 sequences belong to the cosmopolitan genotype, whereas DENV3 and DENV4 sequences belong to genotype III and I, respectively. Our data show that two different DENV2 lineages within the cosmopolitan genotype are propagating simultaneously in all four sites in this study. Both the lineages emerged in the middle of the 1980s. Most of the neighboring sequences are from Asian countries. However, one cluster in the cosmopolitan-b lineage that is found in Kenya and one sequence of a traveler from Ethiopia and Djibouti. Our findings are also consistent with a previous report from Kenya<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. All the Indian sequences of DENV3 genotype III cluster with other Asian countries. The only genotype I of DENV4 is observed in India. All Indian DENV4-I sequences along with one sequence from Pakistan cluster separately within genotype I from other Southeast Asian sequences. This data highlights that even though there is an enormous intra-serotype variation recorded all over the world, India has distinct genotypes for all four DENV serotypes with prominent intermixing between neighboring countries <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-E</xref><bold>).</bold> Studies performed in India during the previous years also have reported the same<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.

<title>EDIII global and local genetic diversity and target for vaccine design</title>
<p>The E protein, primarily DIII domain of the E protein, stimulates host immune responses by inducing protective and neutralizing antibodies. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in the EDIII region could potentially impact the neutralization of DENV and the host-receptor interaction. Hence, we investigated EDIII protein diversity in global strains and how our study sequences are diverging from international reference strains.</p>
<p>To assess antigenic differences between the EDIII of DENV 1-4 strains from distinct parts of the world, we generated a neighbor-joining tree and selected representative genotype variants from each branch to comprehensively represent global diversity within the serotype. We performed a sequence alignment of these proteins and compared their EDIII genetic diversity relative to the respective reference strains. Variable sites were designated when at least one virus showed an amino acid change at any of the 103 amino acid positions in the alignment. While DENV genotypes are closely related, considerable genetic variation was observed across genotypes of the same serotype in the EDIII region with a range of 1.62-5.83% <bold>(Supplementary Table 2),</bold> which is consistent with an earlier report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Further, EDIII amino acid sequences of DENV 1-4 samples from our study were compared for their similarity with the wild-type DENV strains. Even though India has its unique genotypes, considerable genetic variations were found in the EDIII region across genotypes of the same serotype. Alignment of the EDIII amino acid sequences revealed 9, 7, 2, and 8 sites of variation in DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 among Indian genotypes, respectively <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref><bold>).</bold> Among all four strains, DENV1 exhibited the highest EDIII diversity with a median of 4.85% (range, 2.91%-5.83%), followed by DENV4 and DENV2 with 2.91% (range, 2.91%-3.88%) and 1.94% (range, 0.97 %-3.88%), respectively. The percentage diversity of DENV3 EDIII sequences was found to be limited, ranging from 0% to 0.97 %. The frequency of amino acid variants was calculated across strains and expressed as a percentage <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 B, D, F</xref> <bold>&#x0026;</bold> <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">H</xref><bold>).</bold> These mutations were also spotted on the EDIII PDB structure <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 C, E, G</xref> <bold>&#x0026;</bold> <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">I</xref><bold>)</bold>. Additionally, we also identified several highly variable sites across serotypes. A site was considered highly variable when greater than 50% of the study sequences showed a mutation at that position. The number of highly variable sites in domain III were 5, 3, 2, and 1 in DENV1, DENV4, DENV2, and DENV3 strains, respectively. In addition to our study sequences, we also investigated EDIII mutations in all Indian DENV1-4 strain sequences deposited in the ViPR database.

Binding antibody ELISA data revealed that the DDV induced DENV specific antibody responses. The results showed that all mice developed anti-DENV antibodies after a single immunization.

<title>DDV vaccination skewed a Th1-dominant response</title>
<p>Th1 skewness has been shown to elicit a robust adaptive response in terms of cellular activation and antibody production. The induction of polyfunctional Th1 cells is an essential element of a protective vaccine response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>.

Thus, the Th1/Th2 balance elicited by vaccination with DENV DNA vaccine was investigated. The IgG subclass fate of plasma cells is highly governed by Th cells. To determine whether DDV showed skewing of Th1 over Th2 responses, measured Th1-associated IgG subclasses-IgG2a (BAlB/c) <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 B</xref><bold>&#x0026;</bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">C</xref><bold>)</bold> and IgG2c (C57BL/6J) <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 D</xref><bold>&#x0026;</bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">E</xref><bold>)</bold>- against the Th2 associated IgG1. C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice are prototypical Th1 and Th2 animal strains, with C57BL/6J producing high IgG2c and BALB/c, mostly IgG2a. Hence, in C57BL/6J mice, evaluation of IgG2c and IFN-&#x03B3; is critical to correct interpretation of Th1 immune responses. In both strains of mice, DDV vaccination-induced Th1 skewed IgG subclass responses. These findings indicate that the DDV elicits Th1 dominant immune responses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dengue vaccine development is complicated by serotype and its intra-serotype diversity. The high mutation rate associated with the RNA viruses leads to different DENV genotypes and further into lineages and clades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. The genetic and antigenic differences between genotypes of the same serotype were not considered to impact long-term protective immunity and vaccine efficacy. Several recent studies challenge this assumption. DENV homotypic reinfection, reported in people in Nicaragua and Peru, is potentially driven by genotype differences between primary and secondary infecting viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. Some studies have demonstrated that antigenic variation of genotypes can have a high impact on the breadth of antibody neutralization against different genotypes elicited by immune sera from people who have been exposed to natural infections or vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. Petty et al. and Shrestha et.al., demonstrated that monoclonal antibody panels generated against DENV1 genotype II and DENV2 Southeast Asia genotypes have lower neutralizing efficacy against heterotypic genotypes of the same serotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. A similar study on genotype cross-reactivity for DENV3 revealed that DENV3 genotype-I neutralizing antibodies did not confer effective protection against DENV3 genotypes-IV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. Moreover, the limited efficacy of Dengvaxia against DENV2 points towards differences between the vaccine strain and disease-causing DENV in the clinical sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that while selecting vaccine strains, investigators and vaccine developers should consider circulating genotype variants.</p>
<p>Here, we used the whole-genome sequencing approach to investigate the sequence diversity of Indian dengue strains and their distribution patterns. Our sequencing efforts have increased the whole genome sequences from India by 187%. The serotype distribution data of this study revealed a parallel evolution of India-specific genotypes for all four serotypes of Dengue virus by genetic drift with continuous exchange among various regions. Despite globalization and frequent traveling, genotypes are contained within the geographical boundaries with prominent intermixing between neighboring countries. Since the genotypes are bounded geographically, the vaccines should be tested at different locations before approval, or they can be restricted to areas having similar genotypes.</p>
<p>EDIII is a potent immunogen known to elicit serotype-specific antibodies and is less likely to enhance dengue viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Mutations in EDIII of DENV have been reported to influence the neutralization resulting in escape variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. Previous studies have indicated that DENV EDIII region has the highest sequence heterogeneity among genotypes than Domain I or II of the envelope protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Yang et al. and Wahala et. al. also demonstrated that DENV3 genotype-specific EDIII mutations in the type-specific mAbs (8Ab and 1H9) binding sites lead to significant variation or loss of neutralization efficacy across DENV3 genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. Sequencing data of our study revealed that there were multiple mutations in EDIII region, both within and across genotypes of all four serotypes circulating in this region. These mutations could impact the neutralization of viruses and need further investigation. Furthermore, the likelihood of cross-protection across genotypes following vaccination is also debatable.</p>
<p>Here we developed a polyvalent DENV vaccine construct encoding synthetic consensus EDIII of DENV 1-4 and DENV2-NS1 and delivered using DNA plasmid. Despite promising results in preclinical trials, the low immunogenicity of DNA vaccines limits their development for human use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. In this study, DDV was subjected to codon optimization, RNA optimization, and IgE leader sequence utilization which was reported to be favorable to increase the immunogenicity in CHIKV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>, Zika<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>, MERS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>, and SARS-CoV2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>. DNA vaccines. In proof-of-principle studies, we showed that vaccination of mice with DDV delivered <italic>in vivo</italic> by intramuscular EP induced robust anti-DENV reactive IgG responses in both BALB/c and C57BL/6J strains. Importantly, antibody response induced by the DNA vaccine broadly neutralized the infectivity of local and global DENV 1-4 serotypes belonging to the different genotypes. The data indicates that the polyclonal repertoire of antibodies induced by DNA vaccine has adequate breadth of antigenic specificity encompassing multiple strains within each of the four serotypes.</p>
<p>A neutralizing antibody response is an established correlate of protection following vaccination against several flaviviruses including, ZIKA and yellow fever virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>, and likely contributes to protection following immunization with DDV. Our data indicate that passive transfer of serum from DDV immunized mice was sufficient to confer protection against lethal DENV2 challenge in mice. Our data is also comparable with EDIII VLP based tetravalent DENV vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Critically, it was also observed that passive transfer of immune sera reduces clinical severity; it could be due to the NS1 immunity and B cell memory induced by the vaccine candidate. Moreover, the study substantiates DDV-mediated protection from a lethal DENV2 viral challenge despite the low neutralizing antibody titers produced. To our knowledge, there is no epidemiological data on the magnitude of the neutralizing antibody titers necessary for protection against DENV infection. This data supports the quality of EDIII specific antibodies, which could protect against DENV infection.</p>
<p>Although dengue neutralizing antibodies are capable of protecting against dengue infection, there is growing consensus that the optimal tetravalent dengue vaccine should generate neutralizing antibodies as well as T-cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>. Antigen-specific T cell responses live longer than neutralizing antibodies and provide durable protection, making them critical for DENV vaccine development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup>. DDV was found to be capable of inducing antigen-specific T cell responses in mice, as evidenced by the generation of IFN-&#x03B3; in vaccinated animal&#x2019;s splenocytes. It is well known that IFN signaling plays a key role in priming adaptive T cell responses and directly influences the fate of both CD4&#x002B; and CD8&#x002B; T cells during the initial phases of antigen presentation, thus shaping the effector and memory T cell pool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>. The production of IFN-&#x03B3; cytokine has previously been shown to be associated with protection against DENV in experimental animals as well as humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup>. Overall, our data indicate that antigen-specific T cell immunity is indeed robustly activated following immunization of DDV. Furthermore, like whole virus-based vaccines and viral vector vaccines, DDV elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, demonstrating the advantage of DNA vaccines.</p>
<p>Our results indicated that several innate and adaptive immune genes are induced by DDV and can be used to predict the strength of the immune response. In terms of adaptive immunity, DDV was able to elicit DENV specific Th1-predominant responses, as revealed by the IgG(2a/2c)/ IgG1 subtype ratio of antibodies induced by DENV DNA vaccine. Th1 skewness has been shown to elicit robust adaptive responses in terms of cellular activation and antibody production, while Th2 cells are largely responsible for generating the humoral response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Th1 memory cells, especially CD8&#x002B; populations, confer long-term protection through rapid expansion and viral clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup>. One important advantage of using DNA EDIII-NS1 -based vaccine candidate is that DDV-induced predominantly a Th1 biased T cell response, thereby reducing the risk of potential ADE. Additionally, immunological imbalance and exacerbated disease pathology due to Th2 skewness highlight the necessity of Th1 biased immunity in vaccination regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In summary, DENV genome surveillance confirms the serotypes and their genotype diversity in India. We describe the generation of a DENV vaccine based on circulating genotype sequence information, utilizing optimized synthetic DNA plasmid for delivery. Our <italic>In silico</italic> structural analysis of EDIII consensus vaccine sequence revealed that epitopes are structurally conserved and immunogenic across HLA diversity. We have shown that immunization with DENV DNA vaccine resulted in robust neutralizing antibody responses against all four serotypes simultaneously and passive transfer of vaccinated immune sera confer protection against lethal DENV challenge. In addition, our DNA vaccine candidate induces multifunctional antigen-specific T cell responses. Taken together, DDV is a promising vaccine candidate that warrants further investigation. Further, our study emphasizes the utility of consensus sequence approach, in conjunction with DNA delivery, for the development of vaccines against various emerging/re-emerging viruses.</p>

The rmsd indicates values are between 0.17-0.25, Ramachandran map shows that most of the residues are in the allowed region in the predicted structure, the predicted z-score based on ProSA analysis is negative and within the ranges for the solved crystal structures. Together, these analyses indicate that the constructs are predicted to be stable folded as the native EDIII domain in the dengue envelope protein.</p></caption>
