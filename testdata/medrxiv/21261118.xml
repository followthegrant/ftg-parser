<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is closely linked to the brain regions forming the neurocircuitry of addiction. Postmortem human brain tissue enables the direct study of the molecular pathomechanisms of AUD. This study aims to identify these mechanisms by examining differential DNA-methylation between cases with severe AUD (n=53) and controls (n=58) using a brain region-specific approach. Samples of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), Brodmann Area 9 (BA9), caudate nucleus (CN), ventral striatum (VS), and putamen (PUT) were investigated. DNA-methylation levels were determined using the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC Beadchip. Epigenome-wide association analyses were carried out to identify differentially methylated CpG-sites and regions between cases and controls in each brain region. Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA), gene-set and GWAS-enrichment analyses were performed. Two differentially methylated CpG-sites were associated with AUD in the CN, and 18 in VS (<italic>q</italic> &#x003C; .05). No epigenome-wide significant CpG-sites were found in BA9, ACC, or PUT. Differentially methylated regions associated with AUD case-/control status (<italic>q</italic> &#x003C; .05) were found in the CN (n=6), VS (n=18) and ACC (n=1). These findings were mapped to several genes including <italic>IREB2, SLC30A8</italic>, and <italic>DDAH2</italic>. In the VS, the WGCNA-module showing the strongest association with AUD was enriched for immune-related pathways. This study is the first to analyze methylation differences between AUD cases and controls in multiple brain regions and consists of the largest sample to date.</p>
<p>Several novel CpG-sites and regions implicated in AUD were identified, providing a first basis to explore epigenetic correlates of AUD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Every year, approximately 5.3&#x0025; of all deaths worldwide are a result of the harmful use of alcohol and approximately 230 diseases are associated with alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) varies globally, with North African/Middle Eastern countries having the lowest (0.59&#x0025;) and Eastern European countries the highest (4.25&#x0025;) prevalence. With a global prevalence of 1.32&#x0025;, AUD is an important contributor to global disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. AUD is a moderately heritable disease; a meta-analysis of twin studies estimated a heritability of 49&#x0025; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>It has been proposed that drug-induced alterations in gene expression in the neurocircuitry of the brain contribute to addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests that alterations in DNA-methylation, an epigenetic mechanism affecting gene expression, play an important role in addiction (for reviews see: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]). Differential DNA-methylation is associated with alcohol consumption and AUD both in peripheral blood and postmortem brain tissue (for an overview see: Wedemeyer, et al. <sup>7</sup>). Examining alterations in DNA-methylation in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) allows for the investigation of inter-individual differences which are attributable to a phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. For example, a recent EWAS of AUD in peripheral blood suggests that networks in glucocorticoid signaling and inflammation-related genes are associated with AUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Human postmortem brain tissue is a sparse and valuable resource and allows a more direct characterization of AUD mechanisms than possible by analyzing peripheral blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. So far, a small number of postmortem brain studies have been conducted, mostly investigating the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which, due to its role in reward regulation and higher-order executive function, is thought to be disrupted in addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. An EWAS comparing individuals with AUD with age-matched controls detected a range of differentially methylated CpG-sites in Brodmann Area 9 (BA9) in 16 pairs of males, but not in seven pairs of females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Another study identified AUD-associated differentially methylated CpG-sites in Brodmann Area 10, which did not remain significant after multiple testing correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. However, downstream analyses implicated <italic>NR3C1</italic>, a gene coding for the glucocorticoid receptor, which is crucial to stress regulation and found to be functionally relevant in AUD. The increased DNA-methylation in individuals with AUD was also associated with reduced <italic>NR3C1</italic> mRNA and protein expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Investigating DNA-methylation in the wider addiction neurocircuitry may give deeper insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of AUD, and may reveal potential targets for treatment or prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Dysfunction in the addiction neurocircuitry, which comprises areas involved in cognitive control such as the dorsolateral PFC, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and regions in the basal ganglia, can have impairing consequences associated with disrupted reward-related decision-making, alcohol craving, and compulsive alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Of particular interest is the striatum, which is divided into ventral and dorsal subdivisions based on function and connectivity. The ventral striatum (VS), comprises the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and olfactory tubercle while the dorsal striatum contains the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (PUT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. The NAcc is thought to be important in addiction due to its role in processing motivation, more precisely aversion and reward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. The caudate nucleus and putamen both influence motor function; in addition, the caudate is involved in goal-directed action, executive functioning and cognitive control, while the putamen is implicated in various types of learning, including reinforcement learning and habit formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. In a study investigating DNA-methylation in PFC and NAcc, CpG-sites in <italic>DLGAP2</italic> emerged as differentially methylated between 39 male AUD cases and 47 controls in both brain regions; the differences were genotype-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we aimed to identify epigenetic mechanisms associated with AUD, in five brain regions previously implicated in the neurocircuitry of addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Brain-region specific EWAS of AUD were performed in the BA9, ACC, VS, CN and PUT.</p>

<title>Samples</title>
<p>In total, 395 human postmortem brain samples from 111 subjects (53 AUD, 58 controls) were obtained from the New South Wales Tissue Resource Center (University of Sydney, Australia) under study reference number 2009-238N-MA by the Ethics Committee II of the Medical Faculty Mannheim. AUD and control subjects were matched by age and sex. All individuals met the following inclusion criteria, which were determined by next-of-kin interviews: age &#x003E;18, no history of severe psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, or other substance use disorders (except nicotine use disorder), and Western European ancestry. Individuals with AUD were classified according to DSM-IV criteria and had consumed at least 80g alcohol daily, whereas controls had consumed less than 20g. Methylation data was generated in two batches and each batch was analyzed separately. The first batch comprised 220 samples of BA9, ACC, CN, and VS from 28 cases and 27 controls. In the second batch, 175 samples from 56 additional individuals from the CN, VS, and PUT were analyzed. Material from one to five brain regions was available for each individual. Therefore, the sample composition varies between the brain region-specific analyses. A sample description can be found in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the number of samples for each brain region and each batch. Additional phenotype information, such as cause of death can be found in Supplementary Table S1.</p>

<title>Epigenome-wide methylation</title>
<p>DNA was extracted from bulk brain tissue using the DNeasy extraction kit from Qiagen (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The genomic DNA samples were stored at &#x2212;20&#x00B0;C. For the microarray analysis, the samples were randomized based on AUD case/control status and sex, and pipetted on processing plates. Due to the sample and different group sizes, samples from each brain region were processed on separate plates. Epigenome-wide methylation levels were determined using the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC Beadchip and Illumina HiScan array scanning systems (Illumina, San Diego, CA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Data preprocessing, quality control, and filtering</title>
<p>All data preprocessing and analysis steps were performed using the R statistical environment, version 3.6.1. An updated version of the CPACOR-pipeline published by Lehne, et al. <sup>20</sup> was used to extract methylation data from raw intensity data and perform quality control. Samples were removed if (i) DNA quality was not sufficient (missing rate &#x003E; 0.10) or (ii) a discrepancy between methylation-based and phenotypic sex emerged. Probes were removed when (i) the call-rate was insufficient (&#x003C; 0.95), (ii) SNPs with a minor allele frequency &#x003E; 0.10 were located in the probe sequence, (iii) the probes were located on the X or Y chromosome. After quality control 381 samples remained. Depending on the brain region, 657 593 &#x2013; 694 791 sites were available for analysis after filtering. Detailed descriptions of sample size, the number of sites remaining after QC, and the inflation coefficient lambda for each model can be found in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Methylation values were log-transformed (base 2) and included as dependent variables in the association analyses, as recommended by Du, et al. <sup>21</sup>. Control for batch effects and technical quality was applied by extracting signals of the internal control probes of the EPIC array, performing principal component analysis (PCA), and extracting the first ten principal components. These were included as covariates in all association tests. To control for cell-type heterogeneity, cell counts were estimated using the method by Houseman, et al. <sup>22</sup>, with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex reference data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. This approach results in two estimates, one for neurons and one for other cell types. These were standardized so that the sum of both counts added up to one. The estimate for neurons was included as a covariate in all analyses.</p>
<p>Data on smoking was not available for all participants (missing for n=11, 10.81&#x0025;). Smoking status was therefore estimated based on a validated set of sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Estimated smoking was included as a continuous covariate. 86&#x0025; of current smokers were correctly classified; according to the regression model their likelihood of smoking was &#x003E;50&#x0025;.</p>
<sec id="s2d1">
<title>Epigenome-wide association analysis</title>
<p>Tests of methylation differences between individuals with AUD and control subjects were performed with linear models, adjusting for sex, age, postmortem interval (PMI), pH-value, estimated smoking, standardized neuronal cell count, and the first ten principal components of the internal control probes. Each region and each batch was analyzed separately. The summary statistics for CN and VS were then meta-analyzed based on effect estimates and standard errors using METAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]; resulting values are reported as <italic>q-</italic>values. CpG-sites were annotated using the manufacturer&#x2019;s manifest (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://webdata.illumina.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/downloads/productfiles/methylationEPIC/infinium-methylationepic-v-1-0-b4-manifest-file-csv.zip">http://webdata.illumina.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/downloads/productfiles/methylationEPIC/infinium-methylationepic-v-1-0-b4-manifest-file-csv.zip</ext-link>; downloaded on 10th of August 2018). Regression coefficients of differential methylation for the epigenome-wide significant CpG-sites were summarized for each brain region. As each brain region was processed on a separate plate, no inferential statistical procedure was applied to compare DNA-methylation levels between brain regions (due to confounding of batch and regions). Test statistics from all epigenome-wide significant CpG-sites were reported for each brain region and also for an independent EWAS in peripheral blood, in which DNA-methylation levels of male patients with AUD, who had just entered withdrawal treatment were compared with healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>].</p>
<p>As alcohol consumption has strong effects on DNA-methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding all subjects with blood alcohol levels at time of death (n = 8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d2">
<title>Differentially methylated regions (DMRs)</title>
<p>DMRs were identified using the comb-p algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], which accounts for autocorrelation between tests of adjacent methylation sites and combines these sites to regions of enrichment, in a given window. The following settings were used: Seed-p value &#x003C; 0.01, minimum of 2 probes, sliding window 500 bp. The &#x0160;id&#x00E1;k correction as implemented in comb-p was applied to correct for multiple testing. Comb-p was applied to the result statistics for all brain regions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d3">
<title>Gene-Ontology (GO) over-representation analysis</title>
<p>Functional analysis to identify gene pathways targeted by differentially methylated CpG-sites was performed for sites with a threshold of <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>nominal</italic></sub> &#x003C; 0.001 using missMethyl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. missMethyl controls for probe number bias, the increased likelihood of a gene to be differentially methylated, if more probes cover the gene and multi-gene bias, and the fact that probes can be annotated to more than one gene.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d4">
<title>GWAS-Enrichment-Analysis</title>
<p>Gene-sets were created consisting of the genes to which the differentially methylated CpG-sites were annotated. Two gene-sets were created for each of the CN and VS results, one for genes implicated by epigenome-wide significant CpG-sites, and one for genes implicated by nominally significant CpG-sites, giving a total of four gene-sets. Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] was used to test enrichment of those gene-sets in the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d5">
<title>Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA)</title>
<p>The WGCNA R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] was used to generate co-methylated modules and relate those to AUD case-/control status. For each brain region the quantile-normalized beta values of CpG-sites nominally associated (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.05) with AUD status were used as input. Soft power thresholds were picked according to the criterion of approximate scale-free topology (R<sub>signed</sub> <sup>2</sup> &#x003E; 0.90). The number of CpG-sites and the soft power thresholds picked can be found in Supplementary Table S2. Unassigned CpG-sites were clustered in the &#x201C;grey&#x201D; module, which was not taken into account for further analyses.

<title>Epigenome-wide association Analysis</title>
<p>In the CN, two CpG-sites were epigenome-wide significantly hypomethylated in AUD cases compared to controls. The two sites were annotated to the genes <italic>IREB2</italic> (cg04214706) and <italic>HMGCR</italic> (cg26685658). cg04214706 was also differentially methylated in the ACC (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>nominal</italic></sub> = 0.005).</p>
<p>In the VS, 18 CpG-sites were epigenome-wide significantly associated with AUD. Nine CpG-sites were hyper- and nine hypomethylated. The top three hits were annotated to <italic>SLC30A8, FAM20B</italic>, and <italic>PCAT29</italic>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study examined DNA-methylation associated with AUD in regions of the addiction neurocircuitry using an epigenome-wide methylation analysis approach employed in human postmortem brain tissue. The largest of its kind to date and first to examine five brain regions, this study identified several novel differentially methylated CpG-sites as well as DMRs associated with AUD, providing potential insight into underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>We found significant differentially methylated CpG-sites in two striatal regions. In the caudate nucleus, two epigenome-wide significant CpG-sites in <italic>IREB2</italic> and <italic>HMGCR</italic>, were identified. <italic>IREB2</italic> is a gene encoding iron regulatory protein 2, which is an RNA-binding protein that is involved in the regulation of cellular iron metabolism [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=IREB2">https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=IREB2</ext-link>]. Iron overload in the brain has previously been associated with cognitive decline in AUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Neurodegeneration has been reported in two subjects with bi-allelic loss of function variants in <italic>IREB2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. <italic>IREB2</italic> has also been associated with smoking phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. The association with smoking, which strongly affects DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], may be linked to the relevance of the gene to addiction phenotypes. In the present study, the <italic>IREB2-</italic>CpG-site was also differentially methylated in the anterior cingulate cortex (nominal significance), which might reflect a relevance in addiction phenotypes in multiple brain regions.</p>
<p>In the ventral striatum, 18 CpG-sites were epigenome-wide significantly associated with AUD. The strongest association was observed in a CpG-site in <italic>SLC30A8</italic>, which encodes a zinc efflux transporter that is involved in the accumulation of zinc in the intracellular vesicles. Zinc is a structure-building element in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and thereby important for the proper function of ADH, which is needed to break down alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Differential methylation in <italic>SCL30A8</italic> may lead to altered Zinc availability and indirectly impact ADH function, and thus alcohol metabolism. <italic>SLC30A8</italic> has also been implicated in type 1 and type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. In both types epigenetic and transcriptomic levels of SLC30A8 have shown to be altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Heavy alcohol consumption is also an established risk factor for type 2 diabetes on the phenotypic level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Three of the epigenome-wide significant CpG-sites were also differentially methylated in an independent EWAS of AUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. This could point towards a cross-tissue effect of these sites but could also result from blood circulation in the brain.</p>
<p>Significant regional methylation differences were observed in the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, and ventral striatum. One differentially methylated region was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex and that region was annotated to HLA complex group 9, a non-coding RNA in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). HLA antigens play a role in AUD and alcohol-associated liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. In the caudate nucleus, the DMR showing the strongest association with AUD was annotated to <italic>DDAH2</italic>, encoding for dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase, which is involved in the formation of nitric oxide by indirect inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=DDAH2">https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=DDAH2</ext-link>]. Nitric oxide has previously been associated with sleep disturbances, as part of the sleep-wake state controlling metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Sleep disorders and disturbances, such as decreased total sleep time and decreased sleep efficiency, are common in individuals during periods of alcohol consumption and prolonged withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. In rodent studies, alcohol exposure influenced NOS expression in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>] and the knockout of neuronal NOS was associated with increased consumption of highly concentrated alcohol solutions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Of the six DMRs identified in the ventral striatum, a region in <italic>TMEM232</italic> showed the strongest association. <italic>TMEM232</italic> has previously been associated with respiratory traits, such as seasonal allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Another significant CpG-site was annotated to <italic>HM13</italic>. This gene encodes for minor histocompatibility antigen H13. In general, minor histocompatibility antigens function in the immune system by recognizing T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. No studies have investigated direct associations between AUD and H13 expression changes yet, but it is known that the immune system is downregulated in patients with AUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>].</p>
<p>GO-term analyses investigating molecular functions associated with differentially methylated CpG-sites did not yield significant results after multiple testing correction, which is most likely attributable to the limited statistical power. No significant enrichment was observed for each of the gene-sets in GWAS signals for AUD, which could indicate that differential methylation in the newly identified CpG-sites is more sensitive to environmental factors than genetic effects.</p>
<p>In the WGCNA analysis in VS a module enriched for immune-processes was most strongly associated with AUD, which are known to be influenced by alcohol abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>].</p>
<p>In this brain region-specific analysis, comparing individuals with AUD and controls, we focused beside prefrontal areas on striatal regions, as previous studies have indicated that AUD may be associated with a striatal shift in activation from ventral to dorsal, as drug intake changes from goal-directed to habitual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. These studies focus on changes in neurotransmitter release and functional connectivity but it is not known how epigenetic changes impact this functional striatal shift. Our epigenome-wide results provide a first basis to explore epigenetic contributions to functional striatal changes.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. The first is PMI, which can influence the tissue quality. The longer the individual has been deceased before the tissue was extracted from the body, the further along are degradation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. While we corrected for this in our analyses our results may have been affected by postmortem degradation processes nevertheless. Second, we cannot infer whether the observed differences in DNA-methylation are a result of addiction or long-term alcohol consumption, which affects multiple organ systems. However, as the main results remained stable in the sensitivity analyses excluding subjects with current alcohol levels &#x003E;0, we consider it likely that the observed differences are at least independent of acute alcohol exposure. Third, the methylation array used in the present study combined with the bisulfite conversion does not distinguish between methylation and hydroxymethylation. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn regarding methylation type specific effects. Also, for several CpG-sites the effect in the meta-analysis was driven by a large effect in one, but not the other batch and in some of the cases this went hand-in-hand with a change in direction. For example, cg04214706 had a small positive effect, which was statistically not different from zero in the first batch, and a large negative effect in the second. Further samples are needed to validate these findings. Due to the sparse availability of human postmortem brain tissue, our sample size is small compared to EWAS in peripheral blood, which results in limited statistical power, especially taking into account the high multiple testing correction burden. However, EWAS analysis of peripheral blood allows to reveal only limited conclusions about differential methylation in the brain, whereas studies that examine multiple brain sites in a comparative fashion point to region-specific functional changes.</p>
<p>Here, we identified novel associations of differential DNA-methylation between AUD cases and controls, which are prominent in alcohol-related pathways and diseases linked with AUD. To confirm these observations, larger samples are needed from the respective brain regions. Human postmortem brain tissue is difficult to obtain and very few brain banks focus on substance use disorders. Combining existing datasets, generating a larger amount of DNA-methylation data, and integrating multi-omics data, could lead to more conclusive results that may help to understand the molecular changes due to substance abuse in the brain and eventually to the identification of drug targets for more effective treatment of substance use disorders.</p>
