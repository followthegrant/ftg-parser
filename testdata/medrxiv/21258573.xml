<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) occur more frequently in men and are associated with higher mortality in males; however, the molecular basis for these sexual dimorphisms is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that PNETs are associated with the emergence of unique sex-specific transcriptomic differences that are not observed in non-neoplastic pancreatic islet tissues. We also show that while widespread sex-specific differences are present in the DNA methylation landscapes of control pancreatic islets, they are erased in PNETs. This includes a loss of imprinting with regards to many genes. These results implicate an emergence of sex-associated genetic and epigenetic dysregulations in PNETs.</p>

<p>Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are rare neoplasms that develop from pancreatic neuroendocrine cells located in the islets of Langerhans. They represent the second most common primary pancreatic neoplasms and make up approximately 2% of all pancreatic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Epidemiologic studies demonstrate that PNETs exhibit sexual dimorphisms with regards to prognosis, disease recurrence, and complication rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Male predominance in PNET incidence has been observed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Men also exhibit lower overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), higher cancer-specific mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), and significantly lower 5-year survival probability than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). For instance, an analysis of 7,946 cases demonstrated that 55.6% of cases occur in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), an examination of 131 cases showed that 5-year survival probability was 2.8-fold higher in females (p=0.02) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), and a study of 653 cases in elderly patients (75 years old) showed that female patients had a 28% reduction in risk of death due to cancer (HR = 0.72 in females; 95% CI: 0.56&#x2013;0.93) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>While it has been shown that estrogen and progesterone affect PNET development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), genome-wide sex-specific differences in PNETs have not been explored. We therefore sought to investigate the sexual dimorphisms in transcription and DNA methylation landscapes of PNETs to identify novel genomic sex variation that may be associated with the observed clinical differences.</p>
<p>We generated RNA sequencing data from 21 primary PNETs (9 Female (F), 12 Male (M)) (Supplementary Table 1) surgically resected at our institution (Discovery Dataset). To validate our results, we downloaded a publicly available PNET RNAseq data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), consisting of 24 primary PNETs (10 F, 14 M) (Validation Dataset) (Supplementary Table 1). To compare PNET data to controls, we further downloaded RNAseq data from 89 non-neoplastic (control) pancreatic islet tissue samples (35 F, 54 M) (Supplementary Table 2).</p>
<p>In our discovery dataset, we found 559 genes differentially expressed (DE) by sex at genome-wide significance (FDR &#x003C; 0.1), with 60.5% of them overexpressed in males. In the validation dataset, 659 genes were DE by sex, with 60.1% overexpressed in males. In the control dataset, only 173 genes were DE by sex (60.1% overexpressed in males) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a-c</xref>). Interestingly, in both the discovery and validation PNET datasets, there were significantly more genes differentially expressed by sex as compared to control pancreatic islet tissues (discovery vs control: p = 6.5&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>; validation vs control: p = 2.0&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;48</sup>), despite greater sample size (and therefore power) in the control dataset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> and Supplementary Table 3). Additionally, there were significantly more transcription factors (TFs) differentially expressed between sexes in the PNET datasets than in control data (55 and 65 differentially expressed TFs in the discovery and validation datasets respectively; 15 TFs in the control dataset) (discovery vs control: p = 2.7&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>; validation vs control: p = 3.4&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>). Eight TFs were differentially expressed by sex in both discovery and validation datasets, and while 5 of them are located on sex chromosomes and were also differentially expressed by sex in controls, 3 autosomal TFs (HSPA1A, SOX15, and APOA4) were uniquely DE by sex only in PNET samples (see Supplementary Table 3). Notably, SOX15 plays an important role in tumorigenesis in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), potentially including pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In order to investigate whether specific biological programs are differentially regulated by sex, we performed gene set enrichment analysis on the DE genes in our discovery dataset using goseq (see Methods). We found significant enrichment for the Gene Ontology (GO) biological process (BP) &#x2018;detoxification of copper ion&#x2019; (FDR = 0.019). Interestingly, copper transport has been previously implicated in cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). In the validation dataset, there was significant enrichment for the GO BP &#x2018;lipoprotein metabolic process&#x2019; (FDR = 0.0079), which has also been linked to oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>Of all the genes differentially expressed by sex in PNETs, 56 were found to be differentially expressed in both the discovery and validation cohorts. Of these, 37 were differentially expressed by sex in PNETs but not in controls. (All 37 genes are located on autosomal chromosomes.) Sixteen of these genes exhibited concordant fold-changes between the discovery and validation cohorts, meaning that they were differentially expressed by sex in the same direction (i.e., overexpressed in the same sex) in both datasets (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Some of these genes play known roles in tumorigenesis. For instance, <italic>RASSF7</italic> (overexpressed in males with a large effect size: log<sub>2</sub>FC of 30 and 23 in the discovery and validation analyses respectively) is an oncogene that promotes non-small cell lung cancer development and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). <italic>RXRB</italic> is another gene that we found to be overexpressed in males, and it has been shown to promote cancer stemness by serving as a major effector of the oncogene <italic>RAB39A</italic> in the <italic>RAB39A&#x2014;RXRB</italic> axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Not all differentially expressed genes favored worse outcomes in males. <italic>CD52</italic>, overexpressed in female PNETs, is a lymphocyte surface glycoprotein known to inhibit effector T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). It is upregulated in breast cancer and is associated with reduced survival rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The mitogen <italic>IGF2</italic>, whose expression was significantly overexpressed in male-derived PNET tissues, is known to be upregulated in various tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), and has been shown to drive the development of neuroendocrine tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p><italic>IGF2</italic> is a paternally-expressed imprinted gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Because DNA methylation is closely associated with gene expression, we hypothesized that genes differentially expressed by sex may be regulated by DNA methylation. To investigate this hypothesis, we downloaded publicly available DNA methylation (DNAm) data (see Methods) obtained with the Illumina HumanMethylation450 microarray (Illumina 450k) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>
<p>We obtained matched DNAm &#x2013; gene expression data for 23 primary PNET samples (9 F, 14 M) (Supplementary Table 1) and DNAm data for 64 non-neoplastic (control) pancreatic islet tissue samples (18 F, 46 M) (Supplementary Table 2). We analyzed data across 456,928 probes targeting single methylation loci after excluding 17,120 loci with common single nucleotide polymorphisms and probes on the sex chromosomes (see Methods).</p>
<p>We found widespread sex specific DNAm differences in the control pancreatic islet dataset, with 38,623 cytosines (8.4% of all interrogated probes) differentially methylated by sex at genome-wide significance (FDR 0.1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). Of note, since the Illumina 450k array probes target single cytosines (CpGs or to a much lesser extent CHs), differentially methylated cytosines are also commonly referred to as a differentially methylated probes (DMPs). Many of the sex-DMPs (16,800) were associated with regulatory elements (promoters or enhancers) and 35,611 overlapped or were within 5 kb of genes (Supplementary Table 4). None of the sex-DMPs clustered together into differentially methylated regions (see Methods). There were also no long-range regions with consistent significant methylation changes between sexes (DNA methylation &#x2018;blocks&#x2019;) (see Methods).</p>
<p>In contrast to controls, we found sparse DNAm differences by sex in PNET samples, with only 4 cytosines differentially methylated by sex at genome-wide significance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>), 3 of which were also differentially methylated by sex in controls. Of the 4 sex-specific sex-DMPs, 3 overlapped or were within 5 kb of at least one gene (Supplementary Table 5), however, none of these proximal genes exhibited significant correlation between DMP methylation levels and gene expression (Supplementary Figure 2).</p>
<p>As expected, <italic>IGF2</italic> was differentially methylated by sex in the control dataset (4 sex-DMPs overlapped <italic>IGF2</italic>, see Supplementary Table 5). However, <italic>IGF2</italic> was not differentially methylated in the PNET dataset, suggesting a loss of imprinting in the PNET state. In the control dataset, 605 sex-DMPs overlapped or were within 5kb of 87 unique imprinted genes (Supplementary Table 5), whereas no imprinted genes were differentially methylated by sex in PNET samples.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we show that sex-specific differences emerge in PNET transcriptomes. Gene expression in pancreatic islets is known to differ by sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), however, our analysis indicates that the transcriptional differences in PNETs are distinct from those that are observed in non-neoplastic tissue counterparts. Interestingly, these PNET gene expression differences by sex are not related to DNA methylation. In fact, while control islets harbor &#x003E;38,600 sex-specific methylome differences, they appear to be almost completely erased in the cancer state.</p>
<p>Effects of sex on tumorigenesis and clinical outcomes has emerged as an important component in our understanding of oncologic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). However, as yet, there are no sex-specific cancer therapy protocols and no clinical trials investigating outcome differences by sex. It is therefore the logical next step to identify sex-driven differences that would affect prognosis and response to therapy and incorporate that information into clinical trial design. Thus, achieving a greater understanding of molecular differences in PNETs by sex is invaluable for advancing personalized therapy and informing future clinical trial design. Lastly, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors encompass several heterogeneous subgroups, with distinct genomic, clinical, and prognostic profiles. Future studies should analyze sex differences in these PNET subtypes individually, yielding results with a high degree of internal validity, which are applicable to a narrow range of patients with specific cancer subtypes, a concept that underlies the essence of personalized medicine.</p>

For PNET data, only samples generated from primary tumors were used; samples taken from metastatic sites were not utilized. Md5 checksums were verified for all downloaded FASTQ files to ensure download fidelity.</p>

<p>RNA sequencing reads (FASTQ files) were quantified using <italic>Salmon</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), correcting for fragment-level GC biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and using an Ensembl human transcriptome (release 97). A pre-built full decoy transcriptome index for Human Genome version hg38 (downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.refgenomes.databio.org/">www.refgenomes.databio.org/</ext-link>) was utilized when running <italic>Salmon</italic>.</p>
<p>Quantified data was then imported into R and transcript-level quantification was summarized to gene-level with the <italic>tximeta</italic> R package (version 1.8.4).

where M<sub>i</sub> and U<sub>i</sub> are intensities measured by the <italic>i</italic><sup><italic>th</italic></sup> Methylated and Unmethylated probes, respectively, and 100 is an offset constant which is added to regularize the &#x03B2;-value when M and U intensities are low, per Illumina&#x2019;s recommendation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). All of our samples exhibited a bimodal distribution of &#x03B2;-values, with enrichment of low &#x03B2;-values (close to zero) and high &#x03B2;-values (close to 1) (Supplementary Figure 4), consistent with expected results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, the data was normalized via functional normalization, an unsupervised method which removes unwanted technical variation by utilizing control probes on the array. Functional normalization was shown to outperform existing normalization methods when analyzing data that is expected to have global DNAm differences, such as cancer data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). After normalization, we removed 17,120 probes that contained common SNPs (based on dbSNP build 147) at target cytosines or single base extension (SBE) sites. We also dropped the probes on sex chromosomes, as they are harder to accurately normalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). At the end of data processing, we ended up with in a total of 456,928 probes (each one targeting a unique CpG/CH) on 87 samples.</p>

<title>Differential methylation analysis</title>
<p>To find differentially methylated cytosines (referred to as Differentially Methylated Positions/Probes, or DMPs) we fit the following linear model for every cytosine interrogated by the array:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21258573v1_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is the normalized proportion methylation at probe <italic>i</italic> and sample <italic>j, Sex</italic> is a binary variable (Female=0; Male=1), &#x03B1;<sub>i</sub> is the proportion methylation in female samples, and <italic>SVs</italic> are significant surrogate variables representing significant variation due to factors other than the covariate of interest (sex). SVs were estimated by the <italic>SVA</italic> R package (version 3.38.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), and 8 significant SVs were found in both discovery and validation datasets.</p>
<p>After fitting <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref> to each interrogated cytosine, we computed moderated t-statistics and p-values with the <italic>limma</italic> R package (version 3.46.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), and adjusted the p-values for multiple testing via the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (False Discovery Rate, FDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Probes with an FDR &#x2264; 5% were called significantly differentially methylated by sex.</p>
<p>To find differentially methylated regions (DMRs), <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eqn. 1</xref> was utilized, and contiguous probes with absolute DNAm differences between sexes of &#x003E; 0.1 were identified with the <italic>bumphunter</italic> R package (version 1.32.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) (argument: cutoff = 0.1). Statistical significance of the DMRs was assessed by performing linear model bootstrapping with 1000 permutations (by using the <italic>bumphunterEngine</italic> function with the following arguments: nullMethod = &#x2018;bootstrap&#x2019; and B = 1000). DMRs with family-wise error rate (FWER) &#x2264; 0.1 were called significant. To find long-range changes in DNAm (blocks), we utilized <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eqn. 1</xref> and the <italic>blockFinder</italic> function of the <italic>minfi</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). <italic>blockFinder</italic> collapses neighboring CpGs/probes into a single probe-group measurement, and fits <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eqn. 1</xref> for each <italic>i</italic><sup><italic>th</italic></sup> probe group (thus, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> now represents normalized proportion methylation at probe-group <italic>i</italic> and sample <italic>j)</italic>. Similar to DMRs, we required a 0.1 difference in DNAm levels between sexes for DNAm blocks (argument: cutoff=0.1), 1000 linear model bootstrapping permutations were performed (arguments: nullMethod = &#x2018;bootstrap&#x2019; and B = 1000), and blocks with FWER &#x2264; 0.1 were called significant.</p>
<p>DMPs and regions of interest were mapped to genes annotated by GENCODE (version 31). All downloaded 450k datasets were annotated relative to Human Genome version 19 (hg19), so all DNAm analyses were done relative to hg19 for consistency. Whether or not CpGs/probes are associated with promoters or enhancers was determined from Illumina annotation, which is in turn determined using data from the Methylation Consortium (for enhancers) and ENCODE Consortium (for promoters). When determining whether cytosines of interest are proximal to human transcription factors or imprinted genes, a list of human imprinted genes was obtained from geneimprint (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneimprint.com">www.geneimprint.com</ext-link>), and a comprehensive list of human transcription factors was obtained from a review article by Lambert et al (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://humantfs.ccbr.utoronto.ca/allTFs.php">http://humantfs.ccbr.utoronto.ca/allTFs.php</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). All analyses were done on R (version 4.0.3).</p>
