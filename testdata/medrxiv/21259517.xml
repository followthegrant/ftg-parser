<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Objectives</title>
<p>To analyse the association between active and passive cigarette smoking and the incidence of children born with a cleft lip and/or palate within the United Kingdom.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Design</title>
<p>First, a longitudinal time-series study was conducted with routinely collected smoking prevalence data for females over 16 years of age. Second, an interrupted time-series design was used as a natural experiment to assess the impact of smoke-free legislation using segmented Poisson regression.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Setting</title>
<p>United Kingdom.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Population</title>
<p>All children born between 2000 and 2018 and their mothers.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Main outcome measures</title>
<p>Orofacial cleft incidence, reported annually for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and separately for Scotland.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Over the study period, the annual incidence of orofacial cleft per 10,000 live births ranged from 14.2-16.2 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and 13.4-18.8 in Scotland. The proportion of active smokers amongst females in the United Kingdom declined by 37&#x0025; during the study period. Adjusted regression analysis did not show a correlation between the proportion of active smokers and orofacial cleft incidence in either dataset, although we were unable to exclude a modest effect of the magnitude seen in individual-level observational studies. The data in England, Wales and Northern Ireland suggested an 8&#x0025; reduction in orofacial cleft incidence (95&#x0025;CI 1&#x0025; to 14&#x0025;; P&#x003D;0.026) following the implementation of smoke-free legislation. In Scotland, there was weak evidence for an increase in orofacial cleft incidence following smoke-free legislation.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These two ecological studies offer a novel insight into the influence of smoking in orofacial cleft aetiology, adding to the evidence base from individual-level studies. Our results suggest that smoke-free legislation may have reduced orofacial cleft incidence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Non-syndromic orofacial clefts (OFC) of the lip and/or palate are common congenital anomalies with a complex aetiology, based on interactions between environmental and genetic factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Cigarette smoking is a common environmental factor with evidence of a causal role in OFC aetiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Meta-analyses of studies assessing the relationship between active maternal smoking during pregnancy and OFC indicate a moderate effect (OR 1.42, 95&#x0025; CI 1.27 to 1.59).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> A similarly positive association is seen with meta-analyses of studies investigating the relationship between passive maternal smoking (also known as second-hand smoking or environmental smoking) and OFC (OR 1.54, 95&#x0025;CI 1.11 to 2.12).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Conventional observational studies to establish a causal relationship between smoking and OFC have inherent limitations such as selection and recall bias, and confounding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> Randomised controlled trials are neither feasible nor ethical.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Ecological studies, utilising data from national registries, offer an alternative approach, with different sources of bias, and can triangulate evidence by testing hypotheses in a real-world setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Given the associations reported from individual level studies, it is relevant to explore these at the population level.</p>
<p>The UK, with a large population, is well placed for a population-level evaluation of OFC incidence. Cleft services were centralised within the National Health Service in 1998 and the subsequent creation of national cleft registries in 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Smoking habits have changed in the UK population over the last two decades, with a decline in the proportion of people actively smoking in part through the implementation of a series of anti-smoking government policies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> The implementation of comprehensive smoke-free legislation across the UK between 2006-2007 is likely to have reduced exposure to passive smoking,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> with a 27&#x0025; mean reduction in cotinine levels amongst non-smoking adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and an improvement in air quality in public bars.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to use two time-series designs, namely an ecological study and a natural experiment, to determine whether there is any evidence that changing exposure to smoking in the UK has had an impact on OFC incidence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>METHOD</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study design and setting</title>
<p>Two time-series studies were performed in the UK using data from 2000 to 2018. First, an ecological study with longitudinal time-series analysis to investigate the association between the proportion of pregnant women actively smoking and OFC incidence. We used routinely collected national data for both exposure and outcome variables. Second, a natural experiment design with an interrupted time-series analysis was used to assess the impact of the implementation of smoke-free legislation on OFC incidence. We followed published guidance relating to ecological studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and natural experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and reported this observational study using the STROBE framework, where possible to do so.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Outcome variables</title>
<p>The main outcome of interest was annual incidence of OFC, defined as the total number of children born with any subtype of cleft lip and/or palate in the UK per 10,000 live births each year. Incidence data were also obtained for the subtypes cleft lip with or without palate (CLP) and cleft palate only (CPO), to explore whether these subgroups had different associations with smoking, as others have found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The annual calendar year count of live births with OFC in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (EWNI) was accessed from the Cleft Registry and Audit NEtwork (CRANE) from 2000 to 2018.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Case ascertainment in the CRANE database for OFC registration in EWNI is 95&#x0025;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Children registered with CRANE have their cleft subtype identified according to the LAHSHAL classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> Annual counts of all live births with OFC in Scotland was obtained from the clinical database of the National Cleft Service for Scotland, which reported by financial year (April to April) between 2000-2009 and calendar year between 2010-2018. Children born in Scotland between January-April 2010 were counted twice, but exclusion of 2010 data in the analysis did not impact the results. The difference in time interval reporting structures between the two UK cleft data sources precluded data amalgamation, thus outcome data from Scotland was considered separately.</p>
<p>OFC incidence in EWNI was calculated using the number of children born with OFC from the CRANE registry, divided by the total number of live births, reported by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) for England and Wales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and the Northern Ireland Statistics Research Agency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> OFC incidence in Scotland was calculated in the same way using the Scottish clinical database and live birth data reported by financial year in the Scottish Morbidity Record between 2000-2009<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and reported by calendar year by Scottish National Records between 2010-2018.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Ecological study exposure variables and co-variables</title>
<p>The exposure of interest in the ecological study was active maternal cigarette smoking during the first trimester of pregnancy, because this coincides with the embryological formation of facial structures and is thus regarded as the critical time for smoking to play a role in OFC aetiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> We could not identify a nation-wide data source to estimate UK prevalence of maternal smoking in the first trimester;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> therefore, two aggregate proxy measures were used. The primary exposure proxy measure was the proportion of active cigarette smokers in females over 16 years in the UK (Exposure Proxy 1) by calendar year, reported by the ONS Annual Population Survey, which has an annual sample size of 320,000 and aims to be broadly representative of the UK population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> As a sensitivity analysis, the proportion of active smokers amongst all pregnant women attending an antenatal booking appointment in Scotland by financial year was used as a secondary proxy measure (Exposure Proxy 2), reported by Public Health Scotland in the Scottish Morbidity Record.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aggregate time-series data on potential confounders over the 2000-2018 period of the study was sought, including maternal age, maternal alcohol consumption, maternal body mass index and folic acid supplementation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> Maternal age was the most reliably reported co-variable at a population level and was available for populations in both EWNI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and Scotland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> throughout the study period. Other co-variables were either not accurately measured or not available, so were not used in the adjusted model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Natural experiment intervention and bias</title>
<p>The single intervention under investigation in the natural experiment analysis was the implementation of smoke-free legislation in the UK, which prohibited smoking in the workplace and enclosed public spaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> We tested the impact of the 2007 legislation in EWNI (implemented in Wales 2<sup>nd</sup> April 2007, Northern Ireland 30<sup>th</sup> April 2007 and England 1<sup>st</sup> July 2007) and legislation in Scotland implemented 26<sup>th</sup> March 2006 against 19 annual cleft incidence data points between 2000-2018. The risk of bias in the natural experiment was assessed according to the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>We anticipated the impact model of the smoke-free legislation a priori to involve a level change reduction in OFC incidence, due to the well-defined dates of the smoking ban implementation, which should have an immediate impact on passive smoking exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> We did not hypothesise a change in slope of OFC incidence following the legislation, due to the consistent secular trend of decreasing active smoking at the population level present before and after the ban.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> We assumed a lag period, hypothesising that there is an impact of smoking on OFC aetiology in early pregnancy and accounting for the nine-month human gestation period. In EWNI the 2007 smoke-free legislation was introduced between April-July; all children born at term in 2007 would have been conceived prior to the smoking ban; children born in 2008 may have been conceived before or after the implementation of the ban, therefore 2008 data was excluded from the analysis;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> children born in 2009 would all have been conceived after the legislation. For Scotland, the smoke-free legislation was implemented in March 2006, and as cleft cases were counted from April to April, the financial year starting in 2006 was involved in the lag phase and was excluded from the analysis. The first financial year in Scotland where all births would have been conceived after the legislation was 2007.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>All variables were described initially through visualisation and summary statistics of their trends. For all analyses, the count outcome was modelled as a quasi-Poisson distribution to account for overdispersion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and was offset by total live births to model the time-trend of incidence. Autocorrelation was investigated with plots of residuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> The trends in annual OFC incidence were described using cubic flexible spline functions of time with 4 degrees of freedom specified for both EWNI and Scottish datasets to minimise both dispersion and autocorrelation. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>To estimate the potential impact of active smoking prevalence over time on OFC incidence, we used information from our meta-analysis of individual-level studies, in which we reported a pooled odds ratio between active maternal cigarette smoking and OFC of 1.42,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> to create predicted OFC incidence projections at a population level. The projection was created using the proportional attributable fraction (PAF), calculated using both Proxy Measure 1 and 2 of active smoking prevalence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> A worked example of the PAF projections can be found in the supplementary material.</p>
<p>The ecological time-series analytical strategy followed the principles described by Bhaskaran et al. (2013), to investigate whether short-term variation in OFC incidence could be explained by changes in the active smoking exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> To analyse the association between annual OFC incidence and smoking prevalence (for Exposure Proxy 1 and 2 separately) an unadjusted (crude) model was first fitted. The final model was adjusted for the yearly long-term incidence trend and maternal age with a 1-year lag to account for the 9-month human gestation period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>The natural experiment analytical strategy followed the principles described by Lopez-Bernal et al. (2017), with an interrupted time-series segmented regression model used to compare OFC incidence before and after the implementation of the smoke-free legislation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> As justified above, the models were parameterised to allow and test for a change in level of OFC incidence after the legislation. Sensitivity analyses were performed to model a change in level at other non-intervention years (where at least 3 datapoints fall on each side) to assess whether results are just reflecting a better statistical fit to random sampling variation rather than a true finding generated by the introduction of the smoke-free legislation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Raw data are available in the supplementary material. All analyses were conducted using the R Project for Statistical Computing, version 4.0.5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org/">http://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Secular trends</title>
<p>Of 13,225,737 live births in EWNI between 2000-2018, 20,049 children were born with OFC with an annual incidence per 10,000 live births ranging from 14.2-16.2 (IQR 0.9). Of 1,038,843 live births in Scotland, 1,720 children were born with OFC, with an incidence per 10,000 live births ranging from 13.4-18.8 (IQR 2.4). Visual inspection of OFC incidence revealed annual fluctuation and regression analysis with adjustment for long-term trends (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) did not suggest a change over time in either EWNI (&#x03B2;0.002, SE 0.003; P&#x003D;0.616) or Scotland (&#x03B2;0.000, SE 0.006; P&#x003D;0.957).

<p>The proportion of active smokers according to Exposure Proxy 1 (females over 16 years in the UK) decreased annually by a mean of 0.6&#x0025; from 25.5&#x0025; in 2000 to 16.2&#x0025; in 2018 (&#x03B2;-0.61, SE 0.03) and in Exposure Proxy 2 (pregnant females in Scotland) by 0.8&#x0025; from 28.9&#x0025; in 2000 to 15.1&#x0025; in 2018 (&#x03B2;-0.81, SE 0.03;) as seen in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. This was a relative reduction of 36.5&#x0025; for Exposure Proxy 1 and 47.8&#x0025; for Exposure Proxy 2 during the study period. The projected change in OFC incidence in both EWNI and Scotland, calculated from the PAF predictions, was an annual relative reduction of 0.2&#x0025; with Exposure Proxy 1 and 0.3&#x0025; with Exposure Proxy 2.

<p>The pre-legislation trends of OFC incidence were positive and linear in both datasets.

Sensitivity analyses to model the implementation of the smoking ban in 11 additional years in EWNI showed no evidence to suggest a decreasing level change in OFC incidence in any other year but there was a step level increase in 2003 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Our interrupted time-series analysis strategy in EWNI scored a low risk of bias on six of the seven EPOC criteria (see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The risk to external validity from additional time varying factors occurring during the study period, such as alcohol legislation and the global financial crash, formed the major source of bias (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p>

<p>In Scotland the model showed weak evidence for change in level in the opposite direction (RR 1.16, 95&#x0025;CI 0.94 to 1.44; P&#x003D;0.173) following the 2006 smoke-free legislation. Sensitivity analysis showed evidence for step changes in several years before and after legislation implementation (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).

<title>Analysis of orofacial cleft subtypes</title>
<p>The ecological time series analysis did not provide convincing evidence of an association between either CLP or CPO incidence and smoking prevalence in the adjusted analysis for both EWNI and Scotland (see Supplementary Table 9). In the natural experiment in EWNI and Scotland there was weak evidence to suggest step level changes in the incidence of both CLP and CPO and the presence of multiple additional step changes in the sensitivity analysis suggest the results were not robust (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">3</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Statement of principal findings</title>
<p>Smoking behaviour changed dramatically in the UK between 2000 to 2018, with the proportion of active smokers reducing by more than a third. Even with these dramatic reductions in smoking prevalence, the predicted effect on OFC incidence in the study period is relatively small, as illustrated in our PAF predictions. In our ecological time series, there was little evidence of an association between the prevalence of active smoking and the incidence of OFC in either EWNI or Scotland at a population level. The national implementation of smoke-free legislation set the scene for a natural experiment and in EWNI the interrupted time-series model suggested an 8&#x0025; (1 to 14&#x0025;; P&#x003D;0.026) relative step level reduction in OFC incidence following the implementation of the ban. The absence of level change reductions in other years within the sensitivity analyses in EWNI offers some reassurance that the findings reflect an underlying population change in OFC risk factors, rather than a chance statistical finding. However, the results from the natural experiment in Scotland did not replicate those seen in EWNI.</p>

<title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title>
<p>The main strength of this study was the availability of national data for both outcome and exposure that had been collected in a systematic way throughout the study period. The ecological study design is advantageous because it offers the opportunity to examine the contextual effect of an environmental risk factor on a health outcome in complex real-world situations and without the selection bias associated with groups of cases in individual-level studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> The natural experiment is a strong quasi-experimental research design in this setting because there was a clear intervention and the pre- and post-intervention time periods were well differentiated and similar in length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our two proxy measures of the proportion of active smokers amongst pregnant women in the UK had similar trends over time and were therefore likely to be representative of the trends in our target population but were not able to provide information on the multidimensional nature (including intensity and duration) of smoking behaviour. The ecological fallacy has been well described and precludes individual-level inference being applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> For the natural experiment, our two main assumptions were the linearity of the pre-ban trend and the stability of population characteristics and exposures over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> In addition, we assumed that the smoke-free legislation would reduce exposure to passive smoking and whilst this has been demonstrated in public places, there has been a suggestion that smoke-free legislation may lead to an increase in passive smoking in the private or home environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> We attributed observed changes to the intervention, but implementation of additional legislation in the devolved UK nations during the study period (such as increasing the legal age to buy tobacco in England in 2007<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> and the regulation of alcohol sales in Scotland in 2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>) present a threat to external validity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> In addition, the socioeconomic impact of the global financial crash in 2008 may have influenced the distribution of births and ultimately OFC aetiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> although the evidence for any impact on perinatal outcomes following the crash is weak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>Power to detect an effect if one exists in a time-series study is dependent on the number of data points, stability of the data points, strength of effect, autocorrelation and overdispersion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> The number of data points in our study (limited by the availability of OFC data), small anticipated effect size and presence of overdispersion was insufficient to estimate the ecological correlation between smoking and OFC incidence with an informative level of precision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup></p>

<title>Comparison with previous studies</title>
<p>The incidence of OFC has been described in epidemiological studies for many populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> Time-series analysis techniques have been used to evaluate the change in OFC incidence in Slovenia over a 26-year period, with unexplained observation of cycling and clustering of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> Examples of ecological time-series to evaluate the association of environmental exposures and health outcomes have most commonly been performed in the field of air pollution and mortality, where daily data is publicly available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> Two previous ecological studies using data from Denmark and USA did not find an association between reducing prevalence of active smoking and OFC incidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Natural experiment methodology has been used frequently in econometric evaluations, but the translation to health epidemiology is difficult because the interventions being studied are often more subtle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> The Dutch Hunger Winter served as an important example of a natural experiment for birth outcomes, where maternal pre-natal nutrition could be linked to offspring schizophrenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> The impact of smoke-free legislation has shown level change reductions in non-cleft areas of healthcare outcomes, with most evidence for acute coronary events, where there is a pooled level change reduction of 10&#x0025;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> The impact of smoke-free legislation on prenatal outcomes is inconsistent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> but in England has been associated with a 4&#x0025; reduction in low birth weight,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> in Scotland and the Netherlands a 4-5&#x0025; reduction in small for gestational age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> and a pooled reduction of 10&#x0025; in pre-term births across three continents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> We are not aware of a previous study to investigate the impact of smoke-free legislation on OFC incidence.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Interpretation and implications</title>
<p>The findings from this study can be considered in the context of existing knowledge on cleft aetiology and triangulated with results from studies with alternative methodologies. Cigarette smoking is one of many modifiable environmental risk factors that is thought to influence cleft aetiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> The mechanism of action of smoking may take effect either through direct interaction with neonatal tissues or through gene-environment interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> The pooled effect estimate from the meta-analysis of individual-level observational studies was used to project OFC incidence in this study, based on active smoking prevalence and assuming no involvement of confounding factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> The striking finding was that despite a relative reduction in active smoking prevalence of 36-48&#x0025; in the exposure proxies during the study period, the projected relative reduction in OFC incidence was between 2-4&#x0025;. It is important to note that from a public health perspective the complete elimination of active smoking at the start of this study in EWNI, where OFC incidence was 14.8 per 10,000 births, would only have projected a decrease of 1.3 per 10,000 births over the study period and we cannot rule out a change of this magnitude in the data we have.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the absent association between OFC incidence and active smoking prevalence in our ecological study is consistent with data from individual studies in our meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and we lacked power in both EWNI and Scottish data to be able to identify such a small association. We cannot rule out a moderate causal relationship, that may have been masked by annual variation, the influence of confounders or imprecision in the estimates over time. The data are, therefore, compatible with no effect or a moderate effect (as reported in previous observation studies) but not a larger effect.</p>
<p>The level change reduction in OFC incidence observed in the EWNI interrupted time-series corresponded with the implementation of smoke-free legislation and may indicate that a change in exposure to passive smoking was associated with a reduced number of children born with orofacial clefts. Intuitively, active smoking might be expected to have a larger effect on OFC aetiology than passive smoking, but meta-analysis of individual-level data does not show this to be the case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, passive smoking might affect a higher proportion of mothers in the UK and in working environments with exposure to passive smoke for a long duration, the dose could exceed that of females smoking a small number of cigarettes per day. The incline of the slope before and after the legislation and the step level increase observed in the 2003 sensitivity analysis may reflect random variations in OFC incidence or could be linked to increases in other environmental covariables during the study period such as maternal age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> or body mass index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>A level change was not observed in the Scottish data at the time of smoke-free legislation implementation, but step changes in both directions were observed in additional years during the sensitivity analysis. This may reflect the reduced power and increased variability of the smaller Scottish sample size, different smoking behaviours in Scotland or the influence of unique policies from the devolved government on potential confounding factors. Level change reductions have been demonstrated in Scotland following smoke-free legislation for conditions with a higher frequency of occurrence than OFC, such as small for gestational age and hospital admissions for childhood asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>CLP and CPO subtypes share risk factors but have been shown to have distinct epigenetic profiles and have historically been studied in the literature as separate entities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup> There have been conflicting reports from individual-level observational studies about the relative effect estimates of active maternal smoking with these cleft subtypes, but our meta-analysis suggests overlapping confidence intervals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> In EWNI the incidence of CLP and CPO both reduced following the implementation of the smoke-free legislation, but we were underpowered to test for any difference.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Conclusion and future research</title>
<p>These population-level time series studies make use of the systematic collection of both exposure and outcome data in the UK and facilitate a novel insight into the relationship between cigarette smoking and OFC incidence. The data are suggestive of a potentially important public health benefit with a reduction in cleft incidence following the implementation of the 2007 smoke-free legislation in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The findings from this study can be triangulated with previous observational studies to expand and strengthen our knowledge of the modifiable influences on OFC aetiology. Replication of this study within different populations would provide additional confidence for the inferences described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> In addition, alternative approaches, such as utilisation of instrumental variables in a Mendelian Randomisation design, are required to further supplement and overcome the limitation of traditional methods.</p>
