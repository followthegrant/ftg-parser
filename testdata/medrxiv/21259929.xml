<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We have developed a new technique of Feature Importance, a topic of machine learning, to analyze the possible causes of the Covid-19 pandemic based on country data. This new approach works well even when there are many more features than countries and is not affected by high correlation of features. It is inspired by the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure from linear algebra. We study the number of deaths, which is more reliable than the number of cases at the onset of the pandemic, during Apr/May 2020. This is while countries started taking measures, so more light will be shed on the root causes of the pandemic rather than on its handling.</p>
<p>The analysis is done against a comprehensive list of roughly 3,200 features. We find that globalization is the main contributing cause, followed by calcium intake, economic factors, environmental factors, preventative measures, and others. This analysis was done for 20 different dates and shows that some factors, like calcium, phase in or out over time. We also compute row explainability, i.e. for every country, how much each feature explains the death rate. Finally we also study a series of conditions, e.g. comorbidities, immunization, etc. which have been proposed to explain the pandemic and place them in their proper context. While there are many caveats to this analysis, we believe it sheds light on the possible causes of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><sec>
<title>One-Sentence Summary</title>

<title>Main Text</title>
<p>It is easy to see that European and North American countries were disproportionately affected at the onset of Covid-19. This is counter-intuitive, since all these countries have highly functional health systems, a well educated and nourished population, and are states of law. Solid medical services, sanitation, ample living space, good public transportation, well organized cities, etc. are all arguments for having the disease spread more slowly or not at all, yet the opposite happened.</p>
<p>We propose to analyze this contradiction with the help of machine learning, in particular with the use of feature importance (FI) (e.g. Shapley, SHAP values <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)</italic>, permutation importance <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>)</italic>, partial derivatives, sensitivity analysis <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)</italic>, and several other indices that we have developed).<sup><xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref></sup> In the end, due to the peculiarities of the data, we settled on a new method that we have developed for this purpose called orthogonalization. The orthogonalization method is inspired by the Gram-Schmidt <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>)</italic> procedure from linear algebra. It finds the most significant feature for each iteration. By most significant we mean the feature that decreases the <italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>norm by the most. (See below).</p>
<p>We aggregated around 3,500 values as features for each country. This analysis should find de novo which are the features that affect positively or negatively the mortality of the disease. These results are conjectures on the causes and need to be verified explicitly with standard medical/biological procedures. Although the relations found could be correlation, causation, proxies, etc., they still contribute to understanding what matters and what does not matter for the mortality of the disease.</p>
<p>We study the number of deaths per population, which is more reliable than the number of cases (see Caveats, 5). We collected five 4-day groups, starting on April 15th, every 10 days until May 28th. We call each date/problem a dataset. These dates are at the onset of the pandemic and before most countries started taking measures, so more light will be shed on the root causes of the pandemic rather than on its handling. Analyzing different dates is crucial for understanding the stability of the results and for discovering trends.</p>
<p>We also compute what is called row explainability, i.e. for every row (country), how much each feature contributes to the target value. These are represented as coloured maps of the world for each feature.</p>
<p>Finally we also study a series of conditions, e.g. comorbidities, immunization, environmental factors, etc. These conditions have been proposed in the literature or in the media as influencing the pandemic. In our study, we compared them against the selected features, and measured the difference of their performances.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Results: features affecting mortality rates</title>
<p>We ran the orthogonalization algorithm for a maximum of 8 iterations on the 20 datasets. The results of the approximation are quite good - on the average the total <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>is 82.98% (the <italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>norm of the errors was reduced by 82.98% from baseline using ML models trained on most prominent features). The results of orthogonalization can be found here. From the 20 datasets only 69 features are significant. For each feature we aggregated its importance from all of the 20 datasets. The complete list of FI results with explanations can be found here. The features can be thematically grouped as:</p>
<table-wrap id="utbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="21259929v2_utbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>The following figure shows the top 6 feature groups as they evolve during Apr/May. In this case, we added the results for 5 groups of 4 days, equally spaced starting on April 15th ending on May 28th.</p>
<fig id="ufig1" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<graphic xlink:href="21259929v2_ufig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The top group is mainly composed of versions of the index produced by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://kof.ethz.ch/prognosen-indikatoren/indikatoren/kof-globalisierungsindex.html#:~:text=Der%20KOF%20Globalisierungsindex%20misst%20die,nach%20Ende%20des%20Kalten%20Krieges">KOF (ETH Konjunkturforschungsstelle)</ext-link> <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>)</italic> which measures various forms of globalisation. It is not surprising at all that globalisation accelerated the dispersion of the virus at earlier times and caused a significant number of casualties. It is quite remarkable how well one single feature contributes to this explanation. Even within the group the top feature collects 98% of the importance. This top feature is defined by KOF as: &#x201C;Number of international inter-governmental organisations in which a country is a member. International treaties signed between two or more states and ratified by the highest legislative body of each country since 1945. Number of distinct treaty partners of a country with bilateral investment treaties (BITs)&#x201D;.</p>
<p>The next group is novel - it systematically appears second for May/2020 and hence we believe it is quite solid. Calcium starts appearing at the end of April at the fourth iteration and then phases in as second most significant. It is also very uniform, although we have 72 features related to calcium, the top 2 collect 96% of the importance. The data is taken from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.globaldietarydatabase.org/#:~:text=The%20Global%20Dietary%20Database%20(GDD,in%20poor%20and%20vulnerable%20populations)">Global Dietary Database, GDD</ext-link> <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>)</italic>. All the calcium features from GDD are highly correlated with each other. Because of the importance of this result we also analyze it under the conditions section.</p>
<p>Economic quality includes features which cover wealth and good infrastructure. It is not surprising that they appear as significant. This group has 390 features in total, about 20 show up and are difficult to group any further.</p>
<p>Next, there are 271 features related to the environment but one appears clearly at the top. It is Yale&#x2019;s EPI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322641392_2018_Environmental_Performance_Index_EPI">Environmental Performance Index</ext-link>) <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>)</italic>. This group becomes significant in May.</p>
<p>Societal quality is a group of features which appears strong in April and then fades out. It has 272 features of which only 7 appear.</p>
<p>Although the health group and the food group have 712 and 570 features respectively, their weight ranks 8th and 9th. It seems from this data that these groups were not an issue at the onset of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Although at this very early stage the data is not strong, we have an indication of some preventative measures that are important. Given the exponential growth of the pandemic, it is crucial to recognize measures which worked earliest. Here is a table of the ones found.</p>

<title>Country level analysis</title>
<p>The FI analysis can be done at the row level, which we call <italic>row explainability</italic>. Our rows are the countries, and it is very interesting to find how much each feature explains the mortality rate for each country.</p>
<p>More precisely, for each date and each iteration we are selecting the feature which reduces the <italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup> norm the most. The <italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>norm is the sum of the squares of the individual targets, one per country.</p>
<p>We define the FI for each country as the reduction of the square of the target (see orthogonalization below).</p>
<p>We have selected two date-iteration pairs to show here. The same selected feature for about the same date gives very similar results. More detailed explanations and further analyses can be found here.</p>
<p>For the first analysis, we chose the first iteration for May 15th. The selected feature is <italic>globalization</italic>. Each country is colored in scale with the amount that the square of its target changes. The countries in green are those for which <italic>globalization</italic> explains a significant part of the target, i.e. number of deaths per population. The first feature improves most of the largest deviations, but unfortunately in some cases its predictions worsen the targets, which are shown in red.</p>
<fig id="ufig2" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<graphic xlink:href="21259929v2_ufig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We can see that at this stage the predictions using <italic>globalization</italic> for large parts of Europe and the US improve the targets while for Russia, Germany and other countries, <italic>globalization</italic> worsens them slightly. The latter countries had very low death rates at the onset of the pandemic, while they have a similar level of <italic>globalization</italic> as the former.</p>
<p>The next map shows the second iteration for May 15th, where <italic>calcium</italic> is the selected feature. Here we can see that <italic>calcium</italic> helps explain most of the targets for the northern hemisphere while it worsens them a bit for a few others. It should be remembered, that from all the 3200 features, <italic>calcium</italic> is the one which produces the best results (<italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>) for this iteration.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Results for particular conditions</title>
<p>We call a condition any thematically related set of features which have been the subject of scientific study or have been mentioned extensively by the media, e.g. health risk groups. If some of the components of the condition appear in the orthogonalization process, this is confirmation of their potential contribution. If they do not appear in the process, we want to find where they had the best chances of appearing and how far they were from actually appearing.</p>
<p>This analysis has four possible contributions: (a) which is the most important feature in the condition (b) how it compares to the selected one (c) if the feature suddenly loses importance at some iteration, it is an indication that the selected feature in that iteration is the one which shadows the condition and (d) in some cases, the features in the condition are not significant at all, which provides a strong negative result to the conjecture.</p>
<p>This is done by considering each of the features of the condition at each iteration and comparing its contribution against the selected feature for that iteration. This is already done by the orthogonalization process, as all features are tested at each iteration. In most cases the conditions have some significance but lose against the chosen one. This difference is large (except in one case), which means the conditions analyzed are not significant. This analysis will become clearer with the commented examples below.</p>
<p>The conditions we use are (a) health risk groups, (b) blood type <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>)</italic>, (c) calcium intake, (d) immunization (e) inequality (gini index) and (f) preventative measures. The complete information for each condition is in the corresponding link. We show a couple of examples next.</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>(a) Health risk groups</title>
<p>Several papers have mentioned health risk factors, like hypertension <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>)</italic>, diabetes <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>)</italic>, obesity <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>)</italic>, age <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>)</italic>, etc. <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>)</italic> as contributing factors for the fatality rate. In this category we have 276 out of the 3200 features. The following table shows, for each iteration, which of the risk groups is the most significant and quantifies its contribution in terms of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup></p>
<fig id="ufig4" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<graphic xlink:href="21259929v2_ufig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>For this dataset we can see that <italic>kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>)</italic> is the most important feature in the condition group. For the first two iterations it is only 61% and 71% of the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>of the selected feature, which we consider not significant. The third iteration shows a very large drop in the absolute and relative <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>. This means that whatever contribution <italic>kidney disease</italic> was having, it was shadowed by <italic>LPI Governance</italic>, as once it is considered, there is no more contribution from <italic>kidney disease</italic>. The 4th to 7th iterations have features with very low <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, which cannot be considered significant. We also notice a lack of consistency of the features chosen, also a sign of lack of significance.</p>
<p>Consequently, this analysis shows that there is no health risk condition that was significantly affecting the number of deaths at that early stage of the pandemic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b2">
<title>(b) calcium intake</title>
<p><italic>Calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>)</italic> appears as a second selected feature in more than half of the dates. The reason for this analysis is to see where it falls when it is not the selected feature. We select 3 dates to show here. To simplify the results, we do not show iterations where the contribution is <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x003C; 0. 5%. We selected 84 features with calcium information, which can be found here. The results are:</p>
<fig id="ufig5" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<graphic xlink:href="21259929v2_ufig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p><italic>Calcium</italic> is a strong feature in the second iteration, and as time progresses its relative <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> goes from 75% to 90% to 100%. This clearly indicates that <italic>calcium</italic> became important gradually. Although the features in the condition include <italic>milk</italic> and <italic>dairy, calcium</italic> is dominant and when <italic>milk</italic> appears is after calcium has been considered. For the first date, it is interesting to see how the <italic>global adaptation index</italic> shadows <italic>calcium</italic>, and for the second date, <italic>economic quality</italic>. This is an indication that these 3 features may be measuring the same phenomenon. We have noticed that all features of <italic>GDD-calcium</italic> are highly correlated, so it is not surprising to see some variation of the best one. The <italic>calcium</italic> data is taken from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.globaldietarydatabase.org/#:~:text=The%20Global%20Dietary%20Database%20(GDD,in%20poor%20and%20vulnerable%20populations)">Global Dietary Database</ext-link> <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>)</italic>.</p>

<title>Methods and materials</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Data gathering</title>
<p>The target variable that we want to study/predict is the number of deaths per population. Being a pandemic for which cases have been reported in more than 200 countries, we will study this target by country. The country granularity is in itself a controversial decision, too coarse for countries like China, Russia or the US, too small for Andorra, San Marino, Malta, etc. We study only countries with population at least 340,000 to eliminate very sparse entries. With these constraints we have information for about 170 countries. We also select multiple dates for the target variable. We take dates during April/May 2020. The reason to take these early dates is to try to identify the causes for the fatality rates. As time went by, treatments became globalised and political decisions diverged, hence it is more difficult to isolate the ground causes.</p>
<p>The target of the study, the number of deaths per population, is readily available from dozens of places, we chose <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#italian-media">worldometers</ext-link> <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>)</italic> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</ext-link> <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>)</italic>.</p>
<p>For the independent variables, the features, we gathered as much country information as possible. This includes geographic information (size, population, density, climate, coordinates, etc.), demographic information (age distributions, ethnic origins, religions, life expectancy, education, rural vs urban, etc.), medical information (hospitals/doctors per population, prevalence of some diseases, immunization, etc.) economic/development information, education information, and indices (World bank, prosperity, transparency, environmental, inequality, etc.). We have collected more than 3500 features. We include these features when they have data for at least 37.5% of the countries. There are also several other criteria for eliminating features which ends up leaving us with about 3220 features. The sources are very diverse, the UN, WHO, WB, scientific papers, wikipedia and various academic and government agencies are high in the list. The entire list of features with several of their numerical properties can be found here. The values for all features and countries for May 28th can be found here. There are small variations on the number of features and the number of countries for different dates due to missing data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Many datasets</title>
<p>We call a dataset all the data needed to make an ML predictor or an FI analysis. This means all the features for a particular set of countries and a target variable. In statistical terms, a dataset is the matrix of independent variables and the target vector. We produce 20 datasets by selecting targets from different dates. We have five groups of 4 dates each, starting on April 15th and every 10 days until May 28th. The datasets have between 3264 and 3295 features. Having many datasets allows us to gain confidence in the results, knowledge about how stable these are and how they evolve in time.</p>
<p>It is known that countries were reporting their data with some random delays. To mimic this we chose the target value (deaths) from a random date, (Uniform(&#x2212;1,&#x002B;1) from the date for the dataset) for each country.</p>
<p>As is customary in many branches of science, we use negative controls <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)</italic>. Details about the negative controls can be found here.</p>
<p>The diversity forced on targets, plus studying contiguous days, plus the use of negative controls, plus features that appear several times give us confidence in the results. On the other hand, features which appear in the last iterations and in only one dataset are probably less trustworthy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Hyperflat problem</title>
<p>With this data, we have a problem with around 170 rows and 3200 columns. The data matrix is extremely flat, and the problem is totally overdetermined. This places quite a bit of stress on the ML algorithms, most of which have not been designed for this shape of problem, rather the reverse. Hyperflat problems also appear in bioinformatics, e.g. gene expression data is of the same shape (tens of thousands of genes, a few tens/hundreds of patients).</p>
<p>Additionally, we have to contend with many features which are highly correlated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>Machine learning training/testing</title>
<p>The problem, as stated, is a regression problem for which we have 16 methods available to build predictors. The predictors are judged on the accuracy of the prediction, in this case with the <italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup> norm of the resulting errors. For each method we try about 10 to 100 combinations of hyperparameters. The predictors are evaluated with cross-validation <italic>(<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>)</italic> (randomly selected for each trial) and sufficiently many times to be statistically significant. Since the computation is quite formidable, we use ideas of exploration/exploitation to make this more effective. Roughly speaking this means we place most of the effort in the most promising combinations. From this, rather long, procedure we obtain the best method with its best hyperparameters. We have not kept accurate data on the time spent computing except for the last complete run which used 2.1M core-hours. All in all we estimate we used more than 7M core-hours.</p>

<title>Feature importance (FI)</title>
<p>Predictors are the main goal of ML. It is important that they are as accurate as possible. Predictors use features as input, but do not tell us how important each feature is for the prediction. What we want in this context is to find which features they use to make the prediction. This is called feature importance, (FI) i.e. which and how much each feature is contributing to determine the answer. Since we have about 3200 features, the ones most important to determine the number of deaths are extremely interesting. This is not a proof by itself, but a strong indication, after which the medical profession can accept or reject the finding.</p>
<p>A feature which shows no importance is likely to be not relevant. While extremely contrived examples could be very important and still show no FI, this is unlikely to happen. In other words, the positives (high FI) are subject to further study. The negatives can be ignored.</p>
<p>FI should not be confused with correlation. FI finds which features allow us to conclude or explain the target. It may be a positive correlation, or it may be a negative correlation or it could be some other, more complex, dependency. It means that some of the ML algorithms are able to extract information from it to predict the target value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3f">
<title>Orthogonalization</title>
<p>The algorithm that we use for FI is reminiscent of the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process adapted to ML. We have developed this algorithm for this particular problem. In simple terms, it works in consecutive iterations as follows. At the start of each iteration we select the feature which, when used with the previously selected features, produces the best predictor. In this case, <italic>best</italic> means reducing the <italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup> norm of the error by the most. Once the best feature has been selected, a new target is computed; the previous target minus the contribution explained by the selected feature. And the next iteration can start. This gives us a sequence of features usually in decreasing order of importance and with a numerical value (the relative reduction of the <italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>, or <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) indicating its importance. This is a high level description of the procedure, the subject of this algorithm is reported in a forthcoming computer science paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3g">
<title>Instability of orthogonalization</title>
<p>The orthogonalization algorithm, with the Covid-19 data, is not completely stable. If we were to rerun a dataset, typically the first few iterations give the same results, but as the process continues, the inherent randomness of the predictors together with the highly correlated features cause larger and larger variation on the selected features. Often this just means different order of selection, but sometimes different features are selected. This is not inherently wrong. E.g. that calcium intake is selected in one run and milk consumption is selected in another (both highly correlated) may depend on random choices. This instability, choosing targets with minor date variations and running several contiguous dates becomes a tool to detect overfitting. If a feature appears with very low importance and a single time, it is probably not significant. Vice versa a feature that appears with low importance but repeatedly is likely to be significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3h">
<title>Value assigned to importance</title>
<p>The algorithms for FI usually assign a value to the importance. This allows us to rank the features according to their importance. While the numerical value depends on the method, within a method the values are usually continuous. Normally the values are ordered so that higher numerical values mean higher importance. For orthogonalization, the natural measure of importance is the reduction of the <italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>norm of the target vector. Each iteration finds the feature which reduces the <italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>norm by the most, and the relative value of this reduction (usually called the<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) becomes the numerical value of its importance.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="s4">
<title>Caveats</title>
<p>There is a very long list of caveats to this study. Several of them have been pointed out above. The most important ones are:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>We find dependencies, which are not proofs. The most significant findings should be analyzed individually.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Correlation, causation and proxies. A feature that is found to be significant, could be the cause or could be just correlated to the cause. It is useful to define a proxy of the cause. As a real example, at one point in our study, the number of cash dispensing machines appeared to be an important feature. Now these could be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) a proxy for economic wealth or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) a proxy for the amount of cash circulating which helps transmit the virus or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) not a proxy, the machines themselves which are touched by the general public.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The features data is from public sources, external to our group. Most of this data comes from good and reliable sources, like UN, FAO, WHO, WB, CIA, Wikipedia. There is no question that occasionally some of these features contain errors, missing data and other problems. We have deleted some of the data that we found too suspicious, but it is not possible for us to guarantee the quality of all the source data. Some results may be affected by errors in the features.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This analysis is only able to find dependencies when the features selected show enough variation for different countries. A feature which is similar for many countries will not be able to show a dependency. E.g. Suppose that gender was a very important factor for Covid-19 fatalities, most countries have about the same ratio of genders, and hence we will not be able to discern this dependency from this data.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The country level (geographical) granularity of the analysis is quite arbitrary, although it is difficult to find enough information for other granularities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The target variable is also subject to large errors <italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>)</italic>. We had done a similar analysis on the number of cases per population and had to abandon it because the data was clearly less reliable. The fact that most countries produce death certificates and the fact that serious cases of Covid-19 demand hospitalization, makes the mortality rate more reliable. The number of cases, besides reporting problems, is seriously biased by the amount of testing and the asymptomatic cases.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Significant parts of this analysis use novel algorithms. While we have confirmed the behaviour of our new algorithms with specially defined tests, there could be algorithmic/computational problems.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We are making an effort to make all this data/computations reproducible but this has limitations. Computation time and new algorithms are the main issues.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="s5">
<title>Future work</title>
<p>Every person who has seen this analysis has a suggestion on (a) more/new features, (b) different targets, (c) different methods, (d) different dates, etc. These computations are already extremely time consuming. We have to limit this research. Most notably, researchers want to feed the data of the second wave of Covid-19 from the late fall 2020. The analysis of the second wave will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.</p>
