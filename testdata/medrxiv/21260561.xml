<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Multiple SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events suggest that aerosols play an important role in driving the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the detailed roles of coarse (&#x003E;5&#x03BC;m) and fine (&#x2264;5&#x03BC;m) respiratory aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing are not well-understood.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Using a G-II exhaled breath collector, we measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Among the 22 study participants, 13 (59&#x0025;) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic patients and 1 presymptomatic patient. Viral loads ranged from 63&#x2013;5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per patient. Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA, and loads differed significantly between breathing, talking, and singing. The largest proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies was emitted by singing (53&#x0025;), followed by talking (41&#x0025;) and breathing (6&#x0025;). Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85&#x0025; of the viral load detected in our study. Virus cultures were negative.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Fine aerosols produced by talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols and may play a significant role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Exposure to fine aerosols should be mitigated, especially in indoor environments where airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur. Isolating viable SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging, and whether this can be more easily accomplished for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is an important enquiry for future studies.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Key Points</title>
<p>We sampled respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients and discovered that fine aerosols (&#x2264;5&#x03BC;m) generated during talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols (&#x003E;5&#x03BC;m) and may play a significant role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Irrespective of symptomatology, COVID-19 patients can harbor high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in their respiratory tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], and emit SARS-CoV-2 RNA into the air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], which may be culturable under favorable circumstances and collection methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Although virus emissions from talking and singing have not been measured, these expiratory activities are hypothesized to play a crucial role in virus transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. A significant proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is estimated to be from asymptomatic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], and multiple SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] suggest that aerosols may be critical in driving the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, refined public health measures are likely needed to contain the virus, especially in under-vaccinated populations.</p>
<p>Respiratory aerosols range from 0.1&#x2013;100&#x03BC;m in diameter and can be categorized as coarse (&#x003E;5&#x03BC;m) and fine (&#x2264;5&#x03BC;m) aerosols, based on where they deposit in the respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Coarse aerosols are inhalable and deposit in the upper airways, whereas fine aerosols are respirable and deposit in the lower airways. The amount of infectious virus these size fractions carry and their relative importance to SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection is not well-understood. Experimental studies of non-human primates have demonstrated that COVID-19 may be anisotropic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] as more severe illness results from inhaling infectious aerosols that are 1&#x2013;3&#x03BC;m in diameter when compared to direct intranasal and intratracheal inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Other models, however, demonstrate a disease spectrum similar to humans with combined intranasal and intratracheal inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Cynomolgus macaques also shed more SARS-CoV-2 in fine aerosols when compared to coarse aerosols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. To better understand the detailed role of respiratory aerosols in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we measured viral loads in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during breathing, talking, and singing.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Patient Recruitment and Data Collection</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from February&#x2013;April 2021 at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore. All newly admitted patients were screened based on the following inclusion criteria: age &#x2265;21 years and positive for COVID-19 via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Basic demographic data were recorded. Symptom data were collected based on a list of seven pre-specified symptoms. For asymptomatic individuals, the day of diagnosis was recorded as day one of illness. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of clinical respiratory samples and SARS-CoV-2 serology test results were obtained from medical records. Virus genome sequence data were obtained from National Public Health Laboratory records.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Expiratory Sample Collection</title>
<p>Expiratory samples were collected using the G-II exhaled breath collector, described in detail by McDevitt <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Briefly, study participants were seated facing the truncated cone-shaped inlet, with air drawn continuously around the subject&#x2019;s head and into the sampler (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The cone served as a capture type ventilation hood which allowed the collection of expiratory particles with minimal fugitive emissions. Participants were asked to perform three separate expiratory activities on the same day: 30 minutes of tidal breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing. For the talking activity, participants were asked to repeat passages read to them from the children&#x2019;s book, &#x201C;Green Eggs and Ham&#x201D; by Dr. Seuss. For the singing activity, participants were asked to sing &#x201C;Happy Birthday&#x201D;, &#x201C;ABC song&#x201D;, &#x201C;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&#x201D;, and &#x201C;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&#x201D; with background music. Aerosols were collected in two size fractions, namely coarse (&#x003E;5&#x03BC;m) and fine (&#x2264;5&#x03BC;m). The coarse fraction was collected on a Teflon&#x00AE; surface as intake air (130L/min) flowed through a conventional slit impactor. The Teflon&#x00AE; impactor was swabbed thrice, end to end, with a flocked swab first dipped in 1&#x00D7; phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution with 0.1&#x0025; bovine serum albumin (BSA). The swab was rotated during swabbing to ensure that all surfaces of the flocked tip were in contact with the impactor for optimal retrieval of coarse particles. The flocked swab was then placed in a 15mL conical tube containing 1mL of 1&#x00D7; PBS with 0.1&#x0025; BSA. Fine particles were condensed into a reservoir of 1&#x00D7; PBS with 0.1&#x0025; BSA and collected into 50mL conical tubes. In between each activity, the G-II was decontaminated with 10&#x0025; bleach, rinsed with water, and wiped dry.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Sample Processing</title>
<p>Samples were transported to and processed in the National University of Singapore Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory on the same day as collection. Coarse fraction samples were vortexed for 15 seconds, and aliquoted into 1.5mL screw-capped tubes. Fine fraction samples were concentrated with two to four Amicon Ultra-15 100 kDA centrifugal filter units (Millipore, USA), pooled, and filtered through a 0.22&#x03BC;m centrifuge tube filter (Corning). The filtrate was topped up to 1.6mL with Dulbecco&#x2019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2&#x0025; fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1&#x00D7; antibiotic-antimycotic. Fine fraction samples were used for viral culture on the same day, with the remaining volumes aliquoted into 1.5mL screw-capped tubes. Coarse fraction samples were not cultured as the impaction method was not designed for culture analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Samples were kept at - 80&#x00B0;C prior to RNA extraction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Virus Culture</title>
<p>Vero E6 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2&#x0025; FBS in a 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator at 37&#x00B0;C. Cells were seeded in T25 flasks at 1 to 2 days prior to sample inoculation. Flasks were replaced with fresh media (DMEM with 2&#x0025; FBS and 1&#x00D7; antibiotic-antimycotic) and inoculated with 750&#x00B5;l of each processed sample (culture 1). Presence of cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored every 3 to 5 days, and a subsequent passage was performed on day 7 (culture 2). Cultures 1 and 2 were observed for up to 14 days each, and supernatants were harvested at days 7 and 14 for RT-qPCR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Viral RNA Quantification</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from 200&#x03BC;l of each expiratory sample using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. RNA was eluted in 50&#x03BC;l of nuclease-free water (NFW) and stored at -80&#x00B0;C. The CDC N1 assay (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA) was performed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. A 20&#x00B5;l reaction mix was prepared with 5&#x00B5;l of TaqPath&#x2122; 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), 1.5&#x00B5;l of primer-probe mix, 3.5&#x00B5;l of NFW, and 10&#x00B5;l of sample or controls. Thermal cycling was performed with the QuantStudio&#x2122; 6 Pro on fast mode under the following conditions: uracil-N-glycosylase incubation at 25&#x00B0;C for 2 minutes, reverse transcription at 50&#x00B0;C for 15&#x25A1;minutes, an initial denaturation at 95&#x00B0;C for 2&#x25A1;minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95&#x00B0;C for 3 seconds and 55&#x00B0;C for 30 seconds. All samples were analyzed in duplicates. Viral RNA copies were calculated from a standard curve constructed with the N gene positive control plasmid (Integrated DNA Technologies, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Data analyses were completed using STATA version 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). Fisher&#x2019;s exact test was used to compare categorical variables, while Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables between patients with and without detectable virus to identify variables associated with viral shedding in respiratory aerosols. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare median viral loads of different respiratory activities within the subgroup of patients with detectable virus in respiratory aerosols. All statistical tests were two-sided and a p-value of &#x003C;0.05 was considered significant.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty-three patients were enrolled in the study, including 1 patient who withdrew before sample collection. Among the 22 participants, 19 (86&#x0025;) were male, with median age of 38 years (range 23&#x2013; 66). Five (23&#x0025;) were asymptomatic (never developed symptoms). Thirteen (59&#x0025;) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), including 3 asymptomatic patients and 1 presymptomatic patient. SARS-CoV-2 copies emitted per expiratory activity per participant (30-minute breathing, 15-minute talking, or 15-minute singing) ranged from 63&#x2013;5,821 viral N gene copies. Age, sex, virus variant type, clinical symptoms, presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody at diagnosis, and Ct value of clinical sample at diagnosis, were not significantly different between patients with and without detectable viral RNA in respiratory aerosols (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, the median day of illness was significantly different: patients with detectable viral RNA in aerosols were earlier in the course of illness (median day of illness of 3 versus 5, p-value=0.025).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Six participants (27&#x0025;) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from all the expiratory activities. Two (9&#x0025;) emitted detectable levels only from fine speech aerosols. Another two emitted detectable levels only from singing. No patients were observed to have sneezed during sample collection; however, two participants were observed to be coughing. Participant 4, who emitted 417 RNA copies in fine speech aerosols, was coughing during talking and singing. Participant 22 coughed frequently during all three activities but did not emit detectable viral RNA. Altogether, most SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies were emitted by singing (53&#x0025;), followed by talking (41&#x0025;) and breathing (6&#x0025;) (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

Comparing only patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols (n=13), the median number of viral N gene copies generated during singing was 713.6 (IQR 135.1&#x2013;1216.1), compared to 477.9 (IQR 234.5&#x2013;1356.6) for talking, and 63.5 (0&#x2013;227.6) for breathing (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.026). Further comparison revealed that this difference remained significant for fine aerosols, but not for coarse aerosols (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Altogether, fine aerosols (&#x2264;5&#x00B5;m in diameter) constituted 85.4&#x0025; of the total viral RNA load detected in our study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can be aerosolized in the absence of coughing, sneezing, and aerosol-generating medical procedures. More than half of our study participants emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic patients and 1 presymptomatic patient. Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable levels of virus, which is congruent with studies demonstrating higher viral loads in clinical samples in early illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Although the overall viral RNA loads were relatively low, they differed significantly between breathing, talking, and singing, with singing generating the most virus in aerosols, and breathing generating the least. Overall, 85&#x0025; of the total viral load was emitted in fine aerosols (&#x2264;5&#x00B5;m in diameter) when compared to coarse aerosols (&#x003E;5&#x00B5;m in diameter), which is consistent with the observation that smaller particles (0.65&#x2013;4.7&#x00B5;m) account for 77&#x2013;79&#x0025; of total virus particles shed by experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Our results demonstrate the potential for fine respiratory aerosols to play an important role in community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which is in agreement with other expert views suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 transmission events are driven by the airborne route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], and could explain the difficulty in containing the virus. Our results support the calls for proper respiratory protection, airflow patterns, ventilation, filtration, and safe airborne disinfection, particularly in indoor environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], to reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in fine aerosols &#x2013; albeit live virus could not be isolated.</p>
<p>While it has been previously shown that COVID-19 patients can emit infectious virus-laden aerosols into their environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], most environmental SARS-CoV-2 sampling studies have been unable to mechanically retrieve and isolate viable virus from ambient air in the vicinity of COVID-19 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Hence, the infectious proportion of virus emitted from patient expiration remains unclear. In our study, the inability to isolate viable virus from respiratory aerosol samples collected directly from patients (not from their environments) is likely related to the low viral load in our samples compared to those generally found in culturable clinical samples. Our study was limited in that respiratory swabs were not collected on the day of aerosol sampling for comparison of culturability. However, studies have reported that for clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples, viral loads of 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> genome copies/mL are required for isolation of SARS-CoV-2 <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Our sampling methodology yielded viral RNA loads below 10<sup>3.8</sup> genome copies per sample, suggesting that increased sampling duration is needed to reach culturable virus levels. However, critical mutations in certain SARS-CoV-2 variants can augment virus infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], e.g., some patients infected with the Delta variant demonstrate higher viral loads in their respiratory swabs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. These SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially Delta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], can cause a higher secondary attack rate than older strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] and may be more successfully cultured from aerosol samples in future studies, especially if patients are sampled during the short window of enhanced viral shedding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. More studies are warranted to test this hypothesis given that only 4 study participants were infected with non-VOC/VOI variants, and only one with Delta. Thus, aerosol shedding patterns between early and new SARS-CoV-2 strains could not be compared. Additionally, for virus culture in our study, we did not employ Vero E6 cells expressing the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) which can bind and cleave SARS-CoV-2 spike protein more efficiently and facilitate early surface-mediated cell entry and viral fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Although SARS-CoV-2 from saliva and respiratory swabs can be isolated using classical Vero E6 cells, a more sensitive culture assay using Vero E6 TMPRSS2 cells may be superior for culturing virus from patient aerosol samples. Human bronchial epithelial cells may also be more susceptible to infection with wildtype viruses than Vero cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Further efforts to identify optimal culture methods for exhaled breath and environmental samples are warranted.</p>
<p>We observed that patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable levels of virus in aerosols, which is in line with a recent non-human primate model indicating that SARS-CoV-2 aerosol shedding is substantially reduced 4 days post-infection when compared to 2 days post-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], and concurs with the higher viral loads and greater infectivity observed in human clinical samples collected early in illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Additionally, neutralizing antibodies start to appear in COVID-19 patients five days post-symptom onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], which may reduce and neutralize virus that is shed, preventing isolation in cell culture. Although 17 participants (77&#x0025;) were seronegative at diagnosis (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), a serology test nearer the sampling day would have been a better indicator of infectiousness during aerosol sampling. Although 12 (55&#x0025;) were sampled with the G-II machine within 5 days post-symptom onset (plus Participant 9, sampled 2 days pre-symptom onset), we failed to isolate viable virus, suggesting that participants might need to be sampled at an earlier stage of infection, or for longer durations. Recent data suggest that only 2&#x0025; of infected individuals carry 90&#x0025; of the total viral load circulating in a population at any given time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. This implies that only 1 in 50 active cases at any given time would be expected to have high viral loads in exhaled breath. The likelihood of capturing such cases was limited by our small sample size. Thus, researchers must work with contact tracers to proactively isolate and strategically sample large numbers of close contacts of individuals recently infected with SARS-CoV-2 to capture the most accurate data on viral shedding in the community, for which research gaps remain.</p>
<p>Viral RNA loads differed significantly between each of the three activities performed. The most virus copies were emitted by singing, followed by talking and breathing. To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols generated by singing. Our results support existing laboratory simulation data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], and can explain the many airborne SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks involving singing [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The lower number of virus copies detected in speech aerosols may be partially attributed to our study design. While participants sang continuously for 15 minutes, the talking portion of our study was designed to simulate a 15-minute conversation at rest (with pauses) rather than a continuous 15-minute speech/lecture. Higher concentrations of aerosols are also generated by singing compared to talking, with loudness having a large effect on the number of aerosols produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Individuals who generate an above-average amount of aerosols (known as &#x201C;super-emitters&#x201D;) also exist, but it is unclear what causes this phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, a small number of individuals produce more aerosols from breathing when compared to talking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], which may partially explain the asymptomatic participant in our study who emitted more SARS-CoV-2 from breathing rather than talking. The physiological or experimental reasons underlying this observation are unclear.</p>
<p>Our results underscore the importance of reducing exposure to fine respiratory aerosols through non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as universal masking, physical distancing, and increased room ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners in indoor environments can reduce exposure to exhaled respiratory aerosols by up to 90&#x0025; in combination with universal masking, and up to 65&#x0025; without universal masking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], indicating that a multilayered approach of control measures is most effective at decreasing the risk of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Other NPIs include upper-room ultraviolet air disinfection, and the use of fans to control airflow patterns within a space. In singing situations, safe distancing among singers and averting and filtering airflow from choir to audience (e.g., by deploying air curtains), are important considerations. For situations involving talking, determining airflow patterns and minimizing exposure through seating and furniture configurations, distancing, and air movement alteration (such as fans, including desk fans) would be practical options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Fine aerosols (&#x2264;5&#x03BC;m) produced by talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 than coarse aerosols (&#x003E;5&#x03BC;m) and may play a significant role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, exposure to fine aerosols should be mitigated, especially in indoor environments where airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is most likely to occur. While COVID-19 patients shed detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, culturing SARS-CoV-2 from patient aerosol samples remains challenging. Careful focus is needed on sampling methodology and duration, infectiousness of patients during sampling, and virus culture methodology. Whether isolating viable virus in respiratory aerosols can be more easily accomplished from sampling patients infected with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is an important enquiry for future investigations. Minimizing airborne transmission by altering or averting direct airflow exposure in singing and speech situations within indoor environments may be important practical options to adopt.</p>
