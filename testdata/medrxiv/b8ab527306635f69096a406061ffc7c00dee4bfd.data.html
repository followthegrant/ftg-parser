Methods We conducted 30 key informant interviews in four rural counties in Ohio, in May 2020. Three teams of two investigators conducted interviews with local health department staff, community members, meat packing plant management, and community leaders from three communities disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic [Guatemalan (N=12), Marshallese (N=7), Amish (N=11)]. We used the Social Ecological Model to identify and categorize themes.

Results Emerging and overall themes were identified and defined. Investigators identified COVID-19 knowledge gaps, myths, and misinformation, food insecurity, community cohesion, stigma, community culture and norms, lack of workplace safety policies, and access to testing as key themes to COVID-19 prevention.

Conclusions Understanding specific barriers and identifying facilitators that most effectively provide resources, healthcare services, education, and social support tailored to specific communities would help deter SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
