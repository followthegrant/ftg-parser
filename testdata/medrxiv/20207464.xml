<title>Abstract</title>
<p>One increasingly documented tendency of COVID-19 patients is to exhibit neuropsychiatric and neurological symptoms. Here we found that anxiety and cognitive impairment are manifested by 28-56&#x0025; of COVID-19 convalescent individuals with mild respiratory symptoms and are associated with altered cerebral cortical thickness. Using an independent cohort, we found histopathological signs of brain damage in 25&#x0025; of individuals who died of COVID-19. All of the affected brain tissue studied exhibited foci of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, particularly astrocytes. We also found that neural stem cell-derived human astrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection through a mechanism that involves spike-NRP1 interaction. SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes manifested changes in energy metabolism and in key proteins and metabolites used to fuel neurons, as well as in the biogenesis of neurotransmitters. Moreover, infection elicits a secretory phenotype that reduces neuronal viability. Our data support the model in which SARS-CoV-2 reaches the brain, infects astrocytes and consequently leads to neuronal death or dysfunction. These deregulated processes are also likely to contribute to the structural and functional alterations seen in the brains of COVID-19 patients.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the hallmark symptoms of COVID-19 are respiratory in nature and related to pulmonary infection, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 has extrapulmonary effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gupta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Yang et al., 2020b</xref>) including in the central nervous system (CNS)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nalbandian et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, over 30&#x0025; of hospitalized COVID-19 patients manifest neurological and even neuropsychiatric symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kotfis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mao et al., 2020</xref>), and may eventually present some degree of encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Varatharaj et al., 2020</xref>). One study revealed that more than half of hospitalized patients continue to exhibit neurological symptoms as long as approximately three months after the acute stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). Impaired cognition was also confirmed in recovered patients after hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Batty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mcloughlin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pinna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>) and neurological impairment is consistent with substantial damage to the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">De Felice et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) patients reported the presence of the SARS coronavirus in the brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid of subjects who presented neurological symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hung et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with meningitis (Bernard-Valnet et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Moriguchi et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, alterations in the cerebral cortical region, compatible with viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Politi et al., 2020</xref>), loss of white matter and axonal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Reichard et al., 2020</xref>), have all been reported in COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>In line with the potential neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2, recent evidence demonstrated the presence of viral proteins in brain regions of COVID-19 patients and in the brains of K18-ACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Matschke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Song et al., 2020</xref>). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human brain has been associated with significant astrogliosis, microgliosis and immune cell accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Matschke et al., 2020</xref>). Further indicating the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells of the CNS, Song and colleagues showed that SARS-CoV-2 infects human brain organoid cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Song et al., 2020</xref>) Despite the accumulating evidence, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the brain and the consequent repercussions on brain structure and functionality. To gain further insight into the neuropathological and neurological consequences of COVID-19 and possible cellular and molecular mechanisms, we performed a broad translational investigation associating clinical and brain imaging features of COVID-19 patients with neuropathological and biochemical changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS. We found that astrocytes are the main sites of viral infection and replication within the CNS. SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes exhibited marked metabolic changes resulting in a reduction of metabolites used to fuel neurons and build neurotransmitters. Infected astrocytes also secrete an unidentified factor, or combination of factors, that leads to neuronal death. These events might be responsible for the neuropathological alterations and neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients.</p>

<title>Neuropsychiatric symptoms in convalescent COVID-19 patients correlate with altered cerebral cortical thickness</title>
<p>To explore the occurrences of brain damage in COVID-19 patients and dissociate it from the indirect consequences of the severe stage of the disease, we performed cortical surface-based morphometry analysis using high-resolution 3T MRI on 81 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 who had mild respiratory symptoms and did not require hospitalization or oxygen support. The analysis was performed within an average (SD) interval of 57 (26) days after SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR and the subjects were compared to 145 healthy volunteers collected pre-covid period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">S2</xref>). The analysis revealed areas of reduced cortical thickness in the left lingual gyrus; calcarine sulcus, including the cuneus; and olfactory sulcus, including the rectus gyrus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, increased thickness was detected in the central sulcus, including the precentral and postcentral gyrus, and superior occipital gyrus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), which can be associated with vasogenic edemas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Biega et al., 2006</xref>). A subgroup of these individuals (n &#x003D; 61) were subjected to neuropsychological evaluation for anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory, BAI), depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI), logical memory (Wechsler Memory Scale), cognitive functions (TRAIL Making Test) and fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire, CFQ). These tests were performed between 21 and 120 days after diagnosis (median of 59 days). Symptoms of anxiety were identified in approximately 28&#x0025; of the subjects, and 20&#x0025; of individuals presented symptoms of depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1A</xref>). Nearly 28&#x0025; of participants performed abnormally on the logical memory test and regarding cognitive function, approximately 34&#x0025; and 56&#x0025; performed abnormally with TRAIL A and B, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1B</xref>).</p>

<p>When cortical thickness was studied alongside the data from the neurophysiological evaluation, a negative correlation was observed between BAI scores and cortical thickness of orbitofrontal regions (adjusted for CFQ) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table S4</xref>) and a positive correlation was observed between TRAIL B and cortical thickness of the right gyrus rectus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table S5</xref>). We additionally identified significant partial correlations between logical memory (immediate recall test, adjusted for BAI, BDI and CFQ) and cortical thickness of regions associated with language (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Table S6</xref>). These results suggest that a thinner cortex in these areas is associated with poor performance on this verbal memory task. Overall, our findings indicate major alterations in cortical structure are associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 patients with mild or no respiratory symptoms.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in human brain astrocytes of COVID-19 patients</title>
<p>Brain alterations in COVID-19 patients are hypothesized to be a consequence of either inflammatory or hemodynamic changes secondary to peripheral infection or SARS-CoV-2 invading the CNS and compromising cell viability and brain function. Although exacerbated inflammation and cardiovascular dysfunction have been well-characterized in COVID-19 patients who progress to the severe stages of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Li et al., 2020</xref>), the degree of infection of the CNS by SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive. We performed a minimally invasive autopsy via endonasal trans-ethmoidal access to obtain brain samples from 26 individuals who died of COVID-19. Notably, these samples were from brain regions close to the areas in which we identified altered cortical thickness in the patients of the previous cohort. Initially, we performed an unbiased histopathological analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained brain sections to search for features of brain alterations. In our analyses, we observed alterations consistent with necrosis and inflammation in 25&#x0025; of the brain tissues from these individuals (5 out of 26; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7">Table S7</xref>). A deeper analysis revealed a strong predominance of senile changes such as corpora amylacea, lipofuscin deposits and parenchymal retraction around the vessels and the meninges. As brain sampling was performed via transsphenoidal by intranasal puncture, alternating white and gray matter was observed. The intraparenchymal inflammatory process was minimal, but present, represented by lymphocytes and perivascular microglia proliferation. In two cases, more intense inflammation was observed, delimiting tiny inflammatory aggregates, associated with endothelial hyperplasia or gemistocytic astrocytes. Cases with nasal epithelium sampled together with brain puncture demonstrated adaptive epithelial changes with cell balonization of the most superficial cells. Few cases showed small, multifocal areas of liquefaction necrosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2A</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we sought to evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the five brain samples that presented histopathological alterations. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 genetic material and spike protein were detected in all five samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). On average, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was detected in 37&#x0025; of the cells in the brain tissue (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), the majority of these SARS-CoV-2 spike-positive cells (65.93&#x0025;) being astrocytes (GFAP&#x002B; cells; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2B</xref>). As such, approximately 25&#x0025; of all cells in the brain samples of the five COVID-19 patients we analyzed were infected astrocytes. We also detected SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in neurons (NeuN&#x002B; cells; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3A</xref>), but not in microglia (Iba-1&#x002B; cells; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3B</xref>). The specificity of anti-spike antibodies was validated in brain tissue of COVID-19-free cases and in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figures S4A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4C</xref>). Additionally, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was directly correlated with the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>), indicating the presence of replicative viruses in the brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Weber et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm SARS-CoV-2 infects human astrocytes, we analyzed healthy human brain slices that were exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and double-stranded RNA were detected in human brain slices 48 hours post infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 genome was also detected by RT-PCR in brain slices infected at 24 and 48 hours post infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 infection in astrocytes was confirmed by immunostaining the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and GFAP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). We showed that the majority of the spike-positive cells (5.65&#x0025; of total cells) were positive for GFAP (58.33&#x0025; of infected cells; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can preferentially infect astrocytes - and replicate within them - in human brain slices, which is in line with findings from human postmortem brains.</p>

<p>To obtain further evidence of the susceptibility of human astrocytes to SARS-CoV-2 infection, neural stem cell-derived human astrocytes (BR-1 cell line) were exposed to the virus and the viral load was determined at 24h after infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In agreement with what was observed in the <italic>postmortem</italic> brain samples, we confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infects human astrocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>), shown by the detection of viral genetic material (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and spike protein in infected cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). dsRNA was also observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, but not in mock-infected control cells, suggesting viral replication occurs in these cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced human astrocyte viability by 25&#x0025; after 48h post-infection, and remained at that reduced viability after 72h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). To confirm the susceptibility of human astrocytes to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used a replication-competent pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in which the glycoprotein gene (G) of VSV was replaced by the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and which contained a eGFP reporter (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Case et al., 2020</xref>). Our data revealed that the human astrocyte culture was susceptible to VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting that human astrocytes are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). We also evaluated viral replication in NSC-derived neurons and the SH-SY5Y cell line. The profile of astrocytes revealed a productive viral replication at 24h, maintained until 48h, showing effective viral replication (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5A</xref>). The NSC-derived neurons, on the other hand, showed viral replication within 24h followed by a decrease in viral load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure S5B</xref>). Finally, the profile of SH-SY5Y indicated unproductive viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure S5C</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that human astrocytes are permissive cells for SARS-CoV-2 infection and may also represent a site for viral replication in the CNS.</p>

<title>NRP1 is required for infection of astrocytes by SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p>Since astrocytes are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we searched for the cellular receptor involved in the viral entry mechanism. To do so, we started by using a publicly available single-cell RNAseq dataset from brain samples of COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Yang et al., 2020a</xref>) to analyze the expression of classical SARS-CoV-2 receptors such as ACE2, as well as alternative receptors NRP1 and BSG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Daly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). These analyses revealed that ACE2 mRNA was undetected in astrocytes (data not shown)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Matschke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Yang et al., 2020a</xref>). However, astrocytes did express detectable levels of NRP1 and BSG mRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). We also found that the expression of NRP1 and BSG mRNA was increased in astrocytes from COVID-19 patients compared to controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Furthermore, the percentage of astrocytes expressing these receptors was also higher in the patients (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Since the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike to BSG remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Shilts and Wright, 2020</xref>), we decided to explore the possible role of NRP1. Firstly, we performed Western blotting using cultured neural stem cell-derived astrocyte extracts to evaluate whether the single-cell RNAseq data was also seen in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model and confirmed at the protein level. We confirmed that human astrocytes do not express ACE2, whereas they do express NRP1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">S6</xref>). We used A549 cells transduced with ACE2 as the positive control. NRP1 receptor expression was seen to be markedly higher than the near-zero ACE2 expression in all cells (i.e., astrocytes, neural stem cell (NSC)-derived neurons and SH-SY5Y cells), and SARS-CoV-2 infection did not affect NRP1 or ACE2 expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). To determine the role of NRP1 in the mechanisms behind SARS-CoV-2 infection in astrocytes, we pre-incubated these cells with a neutralizing, anti-NRP1 antibody. Neutralizing NRP1 in this manner inhibited the infection of astrocytes by SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Further supporting the participation of NRP1 in the infection of human astrocytes by SARS-CoV-2, we found that antibody-based neutralization of NRP1 also inhibited VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 infection of cultured astrocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infects human astrocytes by interacting with the NRP1 receptor.</p>

<title>Proteomic and metabolomic changes in SARS-CoV-2-infected human astrocytes</title>
<p>To identify downstream mechanisms that are triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection and, as such, possibly involved in the changes observed in the brain tissues of COVID-19 patients, we analyzed the proteome of SARS-CoV-2-infected human astrocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based shotgun proteomics revealed 170 differentially expressed proteins in SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes compared to mock-control cells, being 68 upregulated and 102 downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7A</xref>). A subset of the differentially expressed proteins showed sufficient differences to compose a molecular signature that was able to clearly distinguish the infected astrocytes from mock-controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, pathway enrichment and interactome analyses revealed that these proteins are involved in a wide range of biological processes and predicted regulatory networks affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Pathways involved in carbon/glucose metabolism were among the most enriched (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). NSC-derived neurons and SH-SY5Y cell lines were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and shown a different proteome profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">Figure S8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8B</xref>). Pathways enrichment analysis revealed higher similarity between NSC-derived neurons and SH-SY5Y cell lines when compared to NSC-derived astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8">S8C</xref>).</p>

<p>We also evaluated whether SARS-CoV-2 can trigger the same response as other neurotropic viruses, such as the Zika virus (ZIKV). In this case, we infected NSC-derived astrocytes with SARS-CoV-2 and ZIKV with a MOI of 1.0. While overall protein identification provided high overlap, the statistically different proteins for each condition showed low similarity, indicating that the molecular changes induced by ZIKV and SARS-CoV-2 are distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Figures S9A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">S9D</xref>). When the KEGG Pathway Database was used for analyses, the enriched pathways in SARS-CoV-2 and ZIKV showed little overlap; however when the Reactome Pathway Database was used, a higher overlap was observed between the enriched pathways. Altogether, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and ZIKV elicit specific cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Figure S9E</xref>).</p>
<p>We also conducted LC/MS proteomics with a separate set of samples consisting of 12 <italic>postmortem</italic> brain samples from COVID-19 patients <italic>vs.</italic> 8 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. We identified 656 differentially expressed proteins, 117 downregulated and 539 upregulated. Pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases, carbon metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation were enriched in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7B</xref>). Notably, astrocytic proteins were the most present among the differentially expressed proteins, consistent with the higher frequency of infected astrocytes observed in COVID-19 <italic>postmortem</italic> brains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Proteins found differentially expressed in SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes and in <italic>postmortem</italic> brain tissue samples were commonly associated with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, carbon metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infects astrocytes in the CNS, affecting energy metabolism and modulating proteins associated with neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>Since there are significant proteomic alterations in metabolic pathways, we sought to investigate whether the infection of human astrocytes would impact the levels of key metabolites involved in energy metabolism. LC/MS-based metabolomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes showed marked changes in metabolic intermediates of glycolysis and anaplerotic reactions, indicating a remodeling of astrocyte metabolism (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). This phenomenon was marked by the decrease in pyruvate and lactate, which are downstream metabolites of the glycolytic pathway, as well as a reduction in glutamine and intermediates of glutamine metabolism such as glutamate, GABA and alpha-ketoglutarate (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Despite these variations, there were no significant changes in tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS10">Figure S10</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 infected-astrocyte bioenergetics were further characterized by Seahorse Extracellular Flux analysis, showing increased respiration in infected cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). This was due to an increase in both mitochondrial (maximal respiration) and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption in SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes; the former was linked to higher proton leakage indicating increased uncoupled respiration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate increased metabolic activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes and a reduction of metabolites used by these cells to support neuronal metabolism and function.</p>

<title>Conditioned medium from SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes reduces neuronal viability</title>
<p>Astrocytes are essential in the control of brain homeostasis, not only because they are the main energy reservoirs of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rouach et al., 2008</xref>) but also due to their important role in protective responses to cell damage triggered by infection or sterile inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Liddelow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Yun et al., 2018</xref>).

This is despite the fact that NSC-derived neurons and SH-SY5Y neurons did not present a reduction in cell viability after 24h when directly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8D</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>) nor was there a reduction in viability after 48h or 72h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">Figures S11C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">S11D</xref>). Nonetheless, neuronal exposure to the medium conditioned by SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes reduced the neuronal viability after 24h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">Figure S11E</xref>). It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 genetic material was not detected in SH-SY5Y neurons and NSC-derived neurons incubated with SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocyte-conditioned medium (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS11">S11F</xref>), ruling out the possibility that neuronal death was due to infectious particles present in the conditioned medium. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes release soluble factors which reduce neuronal viability.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Our study evidences structural and functional alterations in the brain tissue of COVID-19 patients which correlate with neuropsychiatric and neurological dysfunctions. This study and other reports showing alterations in brain structure and the manifestation of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Troyer et al., 2020</xref>) raise a debate on whether these clinical features are a consequence of peripheral changes or the potential ability of the virus to invade the CNS. Our findings support the latter, at least in part, as we detect SARS-CoV-2 in brain tissue collected from patients who died of COVID-19. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect brain cells has been demonstrated using <italic>in vitro</italic> models such as stem cell-derived neural cells and cerebral organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Song et al., 2020</xref>). Viral particles have also been found in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Matschke et al., 2020</xref>), localized to the microvasculature and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Song et al., 2020</xref>), as well as in the choroid plexus (Jacob et al.) and meninges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Yavarpour-Bali and Ghasemi-Kasman, 2020</xref>). However, the magnitude of this infection and its distribution within brain tissue had not been demonstrated. Here we show that astrocytes are the main locus of infection - and possibly replication - of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients&#x2019; brains, as evidenced by the detection of the viral genome, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and dsRNA in both <italic>postmortem</italic> brain tissues and <italic>in vitro</italic> astrocytes. These findings are in line with recently published evidence showing that astrocytes from primary human cortical tissue and stem cell-derived cortical organoids are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andrews et al., 2021</xref>). Evidence was, however, insufficient to conclude if SARS-CoV-2 completes its replication cycle in astrocytes, warranting further experiments.</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Meinhardt et al. 2021</xref> described that SARS-CoV-2 could access the CNS through the neural&#x2013;mucosal interface in olfactory mucosa, entering the primary respiratory and cardiovascular control centers in the medulla oblongata. Other proposed routes of SARS-CoV-2 neuro-invasion are through the infection of brain endothelial cells or the inflammatory response produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, both causing dysfunctions in blood-brain barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alquisiras-Burgos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Meinhardt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Reynolds and Mahajan, 2021</xref>). At this point, there is much left to be learned about the routes of SARS-CoV-2 neuro-invasion and how the virus can navigate across those different brain cell types, producing manifestation of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>While ACE2 is the most well-characterized cellular receptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells through the interaction with the viral spike protein, other receptors have also been identified as mediators of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hoffmann et al., 2020</xref>). According to our data and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Matschke et al., 2020</xref>), astrocytes do not express ACE2, whereas we found higher expression of NRP1. This receptor is abundantly expressed in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Daly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), particularly in astrocytes and neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>), and blocking its availability using neutralizing antibodies reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in these cells. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infects <italic>in vitro</italic> astrocytes via the NRP1 receptor, though this is yet to be proven <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>To understand the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NSC-derived astrocytes, we searched for changes in the proteome in a non-hypothesis-driven fashion. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in substantial proteomic changes in several biological processes, including those associated with energy metabolism, in line with previous reports in other cell types infected with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bojkova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Grenga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stukalov et al., 2020</xref>). Noteworthily, differentially expressed proteins in COVID-19 <italic>postmortem</italic> brains were enriched for astrocytic proteins, strengthening our own findings that these are the most affected cells by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human brain. Differentially expressed proteins in COVID-19 <italic>postmortem</italic> brains were also enriched for oligodendrocyte, neuron and Schwann cell markers, although less significantly when compared to astrocytes. Our proteomic data also evidenced changes in components of carbon metabolism pathways in both <italic>in vitro</italic> infected astrocytes and <italic>postmortem</italic> brain tissue from COVID-19 patients. These pathways were particularly associated with glucose metabolism.</p>
<p>Since astrocyte metabolism is key to support neuronal function, changes in astrocyte metabolism could indirectly impact neurons. One way astrocytes support neurons metabolically is by exporting lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Turner and Adamson, 2011</xref>) and one of the most critical alterations seen here caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in astrocytes was a decrease in pyruvate and lactate levels. Moreover, intermediates of glutamine metabolism such as glutamate and GABA were decreased in SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes. This said, there were no significant changes in any core intermediates of the TCA cycle. Together with the increased oxygen consumption rate of SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes, these results suggest that glycolysis and glutaminolysis are being used to fuel carbons into the TCA cycle to sustain the increased oxidative metabolism of infected astrocytes. Astrocyte-derived lactate and glutamine are required for neuronal metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gandhi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>) and synthesis of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Walls et al., 2011</xref>). Astrocytes play a vital role in neurotransmitter recycling, a crucial process for the maintenance of synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. This is especially important at glutamatergic synapses since proper glutamate uptake by astroglia prevents the occurrence of excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">B&#x00E9;langer et al., 2011</xref>). Upon this uptake, glutamine synthetase converts glutamate to glutamine, which can then be transferred back to neurons, thus closing the glutamate-glutamine cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Mergenthaler et al., 2013</xref>). This is also true for GABAergic synapses, where the neurotransmitter GABA is taken up by astrocytes and metabolized first to glutamate and then to glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bak et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, astrocytes are responsible for maintaining glutamate levels in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">B&#x00E9;langer and Magistretti, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Magistretti, 2009</xref>). Hence, given the importance of the coupling between astrocytes and neurons, alterations in astrocytic glucose and glutamine metabolism are expected to compromise neuronal function, affecting neuronal metabolism and synaptic function and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bonansco et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the metabolic changes observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes that may impact neuronal dysfunction, we also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits a secretory phenotype in astrocytes that results in increased neuronal death. Our data points to the release of one or more still unidentified neurotoxic factors by SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes. A similar phenomenon has been observed when astrocytes are activated by inflammatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Guttenplan et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Liddelow et al., 2017</xref>). Neuronal death may explain, at least partially, the alterations in cortical thickness we found in COVID-19 patients. A recent study with 60 recovered patients and 39 healthy controls also identified gray matter abnormalities 97 days after the onset of the disease, with increased volume in some areas of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). While that study analyzed hospitalized patients, we evaluated individuals that did not have to be hospitalized (i.e., had mild respiratory symptoms), and nevertheless, we observed notable alterations in cortical thickness. Importantly, some of these alterations correlated with severity of symptoms of anxiety and impaired cognition, which is consistent with previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Knutson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Milad and Rauch, 2007</xref>). Since one of the hypotheses for the neuroinvasive mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is via the olfactory nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mao and Jin, 2020</xref>), we speculate that the associations between BAI and TRAIL B scores and structural alterations in the orbitofrontal region may be a result of the action of the virus in this cortical area, closely related to the olfactory nerves.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that these regions are anatomically close to the brain regions from which we obtained <italic>postmortem</italic> samples (through endonasal trans-ethmoidal access) and identified histopathological alterations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings are consistent with a model in which SARS-CoV-2 is able to reach the CNS of COVID-19 patients, infects astrocytes and secondarily impairs neuronal function and viability. These changes might contribute to the alterations of brain structure as observed here and elsewhere, thereby resulting in the neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms manifested by some COVID-19 patients. Our study comes as a cautionary note that interventions directed to treat COVID-19 should also envision ways to prevent SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the CNS and/or replication in astrocytes.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Eighty-one patients (60 women, median 37 years of age) previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled prospectively for this study after signing an informed consent form approved by the local ethics committee. These individuals presented mild symptoms during the acute phase and did not require hospitalization or oxygen therapy. They had a median interval of 54 days (range 16-120 days) between their RT-PCR exam and the day of MRI scanning and interview. For cortical thickness analysis, we included one hundred and forty-five controls (103 women, median 38 years of age) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Whelan et al., 2018</xref>) from our neuroimaging databank, given the difficulties and risk of recruiting healthy volunteers during the pandemic. The outpatients and healthy controls were balanced for age (p&#x003D;0.45) and sex (p&#x003D;0.65). The neuropsychological evaluations and neuroimaging analyses were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Campinas (CAAE: 31556920.0.0000.5404) and all subjects signed a consent form to participate.</p>

<title>Neuropsychological evaluation</title>
<p>We performed neuropsychological evaluations of sixty-one of these patients. They were tested for symptoms of anxiety using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and symptoms of depression using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Garcia et al., 2019</xref>). Symptoms of anxiety were confirmed for those with a BAI higher than 10 points, and depression symptoms defined for those with a minimum of 14 points on the BDI. Anxiety symptoms were considered mild (BAI 11-19), moderate (20-30) or severe (31-63) and depression symptoms were considered mild (BDI 14-19), moderate (20-35) or severe (36-63). We evaluated verbal memory (immediate and delayed episodic memory) using the Logical Memory subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bolognani et al., 2015</xref>), in which the examiner verbally presents two stories, each including 25 pertinent pieces of information. Subjects are required to recall details of each story immediately after its presentation and again after 20 minutes. To evaluate other cognitive functions, we applied the TRAIL Making Test (TMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Llin&#x00E0;s-Regl&#x00E0; et al., 2017</xref>), which is subdivided into two steps. <italic>Step A</italic> assesses processing speed and visual search in a task that requires connecting 25 randomly arranged numbers in ascending order. <italic>Step B</italic> evaluates alternating attention and cognitive flexibility in a task associated with shifting rules in an ascending sequence of 25 numbers. A training stage is applied to both steps. We calculated z-scores for the results of these tests based on Brazilian normative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bolognani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Campanholo et al., 2014</xref>). For each test, the function was categorized as preserved (z-score &#x003E; - 0.99, including average, high average, above average and exceptionally high scores); low average score (z-score between &#x2212;1 and &#x2212;1.5); below-average score (z-score between &#x2212;1.51 and - 2); and exceptionally low score (z-score &#x003C; &#x2212;2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beauchamp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Guilmette et al., 2020</xref>). The Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ-11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jackson, 2015</xref>) was used to evaluate fatigue in these subjects in which they were instructed to answer 11 questions (measured on a Likert scale 0-3), which yields a global score out of 33.</p>

The T1 images were first spatially registered and segmented into gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid before calculating cortical thickness using the projection method described by Dahnke et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Righart et al., 2017</xref>). For voxelwise analysis of extracted maps, we used CAT12/SPM12 tools for an independent t-test (comparing COVID-19 patients and healthy controls), including age and sex as covariates. The results displayed were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Genovese et al., 2002</xref>) correction (p&#x003C;0.05). For anatomical identification, we used the Destrieux Atlas (2009) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Destrieux et al., 2010</xref>). Cortical parcellation was performed with standard CAT12 tools to extract the cortical thickness of regions of interest for correlations with neuropsychological scores. We used SPSS 22 for statistical analysis of clinical and neuropsychological variables. The FDR procedure was applied to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons (when necessary) with R software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Team, 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Generation of human astrocytes (hES-derived)</title>
<p>Differentiation of glial progenitor cells was performed from neural stem cells (NSC) derived from pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hES, BR-1 cell line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fraga et al., 2011</xref>), according to the method published by Trindade, 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Trindade et al., 2020</xref>). NSCs were cultured in plates coated with Geltrex Matrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) using 1:1 Neurobasal&#x2122;/Advanced DMEM/F12 medium and 2&#x0025; neural induction supplement. Upon reaching 50&#x0025; confluence, the medium was changed to DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco&#x2019;s Modified Eagle Medium/F12), 1&#x0025; N2 supplement, 1&#x0025; fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1&#x0025; penicillin-streptomycin and maintained at 37&#x00B0;C in humidified air with 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> for 21 days. At this stage, cells were considered glial progenitor cells (GPCs). Subsequently, GPCs were plated at low density (30-40&#x0025; confluence) on Geltrex-coated plates and treated with DMEM/F12 medium, 1&#x0025; GlutaMAX Supplement, 10&#x0025; FBS and 1&#x0025; penicillin-streptomycin. The differentiation medium was replaced every 2-3 days. After 4 weeks of differentiation, the cells were considered mature astrocytes. The cells were plated on Geltrex-coated coverslips at a density of 4&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> cells for immunostaining assays (24-well plates) and 2.5&#x00D7;10<sup>5</sup> cells for viral load, proteomic and metabolomic analysis (6-well plates). All products used for cell culture are from Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA. The characterization of the BR-1 lineage as astrocyte cells has been previously described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fraga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ledur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Trindade et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). We generated eight batches of human astrocytes from BR-1-derived NSCs. The NSCs were of different passages and were used as biological replicates in independent experiments. Our internal control showed that about 97&#x0025; of the neural stem cell-derived astrocytes in culture expressed GFAP, 80.4&#x0025; expressed vimentin and 12.9&#x0025; expressed SOX-2 (markers of progenitor cells). The neural stem cell-derived astrocyte culture expressed more astrocyte markers than progenitor cell markers, showing an excellent effectiveness of human astrocyte generation (hES-derived; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS12">Figure S12</xref>).</p>

The dataset was downloaded and the RDS file was imported into R environment version v3.6.3. Astrocyte cells were filtered based on cell type annotations provided by the original authors. To calculate the percentage of cells expressing BSG and NRP1, cell frequency was calculated considering cells with gene count &#x2265; 1 in the RNA essay for each gene (BSG and NRP1). Cells that met this criterion of minimum expression were considered as expressing the respective gene. A differential expression analysis was conducted using the FindMarkers function in Seurat with the Wilcoxon test comparing COVID-19 astrocyte cells vs non-viral astrocyte cells. Specifically, genes were calculated considering a minimum percent expression of genes in cells of 5&#x0025; and average log fold change above 0.1. Genes were considered differentially expressed if the adjusted p-value was below 0.05.</p>

<title>Proteomics sample preparation, LC-MS/MS analyses and data processing</title>
<p>Astrocytes infected with SARS-CoV-2 and a mock control were collected in biological triplicate. Cells were chemically lysed with lysis buffer (100mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 1&#x0025; Triton-X and protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and mechanically lysed with an ultrasonication probe during 3 cycles of 20s each with 90&#x0025; frequency on ice. The total protein extract was quantified by BCA, according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). 30&#x00B5;g of total protein extract from each sample was transferred to a Microcon-10 centrifugal filter with a 10kDa cutoff for FASP protein digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Distler et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, proteins were reduced (10mM DTT) at 56&#x00B0;C for 40min, alkylated by 20 minutes in dark at a room temperature (50mM IAA) and digested overnight by trypsin at 37&#x00B0;C in 50mM ammonium bicarbonate (AmBic), pH 8.0. One the following day the peptides were recovered from the filter in 50mM AmBic, and trypsin activity was quenched by adding formic acid (FA) to a final concentration of 1&#x0025; (v/v), whereupon the peptides were desiccated in a SpeedVac and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until use.</p>
<p>Digested peptides were resuspended in 0.1&#x0025; FA. LC-MS/MS analyses were performed in an ACQUITY UPLC M-Class System (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) coupled online to a Synapt G2-Si mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). 1&#x03BC;g of peptides were loaded onto a trapping column (Symmetry C18 5&#x03BC;m, 180&#x03BC;m &#x00D7; 20mm, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) and subsequently separated in the analytical column (HSS T3 C18 1.8&#x03BC;m, 75&#x03BC;m &#x00D7; 150mm; Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). For gradient elutions, 0.1&#x0025; FA was used as eluent A and acetonitrile-FA (99.9&#x0025; ACN:0.1&#x0025; FA) as eluent B. A reversed phase gradient was carried out during a 120-minute method, with a linear gradient 3 - 60&#x0025; acetonitrile over 90min at 300nL/min. In the Synapt G2-Si, the peptide spectra were acquired by ion mobility-enhanced data-independent acquisition (HDMS<sup>E</sup>). Mass spectrometry analysis was performed in &#x201C;Resolution Mode&#x201D;, switching between low (4eV) and high (25&#x2013;60eV) collision energies, using a scan time of 1.0s per function over 50&#x2013;2000m/z. The wave velocity for ion mobility separation was 1,000m/s and the transfer wave velocity was 175m/s. A [Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide B standard (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) was used as the reference lock-mass compound. Each sample was run in three technical replicates.</p>
<p>The raw data from each experiment were processed in Progenesis QI for Proteomics (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> proteome database (UNIPROT, reviewed, release 2020-04), using tolerance parameters of 20ppm for precursor ions and 10ppm for product ions. For peptide identification, carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionines as a variable modification, 2 missed cleavages were permitted and a false discovery rate (FDR) was limited to 1&#x0025;. Protein identification was performed using a minimum of 1 fragment ion matched per peptide, a minimum of 3 fragment ions per protein and a minimum of 1 peptide per protein.</p>
<p>The label-free quantitative analysis was carried out using the relative abundance intensity normalized by all peptides identified. The expression analysis was performed considering the technical replicates for each experimental condition, following the hypothesis that each group is independent. Proteins with ANOVA (p) &#x2264; 0.05 between groups were considered differentially expressed.</p>

<p>The samples were resuspended in 100&#x03BC;L of a methanol:water mixture (1:1) and for each analysis, 4&#x03BC;L of the sample was injected. Sample separation was performed by hydrophobic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) using an Acquity UPLC&#x00AE; BEH amide column (1.7&#x00B5;m, 2.1mm x 100mm). The mobile phases used for the separations were ACN:H<sub>2</sub>O (80:20) as mobile phase A and ACN:H<sub>2</sub>O (30:70) as mobile phase B, both phases containing 10mM ammonium formate and 0.1&#x0025; ammonium hydroxide.
