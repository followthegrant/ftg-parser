<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) caused by <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites, infects mammals transmitted by <italic>Phlebotomine</italic> sand-flies and mostly affects the poorest. VL distributed worldwide and prevalent in Ethiopia. Knowing occurrence of disease and risk factor is a remedy for controlling. The aim of study was to identify factors associated with VL.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Case control study was carried out during October-November 2019 in Borena. A 1:2 Cases and controls were identified by case definition and 33 cases were included in the study. Participants &#x003E;18years interviewed and caregivers of &#x003C;18 were questioned for legal issue. Epi-info and SPSS were used for data entry and analysis. Primarily predictors were identified using chi-square at significant level P&#x003C;0.05 with 95&#x0025;CI, then candidate predictors were analysed using bivariate and multivariate analysis to identify associated factors.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Result</title>
<p>Among 153 suspected cases, 9 suspected deaths reported; 33 (22&#x0025;) cases and 3 deaths were verified for VL. Among 33 verified cases 15(45.5&#x0025;) were in July 2019, in comparison of 4years data, there is surge cases in July-August 2019, 26(79&#x0025;) of cases were from Dire, Attack Rate (AR) = 15/100,000, CFR=9.1&#x0025;. Among all, 15-64year were highly affected with AR=19.3. A case control engaged 99(100&#x0025;) respondents and among all 93(93.9&#x0025;) were male, 68(68.8&#x0025;) were 15-64years. Adult education Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 30.438(2.378, 389.602), bed-net AOR=9.024 (1.763, 46.205) and walling AOR=0.052(0.004, 0.739) were associated factors with VL at 95&#x0025;CI with p-value&#x003C;0.05.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Male 15-64years were highly susceptible. Level of education, ITNs and walling were associated factors with VL. Formulating policies and guidelines for male 15-64 years related vector control and awareness creation regarding feeding habit of sand fly, prevention and control were recommended. Awareness of community on prevention method; using repellents, ITNs utilization, and safe sleeping mechanisms are mandatory. Further investigation on the issue is best remedy to overcome future VL outbreak occurrence.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Leishmaniasis is a protozoan disease caused by members of the genus <italic>Leishmania</italic>, parasites that infect numerous mammal species including humans, and transmitted by <italic>Phlebotomine</italic> sand-flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Leishmania species produce widely varying clinical syndromes ranging from self-healing cutaneous ulcers to fatal visceral disease with the syndromes fall into visceral leishmaniasis (VL), cutaneous leishmaniasis, and mucosal leishmaniasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Common symptoms of VL are prolonged fever, weight loss, signs of bone marrow invasion (anaemia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia), abdominal distension with hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Transmission may be anthroponomical or zoonotic. Human-to-human transmission via shared infected needles and in-utero transmission to the foetus occurs rarely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Although the distribution of Leishmania is limited by the distribution of sand-fly vectors, human leishmaniasis is on the increase worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). It affects the poorest and most marginalized people and is commonly associated with malnutrition, poor housing and weak immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Kala&#x2013;azar generally affects poor and neglected populations living in remote rural areas. If not treated, more than 95&#x0025; of Kala&#x2013;azar cases will eventually result in death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). In recent years, leishmaniasis outbreaks have been described with increasing frequency, including those in sub-tropical regions or regions not previously endemic across the global. In Brazil, beginning in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), There is reports outbreaks of VL in different parts of the world like Nepal from 2004 &#x2013; 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), China in 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), Kenya in 2008, 2011, 2013 and 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), Ethiopia in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) different site with different number of cases.</p>
<p>VL is considered among the most neglected tropical diseases (NTD), is one of several emerging diseases of major public health importance in Ethiopia. An estimated 3.2 million people are at risk of VL in Ethiopia and VL is endemic in six regions of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Based on the report of Oromia Regional Health Bureau NTD report; it is endemic in Borena, Guji and Bale Zones. Borena zone started reporting Leishmaniasis cases in 2012 from Arero, Dire and Miyo Districts. More cases are reported by Dire District and the problem expanded to additional districts and currently, cases are coming from six districts. The Zone Health Department (ZHD) reported relatively an increased number of suspected leishmaniasis cases in 2019, specifically from Magado Kebele.</p>
<p>Following reports of increased number of leishmaniasis cases in the zone, a team consisting of different experts drawn from Federal, Regional and WHO is established and deployed to the zone to provide technical support to ZHD from 14-25 October 2019. We conducted the investigation with a combination of epidemiological, entomological, and case control study and formed case definition by using a standard set of criteria to decide whether an individual should be classified as having the disease or not in this investigation. We further divided into two sub-teams each taking responsibility for case management and surveillance. The case management team dealt with verifications of case diagnosis, management and capacity building of health workers in Ya&#x2019;abal&#x2019;o hospital.</p>

<title>Case definition</title>
<p>A case definition is formed by using a standard set of criteria to verify and decide whether an individual should be classified as having the disease or not in this investigation. Usually includes four components:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>- Clinical information about the disease</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- Characteristics about the people who are affected</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- Information regarding the location or place</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- Specification of time during which the outbreak occurred</p></list-item>
</list>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>VL case definition</title>
<p>A person who presents with fever for more than two weeks and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) <bold>AND/OR</bold> Enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) <bold>OR</bold> either loss of weight, anaemia or leukopenia; while living in a known VL endemic area or having travelled to an endemic area.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Study area and period</title>
<p>The study was conducted in Borena Zone, Oromia Region. The area is bordered in North, West Guji Zone, in South bordering Kenya, in West, Somali Regional State and in the West with South Nations, Nationalities and People Regional State. The 2019 projected total population of the affected area was 219,809 and most of the residents of the zone were pastoralists and most Districts were low lands. Entomological and environmental parts of the study were conducted in Magado village in Dire District of Borena Zone, which is endemic for Malaria and other NTDs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>Descriptive design followed by case control study was conducted in the affected area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Descriptive studies</title>
<p>Based on case definition, we reviewed patients&#x2019; record from the health facilities to verify the cases. We included socio demographic variables such as age, sex, travel history, to endemic areas, vector control program, sleeping area/place, location, data of onset, date health facility visit and clinical information such as symptoms and treatment outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Analytical Epidemiology</title>
<p>The dependent variable for the study was verified VL cases while independent variable includes variables such as age, sex, marital status, educational status, occupation and economic characteristics. We used case control design with 95&#x0025; CI, 80&#x0025; power, 30.8&#x0025; controls exposure, and 3.73 odds ratio and with ratio of 1:2. All 33 verified cases and 66 controls were included in the study. We collected all variables&#x2019; information from cases admitted to hospital discharged using structured questionnaire by interviewing the patients, caregivers and respective control group selected from the same age group, sex and village. There may be limitation of recall bias from those returned to their home. All 99 study subjects were residents of Borena Zone for at least 2 years at time of diagnosis (cases) or at time of enrolment (controls). We included all cases of VL which fulfils cases definition, admitted to Ya&#x2019;abal&#x2019;o Hospital and discharged from 13th, July to 13th October, 2019. We entered the data to Epi info and exported to SPSS to analyse predictors using the logistic regression at significant value of P&#x003C;0.05. Variable those identified for eligibility of binary logistic regression model at p-vale of 0.05 were again tested for final model of multivariate logistic regression analysis.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Entomological and Environmental Study</title>
<p>We carried out collection of sand flies by using two CDC light trap and six sticky paper collection method for both indoor and outdoor to assess the biting and resting behavior of sand fly, species identification and parasite detection for environmental and entomological assessment. We also tried to identify environmental risk factors like availability of water sources, marshy areas, housing conditions, type of trees and domestic and/or wild animals by our visitation to Magado village in Dire district of Borena Zone. A total of 70 entomological specimens were collected. Out of the 70 specimens, 49 (70&#x0025;) were collected from outdoor near house, 15 (21&#x0025;) from bushes sites. Only 6 (9&#x0025;) of the specimens were collected from indoors. Though the sample was not adequate for justification, the density is high in outdoor near to house compound. All mounted sand fly specimens was used to identify vector species based on identification key. However, PCR analysis for parasite detection could was not conducted due to absence of necessary reagent (Leishmania primers).</p>

<p>Study participants with adult education are 30 times more likely to have VL than those of having higher educational level (95&#x0025; CI of AOR=2.378, 389.602), and similarly primary level of education are 13 times more likely to develop VL than those of having higher educational level (95&#x0025; CI of AOR=1.107, 168.565). HH heads not able to read and write 93&#x0025; less likely to be free from VL than those able to read and write (95&#x0025; CI of AOR=0.007,0.582) and not owning land is 72&#x0025; less likely to be free from VL than those owning land (95&#x0025; CI of AOR=0.078,0.996). Participants not having bed-nets are 9 times more likely to be infected with VL than those having bed-nets (95&#x0025; CI of AOR=1.763, 46.205). Living in house with walling of brick is 95&#x0025; less likely to be susceptible for VL infection than those living in house with walling of earth (mud)(<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Entomological findings</title>
<p>A total of 70 entomological specimens were collected. Out of the 70 specimens, 49 (70&#x0025;) were collected from outdoor sites and 15 (21&#x0025;) were from vegetation. Only 6 (9&#x0025;) of the specimens were collected from indoors. Though the sample was not adequate for justification, the density is 8-10 flies per A4 size slide in outdoor near to house compound. In Ele-Bora village black cotton soil is important breeding site for sand fly, the community prefers to sleep outside house due to hot climatic condition results in an increased risk of infection. However, 9&#x0025; sand fly was collected inside the houses, are not constructed well, have many holes in the wall, so it increases the risk of bite when a person sleeps even inside the house.</p>
<p>The descriptive part of our finding also shows among all study participants 68.7&#x0025; of them own dogs and 80.8&#x0025; of them respond that availability of &#x2018;Osole&#x2019; near their residential area. Both dogs and &#x2018;Osole&#x2019; are the reservoirs of sand flies. Additionally; acacia tree which is favorable for the breading of sand fly found in the area and 78.8&#x0025; of the respondents sleep under this tree during night time.</p>

<sec id="s3a9">
<title>Environmental findings</title>
<p>Based on the data registered in Ya&#x2019;abal&#x2019;o hospital shows high cases were from Dire District specifically from Magado Kebele. We tried to identify environmental risk factors for VL in Magado Kebele. Accordingly; there was a deep well water source project in Ele-Bora village having tankers and ditches without water which makes the surrounding favourable area for breading of sand flies. For the sake of water source project the community obliged to come and dwell in the area for grazing and getting water for their cattle. Additionally; the area is marshy/swampy during rain; when heavy rain passes the land become cracked and makes small holes which helps for breading of sand flies and related insects.</p>
<p>The walling of house made of wood and thatched having many holes, roofing from thatched and plastic material, and floor from earth not easily cleanable having cracks and holes. There were also acacia trees in the district which serves as shading from sunlight during day time and as a shelter near herd of cattle for young male during night time. There were domestic animals like dogs and wild animals like &#x201C;Osole&#x201D; inhabit in the area</p>

<sec id="s4">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The increment in the number of cases in July and August 2019 might be by the awareness raising activities in the community by the zone health department and respective Districts which can improve the care seeking behaviour of the community and the attention given for complete data recording in the current suspected outbreak.</p>
<p>The number of cases is pitched in Magado Kebele of Dire District. The possible cause for increased number of cases in Magado might be related to settlement of community near water point of Ele_Bora village which is favourable for breading of Sand Flies which are responsible vector for Leishmania infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Additionally the entomological information collected from Ele_Bora village also indicates the presence of sand fly in the village. More over all the cases from other District had travel history to the water point in Dire District.</p>
<p>The age groups highly affected were 15-64 years male due to high risk of exposure to the breading sites of sand fly during outside work activities; in similar way study conducted in North Ethiopia also shows higher number of VL cases were recorded above 14 years of age group, and studies in Libo Kemem showed that males were affected more than females. In contrast to our study the study conducted in South Sudan shows 56&#x0025; of the cases were under 5 years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The reason for difference could be behavioural and cultural difference between the communities. The reason for similarity of the studies might be due to culture and habits of the male were engaged to keep cattle; they sleep at night time outside the house near their cattle and stays under shed of trees at day time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Domestic animals like dog accompany them to keep their cattle during day and night, which are the factors for the transmission of Leishmaniasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The respondents also told that there are wild animals like &#x201C;Osole&#x201D; which are another risk factor for the transmission of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The result shows that the fatality rate is relatively high among child dependent age group. This might be due low immunity of children than the productive age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>Statistical analysis model we used shows that level of education of study participants were significantly associated with VL cases, which is similar with study conducted in North Ethiopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Similarly study conducted in North Ethiopia showed that educational level below grade five boosted VL odds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). In contrast to this there were no evidences shown in studies conducted in Nepal, South Sudan and Libo Kemkem of North West Ethiopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The difference might be due to socio cultural and geographical location difference of study areas.</p>
<p>We found that there is a strong association between VL and poor housing condition like walling material built from mud (earth)and similar study conducted in Nepal with those living in a thatched houses without windows having 3&#x2013;4 times higher odds of Kala-azar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In Spain also living in a detached house, were all strongly associated with the prevalence of asymptomatic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Cracked walls may be favourable area for the breading of and resting of sand flies and houses without window are free for the movement of vectors from outdoor to indoor flight. The study North Ethiopia also shows similar association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study also indicates that owning specific land has significant association with VL, and similarly study conducted in Shebelle, Somali Region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Previous outbreaks were often related to force migration of non-immune populations into endemic areas following conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The reason behind might be due to high mobility of the community for grazing and not expected to construct well designed house which hinders the movement and breading of sand fly.</p>
<p>Bed-net is other predictor that is associated to VL cases. Similarly studies proved that having bed nets and utilization of bed nets have significant association with the prevalence of this morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). This holds true that ITNs are protective factor for the sand flies mechanically as well as chemically by killing the vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). However, like IRS, the usefulness of Long Lasting ITNs very much depends on the biting behaviour of the vectors (indoor vs. outdoor). Another issue regarding the use of nets against sand flies is that much sand fly biting activity occurs during early evening between 19-21 o&#x2019;clock before most people go to sleep so that exposure to sand fly bites is only reduced but not eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>To conclude the findings: male productive age group were the affected group, level of education, ownership of land, having and utilization of bed nets and housing conditions are significantly associated with Visceral Leishmaniasis. Based on the main findings of our study we recommend that: formulating policies and guidelines on awareness creation for male productive age group regarding feeding habit of sand fly and prevention mechanisms control methods, Educating the community on prevention mechanisms like using repellents and safe sleeping mechanisms and additionally further investigation on the study area is the best remedy to overcome future VL outbreak occurrence.</p>
