<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The genetics underlying human longevity is influenced by the genetic risk to develop -or escape- age-related diseases. As Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD) represents one of the most common conditions at old age, an interplay between genetic factors for AD and longevity is expected.</p>
<p>We explored this interplay by studying the prevalence of 38 AD-associated single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in AD-GWAS, in self-reported cognitively healthy centenarians, and we replicated findings in the largest GWAS on parental-longevity.</p>
<p>We found that 28/38 SNPs identified to associate with increased AD-risk also associated with decreased odds of longevity. For each SNP, we express the imbalance between AD- and longevity-risk as an effect-size distribution. When grouping the SNPs based on these distributions, we found three groups: 17 variants increased AD-risk more than they decreased the risk of longevity (AD-group): these variants were functionally enriched for <italic>&#x03B2;</italic>-amyloid metabolism and immune signaling, and they were enriched in microglia. 11 variants reported a larger effect on longevity as compared to their AD-effect (Longevity-group): these variants were enriched for endocytosis/immune signaling, and at the cell-type level were enriched in microglia and endothelial cells. Next to AD, these variants were previously associated with other aging-related diseases, including cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Unexpectedly, 10 variants associated with an increased risk of both AD and longevity (Unexpected-group). The effect of the SNPs in AD- and Longevity-groups replicated in the largest GWAS on parental-longevity, while the effects on longevity of the SNPs in the Unexpected-group could not be replicated, suggesting that these effects may not be robust across different studies.</p>
<p>Our study shows that some AD-associated variants negatively affect longevity primarily by their increased risk of AD, while other variants negatively affect longevity through an increased risk of multiple age-related diseases, including AD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human lifespan is determined by a beneficial combination of environmental and genetic factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Long-lived individuals tend to cluster in families, suggesting that the role of the genetic factors is considerable,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> however, the research of genetic variants that influence human lifespan has yielded contrasting results: only the longevity-association of the <italic>APOE</italic> alleles and few additional variants consistently replicated across studies (<italic>CDKN2B, ABO</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> While the replication rate in independent studies is low, a large collection of genetic variants has been associated with longevity through genome-wide association studies (GWAS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> The majority of these variants was previously identified to associate with other age-related conditions, including cardiovascular disease, autoimmune and neurological disorders, suggesting that the genetics underlying human longevity depends on a low risk for several age-related diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of all age-related diseases, late-onset Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and one of the most prevalent causes of death at old age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> The largest risk factor for AD is aging: at 100 years of age, the disease&#x2019;s incidence is about 40&#x0025; per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Genetic factors play a significant role in AD as heritability was estimated to be 60&#x2013;80&#x0025;:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> the strongest common genetic risk factor for AD is the <italic>APOE</italic>-<italic>&#x03B5;4</italic> allele, and large collaborative GWAS have identified &#x223C;40 additional common variants associated with a slight modification of the risk of AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Despite high incidence rates of AD at very old ages, AD is not an inevitable consequence of aging, as demonstrated by individuals who surpass the age of 100 years with high levels of cognitive health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>As AD-associated variants increase the risk of AD, leading to earlier death, a negative effect on longevity for these variants is to be expected. However, apart from <italic>APOE</italic> alleles, genetic variants that influence the risk of AD were not found to affect the human lifespan in previous GWAS. When assuming that AD-associated variants affect AD only and that these variants&#x2019; effect is constant during aging, then the effect on longevity for these variants should be proportional to their effect on AD, albeit in a different direction. In other words, if a variant increases the risk of AD 2-fold, then carriers will have twice as much AD-related mortality as non-carriers, and as a consequence (given the assumptions), they will have twice as little chance to age into a cognitively healthy centenarian. For example, variant <italic>rs72824905</italic> (Pro522Arg) in the <italic>PLCG2</italic> gene was recently found to decrease the risk of AD 1.75-fold, 1.63-fold frontotemporal dementia, and 1.85-fold dementia with Lewy bodies, while being associated with a 1.49-fold increased likelihood of longevity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> For a variant that is protective against multiple conditions, it might be expected that the overall effect on longevity should be larger than the inverse of the effect on AD alone.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that cognitively healthy centenarians are depleted with genetic variants that increased the risk of AD compared to a general population; however, the extent of depletion was variant specific, suggesting that a subset of AD-variants may be specifically beneficial to reach extremely old ages in good cognitive health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> There is, however, little evidence of an age-dependent effect for AD variants and the extent to which these variants affect other age-related diseases is mostly unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Using the assumption of effect-size proportionality, we set out to investigate the relationship between AD- and longevity-risk for genetic variants associated with AD.</p>

<title>Populations and selection of genetic variants</title>
<p>We included N=358 centenarians from the 100-plus Study cohort, which comprises Dutch-speaking individuals aged 100 years or older who self-report to be cognitively healthy, which is confirmed by a proxy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> As population controls, we used population-matched, cognitively healthy individuals from five studies: (<italic>i</italic>) the Longitudinal Aging Study of Amsterdam (LASA, N=1,779),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> (<italic>ii</italic>) the memory clinic of the Alzheimer center Amsterdam and SCIENCe project (N=1,206),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> (<italic>iii</italic>) the Netherlands Brain Bank (N=40),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (<italic>iv</italic>) the twin study of Amsterdam (N=201)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and (<italic>v</italic>) the 100-plus Study (partners of centenarian&#x2019;s children, N=86).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> See <italic>Supplementary Methods: Populations</italic> for a detailed description of these cohorts. Throughout the manuscript, we will refer to the union of the individuals from these five studies as population subjects. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Amsterdam UMC (METC) approved all studies. All participants and/or their legal representatives provided written informed consent for participation in clinical and genetic studies.</p>
<p>Genetic variants in our populations were determined by standard genotyping and imputation methods. After establishing quality control of the genetic data (see <italic>Supplementary Methods: Quality control</italic>), 2,905 population subjects and 343 cognitively healthy centenarians were left for the analyses (<italic><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic>). We then selected 41 variants representing the current genetic landscape of AD (<italic>Table S1</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> We restricted our analysis to high-quality variants with a minor allele frequency &#x003E;1&#x0025; in our cohorts, which led to the exclusion of 3/41 variants (rare variants in the <italic>TREM2</italic> gene <italic>rs143332484</italic> and <italic>rs75932628</italic> and <italic>ABI3</italic> gene <italic>rs616338</italic>), leaving 38 variants for the analyses.</p>

<title>AD and longevity variant effect sizes</title>
<p>We first retrieved the effect-size on <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> for each AD variant, <italic>k</italic>, from a large genome-wide meta-analysis of AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> To estimate a confidence interval, we bootstrapped the published effect-sizes (log of odds ratios) and their respective standard errors (<italic>B</italic>=10,000).</p>
<p>To calculate the effect-size on longevity <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> for the same variants, we used a logistic regression model with cognitive healthy centenarians as cases and population subjects as controls while adjusting for population stratification (PC 1-5). The number of principal components to include as covariates was arbitrarily chosen; however, as all individuals were population-matched, we expected these components to correct all major population effects. The resulting <italic>p-values</italic> were corrected for multiple testing (False Discovery Rate, FDR). To calculate the confidence interval, we repeated this procedure for bootstraps (<italic>B</italic>=10,000) of the data. For convenience, variant effect-sizes on AD and longevity were calculated with respect to the allele that increases the risk of AD, such that <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline3.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>Given a variant <italic>k</italic>, with a relative effect-size on <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline4.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and on longevity <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, we defined that the variant has an <italic>expected direction</italic> if the variant increases the risk of AD, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and at the same time decreases the risk of longevity, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline7.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. Inversely, we define that the longevity effect has an <italic>unexpected direction</italic> if the allele that increased AD risk also increased the risk of longevity, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline8.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline9.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. The probability of observing an <italic>expected direction</italic> was considered a Bernoulli variable with <italic>p</italic>=0.5 (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. equal chance of having an <italic>expected/unexpected</italic> direction), thus the number of variants with an <italic>expected direction</italic> follows a binomial distribution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Imbalance of variant effect direction</title>
<p>We represented each variant as a data point whose coordinates were defined by the variant&#x2019;s effect on AD (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline10.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, on the y-axis) and its effect on longevity (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline11.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, on the x-axis). See <italic><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref></italic> for an example. For each variant, we then calculated the normalized angle, <italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>, of the vector representing the data point with the x-axis: <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline12.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, with <italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> &#x2208; [&#x2212;1; 1]. This normalized angle relates to the imbalance between the risk of AD and the risk of longevity. That is, for <italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> &#x003C; 0 the variant has an expected direction, while for <italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> &#x003E; 0 the variant has an unexpected direction.</p>
<p>As the effect-sizes are sample estimates, we subsequently took their confidence interval into account to create, for each variant, a distribution of the imbalance in the effect direction (<italic>IED</italic>). Hereto, we assumed a Gaussian density for both <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline13.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline14.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, centered around <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline15.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline16.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and with a variance equal to the estimated confidence interval for both effect sizes, respectively. We sampled 10,000 times from these distributions and calculated the corresponding imbalance (<italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>), to get a (non-Gaussian) distribution of the <italic>IED</italic> for that variant, <italic>IED</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>. To group variants with similar patterns of their <italic>IED</italic> distributions, we ordered the <italic>IED</italic> by their median value <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline17.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and defined a group of variants in which the effect sizes were in the expected direction <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline18.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, which we subsequently split in those that have (<italic>i</italic>) a larger effect on longevity as compared to the effect on AD (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline19.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, <italic>Longevity-group</italic>), and those that have (ii) a larger effect on AD as compared to the effect on longevity (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline20.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, <italic>AD-group</italic>). We defined a third group of variants that have an effect in the unexpected direction (<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline21.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, <italic>Unexpected</italic>-<italic>group</italic>).</p>

<title>Linking variants with functional clusters</title>
<p>To investigate each variant&#x2019;s functional consequences, we calculated the variant-pathway mapping, which indicates the degree of involvement of each genetic variant in AD-associated pathways (<italic><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></italic>). See <italic>Supplementary Methods: variant-pathway mapping</italic> for a detailed explanation of our approach. Briefly, the <italic>variant-pathway mapping</italic> depends on (<italic>i</italic>) the number of genes each variant was associated with and (ii) the biological pathways each gene was associated with. We calculated the variant-pathway mapping for all 38 AD-associated variants. Finally, we compared the variant-pathway mapping within each group of variants defined based on the <italic>IEDs</italic> (Longevity-, AD- and Unexpected-groups) using Wilcoxon sum rank tests and correcting <italic>p-values</italic> using FDR: this was indicative of whether a group of variants was enriched for a specific functional cluster (<italic><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Cell-type annotation at the level of each cluster</title>
<p>To further explore the biological basis of the different groups of variants (Longevity-, AD- and Unexpected-groups), we calculated the degree of enrichment of each group for specific brain cell-types (see <italic>Supplementary Methods: cell-type annotation</italic> for a detailed description).

<p>The 38 AD-associated variants included coding variants (N=10), intronic variants (N=20), and intergenic variants (N=8) (<italic>Table S3</italic>). 12/28 of the intronic/intergenic variants had eQTL associations.

<title>Summary of the findings</title>
<p>We studied the effect on longevity of 38 genetic variants previously associated with AD through GWAS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> We found that a majority of 74&#x0025; of the alleles that increase the risk of AD is associated with lower odds of becoming a centenarian (expected direction). Overall, most variants (N=17) had a larger effect on AD than on longevity: these variants were associated with <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> -amyloid metabolism and endocytosis/immune signaling, and were primarily expressed in microglia. A subset of variants (N=11) had a larger effect on longevity than their effect on AD. These variants were associated mostly with endocytosis and immune signaling, and they were expressed in microglia and endothelial cells. These variant-effects were confirmed for 81&#x0025; of the alleles in an independent dataset, the largest GWAS on parental longevity. In contrast, 26&#x0025; of the variants increased both the risk of developing AD <italic>and</italic> the risk of becoming a centenarian (n=10), (unexpected direction). These unexpected effects could only be replicated for 2 of the variants in the independent dataset, suggesting that the expected effects were more robust across studies than the unexpected effects. Together, our findings suggest that variants associated with AD-risk may also be linked with the risk of other age-related diseases, and that survival/longevity is affected by these variants.</p>

<title>AD-associated variants and their effect on healthy aging</title>
<p>A single study previously explored the extent to which 10 AD-associated variants affect longevity: apart from <italic>APOE</italic> locus, none of the other 10 tested AD-associated variants significantly associated with longevity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> In addition to <italic>APOE</italic>, four variants showed a negative effect on longevity while increasing AD-risk (in/near <italic>ABCA7, EPHA1, CD2AP</italic>, and <italic>CLU</italic>). In agreement with these findings, we also found that only the <italic>APOE</italic> variants significantly associated with longevity, and variants in/near <italic>EPHA1</italic> and <italic>CD2AP</italic> belong to the Longevity-group. However, in our study, we found that most alleles associated with an increased risk of AD associated with a decreased chance of longevity. The inability to observe such an inverse relationship between variant effects on AD and longevity in the previous study may be explained by the relatively small sample sizes, combined with a low number of (well-established) AD variants analyzed (N=10). In our study, groups sizes were also relatively small, but the centenarians had a relatively high level of cognitive health, which might have contributed to an increased effect size of AD-associated genetic variants in our comparison.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>For most variants with effects in the expected direction, the risk-increasing effect on AD was more extensive than the negative effect on survival/longevity. These variants, which include both <italic>APOE</italic> alleles, might negatively affect lifespan because carriers are removed from the population with increasing age due to AD-associated mortality. For the <italic>APOE</italic> variants specifically, the distribution of the imbalance in the effect directions suggests a nearly similar proportion of the increased risk of AD and decreased risk of longevity for both <italic>APOE</italic> variants <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21250991v1_inline26.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. This explains why multiple previous studies have associated <italic>APOE</italic> variants with longevity. In our cohort of centenarians, the frequency of the deleterious <italic>&#x03B5;4</italic> allele is half of that of the population controls (8&#x0025; <italic>vs</italic>. 16&#x0025;, respectively). In comparison, the frequency of the protective <italic>&#x03B5;2</italic> allele is nearly two-fold increased (16&#x0025; <italic>vs</italic>. 9&#x0025;).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Note, however, that inclusion criteria of the centenarian cohort required them to self-report to be cognitively healthy, which might have increased the observed longevity effect. Apart from the <italic>APOE</italic> variants, the AD-group included 15 variants, all of which were among the first to be associated with AD through GWAS (<italic>CR1, CD33, BIN1, MS4A6A, PICALM</italic>, and <italic>SLC24A4</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> These common variants have the strongest associations with AD: largest odds ratios (OR) leading to lowest <italic>p</italic>-values. Functional annotation showed significant enrichment of <italic>&#x03B2;</italic>-amyloid metabolism, which aligns with the importance of functional APP metabolism in maintaining brain health. We also observed functional enrichment of endocytosis and immune signaling, and a specific cell-type enrichment for microglia.

<title>Variants with a larger effect on longevity than AD</title>
<p>The second-largest group of variants constituted a subset of 11 variants with a larger effect on longevity than the effect on AD, which suggests that these variants may be involved in other age-related diseases or general age-related processes. The AD-association of most of these variants is relatively recent, likely due to small effect sizes (ORs) or variants rareness (low minor allele frequency, MAF); both features necessitate a very large number of samples to identify these variants as significantly associating with the disease.

<title>Variants associated with increased risk of AD and increased longevity risk: unexpected group</title>
<p>Unexpectedly, ten variants increased the risk of AD while at the same time increasing the chance to reach ages over 100 in good cognitive health, which is an <italic>unexpected</italic> balance. We note that the <italic>IED</italic> distributions of these variants were broad, and in some cases even showed a bimodal behavior (in/near <italic>KANSL1, IL34, CHRNE</italic>): this is attributable to the small effect-sizes (and large standard errors) on longevity for these variants, which caused data points to easily flip between the expected and unexpected direction during the sampling procedure.

<p>An alternative explanation may be that these variants have age-dependent effects: for example, high blood pressure at midlife increases the risk of AD, but after the age of 85 a high blood pressure protects against AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> Similarly, a high body-mass-index (BMI) increases the risk of AD at midlife, while being protective at older ages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> In line with this hypothesis, the AD variant in/near <italic>IL34</italic> gene codes for a cytokine that is crucial for the differentiation and the maintenance of microglia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> Although further studies are needed, an excessive differentiation in middle-age individuals may increase brain-related inflammation and AD-risk, while it might compensate for the slower differentiation and immune activity at very old ages.

This phenotype is rare, and individuals need to be individually approached for study inclusion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> which is prohibitive for large sample collection. As population subjects in our comparison, we used individuals from five different cohorts: all from the same (Dutch) population, all tested cognitively intact, and did not convert to dementia at the time of analyses. Analyses of variants with low sample sizes in small samples lead to effect sizes large confidence intervals: we took this uncertainty into account by bootstrapping effect sizes, causing the distributions of the imbalance in the variant effect direction of several variants to be widely spread. Although our work represents a first step towards understanding the effect of AD-associated variants on longevity, similar analyses in larger oldest-old or centenarian samples are necessary to support our findings further. Secondly, we had to deal with the problem in GWAS studies, that the driving effect underlying the AD-association of each variant is unclear. Several genes usually map to a specific GWAS locus, represented by one variant. Therefore, to accommodate this uncertainty, we allowed multiple genes mapping to the GWAS locus to be associated with each variant. The subsequent functional annotation of these genes is mainly dependent on the current (limited) knowledge about variant effect and genes function. It is thus likely that our variant-function annotation will change as we gain more understanding about these variant-gene-effects, as well as annotations of gene-functions. When we inspected the parental-longevity GWAS, most of the variants that were in the <italic>expected direction</italic> in our study were also in the same direction in the GWAS; however, this was not true for all variants. The variant that deviated the most between our study and the parental-longevity GWAS was <italic>rs9275152</italic> in the <italic>HLA</italic> region: while we clustered this variant in the Longevity-group, in the parental-longevity GWAS the direction of effect was opposite (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e. unexpected</italic>), suggesting that the variant increased the risk of AD and at the same time the chance of a long lifespan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> The genomic region to which <italic>HLA</italic> maps is biologically known to be affected by many recombination events and may be population- and environment-dependent, which may explain this divergence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> In addition to <italic>HLA</italic>-variant, variant <italic>rs34674752</italic> in the <italic>SHARPIN</italic> gene reported the second-largest effect-size in our study (after <italic>APOE-&#x03B5;4</italic>), while the effect-size of this variant in the GWAS was very small, yet in the <italic>expected direction</italic>. To this end, we note that the individuals used in the parental-longevity GWAS were themselves not extremely old individuals, such that possible pleiotropic effects at very old ages, as described earlier, may not be observable in this GWAS. However, while we observed overall consistency in effect-size direction for variants in the expected direction, 6/8 of the variants in the unexpected direction were in the expected direction in the GWAS, with variants near <italic>SORL1, IL34</italic>, and <italic>ADAM10</italic> having the most noticeable differences. We speculate that the relatively young ages of the GWAS samples, together with the small sample size of our centenarian cohort may be the cause of such discrepancy.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Each AD-associated variant has a different effect on longevity. Variants that have a larger effect on longevity than on AD were previously associated as disease risk-factors, and associated genes are selectively enriched for endocytosis and immune signaling functions.</p>

<caption><title>Explanation of the distribution of imbalance variant effect direction (IED).</title>
<p>The figure shows the sequential steps for constructing the distribution of the expected direction of variant effect for AD-risk compared to longevity for two toy variants (<italic>SNP</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>SNP</italic><sub>2</sub>). <bold>A</bold>. Axes definition, with the y-axis being the effect-size for AD-risk (log of odds ratio) of a variant, derived from literature and set positive by definition. The x-axis identifies the effect-size of a variant on longevity. This can be either positive or negative depending on the variant&#x2019;s association in cognitively healthy centenarians as opposed to population subjects. The blue area represents that the two effects are in the expected direction with respect to each other, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. a variant increases the risk of AD and at the same time decreases the chance of longevity. Oppositely, the grey area refers to the unexpected direction of effect. <bold>B</bold>. Two toy variants (<italic>SNP</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>SNP</italic><sub>2</sub>) are shown as data points. <italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sub>1&#x2212;2</sub> represents the angle of the data point vector with the x-axis. <bold>C</bold>. Normalization of the <italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sub>1&#x2212;2</sub> value into an arbitrary space. Here, we used [&#x2212;1; 1]. <bold>D</bold>. Repeating this procedure for each bootstrap iteration of each variant, we obtained the distribution of imbalance effect direction for each variant (<italic>IED</italic>). Values smaller than 0 indicate the <italic>expected direction</italic> of effect, whereas values larger than 0 refer to the <italic>unexpected direction</italic> of effects. Additionally, values close to 0 indicate a larger AD effect than longevity effect, and values close to -1 suggest that the variant&#x2019;s longevity effect is larger than the AD effect.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Schematic representation of the variant-pathway and variant-cell-type mapping.</title>
<p>The figure shows a schematic representation of the annotation framework used to functionally annotate AD-associated variants and perform cell-type enrichment. Outputs are represented as blue squares, while methods are represented in orange. In the variant-gene mapping, showed in the grey box, we start from a list of variants and, through the integration of predicted variant consequences (CADD), eQTL and position, we obtain a list of genes. Note that here multiple genes may be associated with each variant. The yellow box shows the gene-pathway mapping: briefly, we perform gene-set enrichment analysis followed by clustering of the significantly enriched pathways to obtain functional clusters. We then calculate the gene-pathway mapping by looking at the (enriched) pathways associated with each gene and their associated functional clusters to get a weight for each gene-functional cluster association. Finally, we average the gene-pathway mapping of each gene associated with the same variant. Imputation methods (k-NN) are implemented for genes with missing annotation to obtain the gene-pathway mapping. Together, the grey box and the yellow box form the variant-pathway mapping. At the bottom, the green box shows the gene-cell-type enrichment using the public dataset GSE73721 of gene expression in different brain cell-types. Similar to the gene-pathway mapping, we calculate a weight of association of each gene to each cell-type, and we average these weights in case multiple genes mapped to the same variant (variant-cell-type mapping).</p></caption>

<title>Genotyping and imputation</title>
<p>Genetic variants in our populations were determined by standard genotyping and imputation methods, and we applied established quality control methods: we genotyped all individuals with the Illumina Global Screening Array (GSAsharedCUSTOM_20018389_A2) and excluded individuals with low-quality genotypes (individual call rate &#x003C;98&#x0025;, variant call rate &#x003C;98&#x0025;), individuals with sex mismatches and variants deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>p</italic>&#x003C;1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>). Genotypes were prepared for imputation comparing variants identifiers, strand and allele frequencies to the Haplotype Reference Panel (HRC v1.1, April 2016), and all remaining variants were submitted to the Sanger imputation server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imputation.sanger.ac.uk">https://imputation.sanger.ac.uk</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> The server uses EAGLE2 (v2.0.5) to phase the data, and imputation to the reference panel was performed with PBWT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> Before analysis, we excluded individuals of non-European ancestry and individuals with a family relation, leaving 2,905 population subjects and 343 cognitively healthy centenarians for the analysis.</p>

<title>Variant-gene mapping</title>
<p>We annotated each variant to the likely affected gene(s), so-called <italic>variant-gene mapping</italic>, combining annotation from <italic>Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion</italic> (CADD, v1.3), <italic>expression-quantitative-trait-loci</italic> in the blood (eQTL from GTEx v8), and positional mapping (from RefSeq build 98).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> In the case of coding variants, we confidently associated the variant with the corresponding gene. Alternatively, we first considered possible eQTL associations. When these were not available, we included all genes at increasing distance <italic>d</italic> from the variant (starting with <italic>d</italic> &#x2264; 50<italic>kb</italic>, up to <italic>d</italic> &#x2264; 500<italic>kb</italic>, increasing by 50<italic>kb</italic> until at least 1 gene was found). Our procedure allows the association of each variant with one or multiple genes (<italic><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></italic>).</p>

<sec id="s10d">
<title>Gene-pathway mapping</title>
<p>The resulting list of genes was used to find the molecular pathways enriched in the AD variants. See <italic><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></italic> for a schematic representation of our annotation framework. We realized that allowing multiple genes to associate with each variant could result in an enrichment bias, as neighboring genes are often functionally related. To control this, we implemented a sampling technique: at each iteration, we (<italic>i)</italic> sampled one gene from the pool of genes associated with each variant, and (<italic>ii</italic>) performed a gene-set enrichment analysis with the resulting list of genes. The gene-set enrichment analysis was performed considering biological processes (BP) and implemented with the <italic>enrichGO</italic> function of the R package <italic>clusterProfiler</italic>, with all genes as background and correcting p-values controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Finally, we averaged p-values for each enriched term over the iterations (N=1,000). To facilitate interpretation, we merged significantly enriched biological processes. First, we calculated the semantic similarity between all significant biological processes (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. FDR&#x003C;5&#x0025;) using <italic>Lin</italic> as a distance measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> We then applied hierarchical clustering on the resulting distance matrix and selected the number of functional clusters using the dynamic tree-cut method as implemented in <italic>cutreeDynamic</italic> function from the R package <italic>WGCNA</italic>, specifying 15 as the minimum number of terms per cluster (using the default value of 20 resulted in 2 functional clusters only). To provide an interpretation of each functional cluster, we selected the most frequent words describing the biological processes underlying each cluster, and show this as word-clouds as implemented in R package <italic>wordcloud2</italic>. Finally, by counting how often a functional cluster was associated with a gene, we could calculate a weighted annotation of each gene to the 4 functional clusters, so-called gene-pathway mapping (<italic><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Due to the initial selection of significantly enriched BP, not every gene in the list of variant-associated genes is annotated with (at least one of) these terms. Consequently, these genes could not be related to the final functional clusters. To overcome this, we connect these genes to the functional clusters using a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) imputation. The k-NN model was initially trained using the functional clusters as classes and the semantic similarity matrix between the enriched biological processes as features (<italic>feature terms</italic>). Then, for each gene with missing annotation, we (<italic>i</italic>) extracted all the biological processes the gene is involved in (<italic>input biological processes</italic>), and (<italic>ii</italic>) calculated the semantic similarity matrix between these terms and the <italic>feature terms</italic>, which defines the similarity between the <italic>input biological processes</italic> and the <italic>feature terms</italic>. Finally, we (<italic>iii</italic>) predicted the probability of classification of the similarity matrix to the classes (functional clusters), and used this as weight for the gene-pathway mapping (<italic><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></italic>).</p>

<title>Variant-pathway mapping</title>
<p>The variant-pathway mapping represents the combined annotation of each variant to the different functional clusters. As such, it depends on the variant-gene mapping and the gene-pathways mapping. Briefly, given a variant <italic>k</italic>, we (<italic>i</italic>) retrieved all the genes that were associated with the variant in the variant-gene mapping, <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>, and (<italic>ii</italic>) retrieved all the biological processes (gene ontology term identifiers) that were associated with these genes, <italic>GO</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>. Because we clustered biological processes into functional clusters, by looking at which functional clusters the <italic>GO</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> belonged to, we could assign a weight of association for variant <italic>k</italic> to each of the functional clusters.</p>

<title>Variant-cell-type mapping</title>
<p>To study brain-specific cell-types and their relationship with AD-associated variants, we used the publicly available gene expression dataset GSE73721: this dataset includes gene expression values of 6 fetal astrocyte samples, 12 adult astrocyte samples, 8 sclerotic hippocampal samples, 4 whole human cortex samples, 4 adult mouse astrocyte samples, and 11 human samples of other purified central-nervous-system (CNS) cell-types. We restricted to the gene expression of 12 astrocyte samples and 11 samples of purified CNS cell-types from the cortex of adult humans (total N=23, mean age of 41.5&#x00B1;19.6 years). To calculate the variant-cell-type mapping, we averaged the gene expression of the genes mapping to the same variant.</p>
