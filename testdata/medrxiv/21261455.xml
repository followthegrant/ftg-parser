<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We have performed genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses using publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to identify endometrial cancer risk factors. These and previously established risk factors of endometrial cancer were then included in a multi-trait Bayesian GWAS analysis to detect endometrial cancer susceptibility variants, identifying three novel loci (7q22.1, 8q24.3 and 16q12.2); two of which were replicated in an independent endometrial cancer GWAS dataset. These loci are hypothesized to affect endometrial cancer risk through altered sex-hormone levels or through effects on obesity. Consistent with this hypothesis, several genes with established roles in these pathways (<italic>CYP11B1, CYP3A7, IRX3 and IRX5</italic>) were prioritized as candidate endometrial cancer risk genes by interrogation of quantitative trait loci data and chromatin capture assays in endometrial cell lines. The findings of this study identify additional opportunities for hormone treatment and further support weight loss to reduce the risk of developing endometrial cancer.</p><sec>

<p>This study prioritizes four genes related to testosterone and obesity as candidate endometrial cancer risk genes, as well as identifies additional opportunities for hormone treatment and further supports weight loss to reduce endometrial cancer risk.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endometrial cancer is the fifth most common female cancer worldwide and the most common gynecological tumor in industrialized countries, accounting for over 380,000 new cases and nearly 90,000 deaths in 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In addition, its prevalence and mortality rate are increasing in both high- and low-income countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Identification of genetic susceptibility loci lays a foundation for the understanding of cancer etiology. Using case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from multiple studies in the Endometrial Cancer Association Consortium (ECAC), we have identified 16 loci significantly associated with endometrial cancer risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Together, these risk loci are estimated to explain approximately a quarter of the familial relative risk attributable to common, readily-imputable variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, indicating a large proportion of common endometrial cancer risk variants are still unidentified.</p>
<p>Endometrial cancer risk is influenced by many factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. A series of Mendelian randomization studies, which use trait-associated genetic variants to infer causal relationships, have confirmed known and identified new endometrial cancer risk factors, including increased body mass index (BMI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, early onset menarche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, low sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), high testosterone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, increased serum estradiol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, increased fasting insulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and decreased low- (LDL) and increased high-density lipoproteins (HDL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A recently developed multi-trait GWAS approach, the Bayesian GWAS (bGWAS) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, uses priors derived from Mendelian randomization analyses of risk factors in a Bayesian framework to identify genetic variants associated with a trait of interest (focal trait). This approach not only offers an opportunity to identify novel genetic loci associated with a trait, but also provides an insight into which trait-associated loci for a given risk factor(s) could act through to affect the focal trait. The utility of this approach has been demonstrated in identifying new loci associated with lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we used GWAS summary-level data of diverse traits from the UK Biobank and other consortia to identify risk factors for endometrial cancer via genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses. We implemented bGWAS to identify new endometrial cancer risk loci and to explore which risk factor pathways could mediate the effects of individual loci. Novel loci were assessed for replication in independent endometrial cancer GWAS datasets and functional interpretation provided to further our understanding of endometrial cancer etiology.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>GWAS Summary Statistics</title>
<p>GWAS summary statistics of endometrial cancer risk were from the latest ECAC GWAS analysis (12,906 cases and 108,979 controls)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. To avoid bias due to overlapping sample sets, UK Biobank samples were removed from the ECAC summary statistics for Mendelian randomization and bGWAS analyses, resulting in 12,270 endometrial cancer cases and 46,126 controls. Secondary analyses were also performed using GWAS summary statistics restricted to endometrioid endometrial cancer histology only (8,758 cases and 46,126 controls).</p>
<p>GWAS summary statistics for potential risk factors were from publicly available resources, including the UK Biobank GWAS datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> analyzed by the Neale laboratory (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/">http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/</ext-link>), MAGIC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://magicinvestigators.org/">https://magicinvestigators.org/</ext-link>), GLGC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lipidgenetics.org/">http://lipidgenetics.org/</ext-link>), the GWAS Catalog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/</ext-link>), BCAC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bcac.ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/">http://bcac.ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/</ext-link>), and the ReproGen Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reprogen.org">https://www.reprogen.org</ext-link>). Given endometrial cancer occurs only in women, where available we used female-stratified GWAS data. Sex-combined GWAS summary statistics were used for traits where female-stratified GWAS summary statistics were not available. Duplicated traits were excluded manually. Further information for trait GWAS summary statistics used in this study is provided in <bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Genetic Correlation</title>
<p>Genetic correlations between endometrial cancer risk and available traits were estimated using publicly available GWAS summary statistics and LD score regression (LDSC version 1.0.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Significant correlations were defined as those with a false discovery rate (FDR) &#x003C; 0.01. Since BMI is established to be the strongest risk factor for endometrial cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and many traits are correlated with BMI, we additionally estimated the genetic correlation between potential risk factors and endometrial cancer risk after adjusting for BMI. Adjustment for BMI was conducted by fitting the female-stratified UK Biobank GWAS summary statistics of BMI as a covariate of the analysis of endometrial cancer using GWAS summary-level data using the mtCOJO method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> implemented in GCTA (version 1.91.7beta)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was estimated using individual genotypic data from a random set of 10,000 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank cohort (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/</ext-link>) selected by Kho et al. (2020)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Mendelian Randomization Analysis</title>
<p>Traits that remained significantly genetically correlated with endometrial cancer after adjusting for BMI were assessed for endometrial cancer causality using two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses. Independent genetic variants robustly associated with individual traits (P &#x003C; 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>) were selected as instrumental variables using the stepwise model selection procedure implemented by the GCTA-COJO function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Default settings were used apart from --cojo-wind, which was set to 1000. A/T or C/G allelic variants with minor allele frequency larger than 0.42 were excluded from analyses due to the ambiguity into the identity of the effect allele in the exposure and outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Mendelian randomization analyses were performed using the TwoSampleMR R package (version 0.5.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. As the GWAS analyses of endometrial, breast, and ovarian cancers included shared control participants, the latter two cancers were excluded from the Mendelian randomization analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Bayesian Genome-wide Association Study (bGWAS)</title>
<p>Multi-trait GWAS analysis of endometrial cancer was conducted using the bGWAS framework implemented in R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Traits included in the bGWAS analysis can be found in <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>. These included traits found to be causally associated with endometrial cancer risk in this study plus risk factors reported by previous Mendelian randomization analyses (i.e. BMI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, testosterone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, estradiol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, age at menarche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, HDL-cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and LDL-cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>). Breast and ovarian cancers were excluded from this analysis due overlapping control participants with the endometrial cancer GWAS dataset as mentioned above.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The bGWAS method involves two main steps: (1) identification of independent risk factors that jointly affect endometrial cancer risk; and (2) determination of variant-trait associations by multi-trait GWAS using risk factors identified in step 1. Specifically, in the first step, univariate regression analyses were conducted to identify endometrial cancer risk factors using instrumental variables associated with traits (P &#x003C; 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>). Instrumental variables were considered independent if their physical distances were over 500 kb. Risk factors identified by univariate regression analyses were subsequently included in a multivariate Mendelian randomization analysis to determine independent risk factors of endometrial cancer via a stepwise selection procedure. In the second step, prior effects of individual variants were estimated as the sum of the products of the variant effects on individual risk factors and the causal effects of individual risk factors on endometrial cancer risk. Bayesian factors (BFs) and the corresponding p-value (P<sub>BF</sub>) were calculated. Significant associations identified based on BFs represent variants exerting their effects on endometrial cancer risk through risk factors included in the analysis. Direct and posterior effects and their corresponding p-values were also estimated. Variants showing a significant association by direct effects are likely to affect endometrial cancer risk directly or through other risk factors not included in the analysis; whereas variants displaying large prior effects, driven by one or more risk factors, could show significant posterior effects. A genome-wide significance threshold (P &#x003C; 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>) was used to identify significant variant-trait associations. We highlighted potential endometrial cancer risk loci if a genome-wide significant signal was observed more than 500 kb from a known endometrial cancer risk locus.</p>
<p>To identify potential subtype-specific loci, we performed an additional bGWAS analysis using the endometrioid endometrial cancer risk GWAS summary statistics. This was performed as above, apart from the threshold used for instrumental variable inclusion (P &#x003C; 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>, instead of 1 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>) because of the improved correlation between prior and observed effects of genetic variants (<bold>Supplementary Table S2</bold>).</p>
<p>To minimize false positives, following bGWAS analysis, the following criteria were applied to restrict output variants: (1) concordant direction of effect on endometrial cancer risk in this study and in the most recent ECAC GWAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and (2) a nominally significant association (P &#x003C; 0.05) with endometrial cancer risk in the most recent ECAC GWAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Endometrial Cancer GWAS Replication</title>
<p>To construct a replication set and validate our findings from the bGWAS analysis, we downloaded publicly available endometrial cancer GWAS summary statistics which were not included in the ECAC GWAS data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. These were from the Finnish biobank study, FinnGen (data freeze 2, 566 cases and 75,822 controls; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://r2.finngen.fi/">http://r2.finngen.fi/</ext-link>), and from the Japanese Biobank study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> (999 cases and 89,731 controls; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jenger.riken.jp/en/">http://jenger.riken.jp/en/</ext-link>). Endometrial cancer GWAS summary statistics from the Manchester cohort (UK) were provided by collaboration (560 cases and 1,202 controls)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Since the UK Biobank endometrial cancer case-control samples were excluded from the bGWAS analysis, we additionally included UK Biobank samples in our replication set. In total, 1,866 endometrial cancer cases were identified from UK Biobank (phenotype data accessed November 2020) using ICD10 code C54 in data fields 40006, 41270 and 41202. Genotypes for these women were extracted, with 18,660 non-related, randomly-selected women participants. Case-control GWAS analyses for this subset of UK Biobank participants were performed by REGENIE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, using a logistic mixed model including the genetic relationship matrix as a random effect to account for cryptic relatedness and population stratification. The top ten principal components and genotyping array were included as covariates in the model. Before analysis, quality control was performed to remove variants with a minor allele frequency &#x003C; 1&#x0025;, minor allele count &#x003C; 100, genotype missingness &#x003E; 10&#x0025; and those that deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<sub>HWE</sub> &#x003C; 1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup>).</p>
<p>Summary statistics for each set were harmonized to the same genomic build (hg19) and variants with low minor allele frequency (&#x003C; 1&#x0025;) or low imputation quality (R<sup>2</sup> &#x003C; 0.3) were removed. The summary statistics from the four sets were combined in a fixed-effects, inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis by METAL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (version release 2020-05-05), adjusting each set for genomic control.</p>

<title>In silico Functional Analysis</title>
<p>For each locus identified using BFs, candidate causal endometrial cancer risk variants were defined as those with a P<sub>BF</sub> 100:1 log likelihood ratio with the lead risk variant and located within &#x00B1;500 kb of the lead variant. Candidate causal risk variants were interrogated with the Qtlizer tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> to identify variants that were lead expression QTLs in GTEx tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Genes encompassing candidate causal risk variants were browsed in the GTEx web portal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> to identify lead splicing QTLs among the candidate causal set of risk variants.

<p>After adjusting for BMI, endometrial cancer risk significantly correlated with 24 traits (P &#x003C; 7.46 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup>; Bonferroni threshold = 0.05/67 significantly correlated traits before BMI adjustment) (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>).The magnitude and significance level of these adjusted correlations were attenuated, with the exception of breast and ovarian cancers, which were slightly strengthened.

<title>Identification of endometrial cancer risk factors</title>
<p>Although breast and ovarian cancers were genetically correlated with endometrial cancer risk after adjustment for BMI, they were excluded from Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses due to overlapping control participants with the endometrial cancer GWAS violating the principles of this analysis. Of the remaining 22 BMI-adjusted correlated traits, all but leg fat ratio and metabolic syndrome displayed significant effects on endometrial cancer risk by inverse variance weight (IVW) Mendelian randomization analyses (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplementary Table S4</bold>). Two of the 20 traits were found to reduce endometrial cancer risk: later relative age of first facial hair (OR 0.70; 95&#x0025; CI 0.52-0.95; P = 0.02), and increased sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels (OR 0.85; 95&#x0025; CI 0.79-0.92; P = 2.41 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>). The remaining 18 traits were found to increase endometrial cancer risk, with odd ratios varying from 1.20 (95&#x0025; CI 1.09-1.33; p = 1.95 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup>) for increased whole body water mass to 1.67 (95&#x0025; CI 1.44-1.95; p = 2.83 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;11</sup>) for increased left arm fat mass. Horizontal pleiotropy tests showed that Mendelian randomization results were not confounded by horizontal pleiotropy (MR-Egger intercept P-value &#x003E; 0.05) (<bold>Supplementary Table S4</bold>).</p>
<p>After BMI adjustment, increased SHBG level was the only trait that maintained a significant effect reducing endometrial cancer risk (OR 0.86; 95&#x0025; CI 0.80-0.93; P = 1.42 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup>) (<bold>Supplementary Table S4</bold>). The effect was similar to that before BMI adjustment, indicating the protective effect of increased SHBG levels on reducing endometrial cancer risk is independent of BMI.</p>

<title>Identification of independent endometrial cancer risk factors and multi-trait GWAS</title>
<p>Together with the 20 risk factors identified above, six additional endometrial cancer risk factors reported previously based on genetic analysis (i.e. BMI, testosterone levels, estradiol levels, age at menarche, HDL-cholesterol levels, and LDL-cholesterol levels) were included in the multi-trait GWAS analysis of endometrial cancer (<bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>). Multivariate Mendelian randomization analyses found four independent risk factors jointly displaying a significant effect on endometrial cancer risk: testosterone levels, SHBG levels, BMI, and age at menarche (<bold>Supplementary Figure S2A</bold>). We additionally performed multivariate Mendelian randomization analyses restricting to endometrioid endometrial cancer only and found testosterone, SHBG levels, BMI, and relative age of first facial hair to independently affected endometrioid endometrial cancer risk (<bold>Supplementary Figure S2B</bold>). This was not substantially different from the primary analysis of endometrial cancer risk as relative age of first facial hair (found to affect endometrioid endometrial cancer risk) belonged to the same cluster of traits as age at menarche (found to affect endometrial cancer risk) (<bold>Supplementary Figure S3</bold>).</p>
<p>Multi-trait GWAS analyses were conducted by bGWAS using priors constructed from the above endometrial cancer risk factors. The primary bGWAS analysis is based on Bayes factors (BFs), and identifies variants significantly associated with endometrial cancer predisposition through the risk factors included in the analysis. We also assessed direct effects from bGWAS analysis, which identifies variants likely to affect endometrial cancer risk directly, or through risk factors not included in the multi-trait GWAS analysis. As a secondary analysis, we considered variants identified by bGWAS posterior effects, which identifies associations displaying very large prior effects. These are associations which are largely driven by the relationship between the variant and at least one risk factor.</p>
<p>Our primary multi-trait BF GWAS analysis detected five loci associated with endometrial cancer risk (P<sub>BF</sub> &#x003C; 5 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>; <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>), two of which were known risk loci (12q24.12 and 15q15.1). The other three loci (7q22.1, 8q24.3, and 16q12.2) have not previously been reported as genome-wide significant endometrial cancer risk loci, although 7q22.1 has been reported as a sub-genome-wide significant endometrial cancer risk locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The four risk factors all contributed prior effects on endometrial cancer risk at the five loci (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>), with three risk loci (7q22.1, 8q24.3, 15q15.1) significantly associated with testosterone levels.

<p>We assessed quantitative trait loci (QTL) data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx v8) project to determine whether candidate causal risk variants (determined using 100:1 log likelihood ratios; <bold>Supplementary Table S7</bold>) at the three novel loci identified by the primary BF analysis also represented associations with gene expression or splicing.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using genetic correlation, Mendelian randomization and multi-trait GWAS approaches we have identified novel endometrial cancer risk loci, and highlighted factors underlying endometrial cancer development. Genetic correlation analyses found a large number of traits to be significantly correlated with endometrial cancer predisposition, 24 of which remained significant after adjusting for the BMI. Mendelian randomization analyses found 90&#x0025; of these to be likely causal for endometrial cancer development, although only the relationship for SHBG levels remained significant after adjusting for BMI. Using priors from multivariate Mendelian randomization analyses in a multi-trait BF GWAS approach, we detected three novel endometrial cancer risk loci, two of which replicated in an independent dataset. Secondary analysis using multi-trait posterior effects GWAS analysis highlighted another 15 potential endometrial cancer risk loci for further investigation.</p>
<p>Identifying genetically correlated traits can provide useful etiological insights into endometrial cancer and priorities likely causal relationships. Therefore, a fundamental goal of endometrial cancer epidemiology is to understand its relationships with other complex human phenotypes. One of our previous studies identified 14 non-cancer traits that were significantly correlated with endometrial cancer, all of which are either a proxy trait for obesity or are strongly and significantly genetically correlated with BMI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. By using the expanded number of traits in the UK Biobank and other consortia, we found 65 non-cancer phenotypes and 2 cancers (breast and ovarian cancers) that were genetically correlated with endometrial cancer. However, genetic correlation with endometrial cancer is subject to genetic confounding; for instance, traits might be genetically with endometrial cancer via their correlations with BMI. This was the case for about two thirds (43) of the 67 traits, as demonstrated by the observation that only 24 traits were still significantly genetically correlated with endometrial cancer after adjustment for BMI, most of which were related to body composition. These results support the previous assumption that although BMI is widely used as a proxy measure for obesity, the aspect of body composition most relevant for endometrial cancer risk is only partially captured by BMI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In addition, genetic variation associated with traits not related to BMI, such as SHBG levels and relative age of first facial hair, were also shown to be significantly genetically correlated with endometrial cancer risk.</p>
<p>To date, Mendelian randomization approaches have identified several factors that affect endometrial cancer risk, including estradiol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, age at menarche<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, HDL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, LDL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, testosterone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and SHBG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In this study, besides anthropometric traits, we also found that genetic propensity for non-anthropometric traits affected endometrial cancer risk, including SHBG and previously unreported traits such as basal metabolic rate and relative age of first facial hair. Propensity for increased SHBG levels and relative age of first facial hair provided protective effects on endometrial cancer risk, which was consistent with their negative genetic correlations with endometrial cancer.</p>
<p>Our primary multi-trait BF GWAS analysis identified three novel risk loci for endometrial cancer, two of which replicated in an independent dataset (7q22.1 and 8q24.3). Both of these novel endometrial cancer risk loci harbor genes encoding enzymes that metabolize testosterone (<italic>CYP3A7</italic> and <italic>CYP11B1</italic>). Estrogen, which plays a crucial role in endometrial carcinogenesis, is synthesized from testosterone; thus, perturbation of testosterone metabolic pathways is likely to affect endometrial cancer risk. It is expected decreased levels of the <italic>CYP3A7</italic> and <italic>CYP11B1</italic> transcripts would result in an increase of sex-hormone levels. Indeed, candidate causal variants at the 7q22.1 endometrial cancer risk signal associate with decreased expression of <italic>CYP3A7</italic>, increased total and bioavailable testosterone in women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, increased estradiol levels in men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, increased progesterone levels (in males and females combined)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and increased bone mineral density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, a trait highly influenced by estrogen levels. Analyses at 7q22.1 highlighted candidate causal variant rs45446698 as a likely functional variant whose risk allele may reduce <italic>CYP3A7</italic> expression by generation of motifs bound by three transcriptional repressors. Consistent with this effect, two repressors (MEIS1 and FOXP1) also inhibit testosterone signaling through effects on the androgen receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. At the 8q24.3 locus, candidate causal endometrial cancer risk variants associate with aberrant splicing of <italic>CYP11B1</italic>, increased total and bioavailable testosterone in women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and increased estrone levels in men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Interestingly, associations with testosterone levels at both loci are highly female-specific with no significant association observed amongst men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The remaining novel risk locus identified by our multi-trait BF GWAS analysis is located at 16q12.2, intronic to the <italic>FTO</italic> gene. Although not statistically significant in the independent replication set (P &#x003E; 0.05), the direction of effect appeared concordant. A highly pleiotropic locus, 16q12.2 was the first locus identified by GWAS of BMI and has subsequently been reported to associate with a large number of anthropometric and obesity-related traits, including waist and hip circumference, body fat percentage, visceral adipose levels, diabetes and metabolic syndrome (reviewed by Yang et al., 2017<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>). A recent GWAS reported that variants at this locus associate with breast cancer risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. This is the first study to identify 16q12.2 as a potential endometrial cancer risk locus using GWAS analysis. The endometrial cancer risk signal is the same as that reported for BMI, with the endometrial cancer risk variant associating with increased BMI, as expected. Although obesity-related variants are located within the <italic>FTO</italic> gene, a range of experiments, including CRISPR gene editing, mouse models and chromatin capture assays, linked <italic>IRX3</italic> and <italic>IRX5</italic> to this phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Interrogation of promoter-associated loops in endometrial cell lines found interactions between endometrial cancer risk variants and <italic>IRX3</italic> and <italic>IRX5</italic>. We additionally identified the promoters of <italic>AKTIP, CRNDE</italic> and <italic>LPCAT2</italic> as interacting with endometrial cancer risk variation through chromatin looping at this locus, but their role, if any, in endometrial carcinogenesis is unclear.</p>
<p>The findings from the Mendelian randomization and GWAS analyses suggest therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat endometrial cancer (e.g. weight loss or reduction of testosterone levels). Weight loss, in particular that induced by bariatric surgery, has been shown to reduce endometrial cancer risk by up to 80&#x0025; (reviewed by <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>). However, there have been limited studies of the effect of weight loss on endometrial cancer survival and the few studies to date have been small and inconclusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Although there are a number of medications available to reduce testosterone levels, through a variety of mechanisms (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>), there have also been very few studies that have intentionally targeted testosterone in endometrial cancer. Currently, it is not clear if testosterone exerts its effects on endometrial cancer susceptibility simply as a precursor to estrogen or through other pathways such as androgen receptor signaling. Intriguingly, an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks testosterone signaling (enzalutamide) has been reported to inhibit proliferation of primary endometrial tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> and is currently being studied in combination with chemotherapy in a phase II trial of endometrial cancer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: NCT02684227). Further studies are needed in this area to determine the molecular effects of testosterone on endometrial cancer development and its potential for therapeutic targeting.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates the strength of using the largest endometrial cancer GWAS dataset available and leveraging genetic information of risk factors to identify new susceptibility loci to endometrial cancer. The significance and directions of these new loci were also validated in an independent endometrial cancer GWAS dataset, though not all loci were confirmed. This indicates the necessity of a larger replication dataset to verify the findings in this study. All studies included in the discovery ECAC GWAS and the datasets included in the multi-trait bGWAS analysis were of European ancestry. Thus, we cannot say whether these variants are transferrable to other ethnic groups, a limitation of this study. The lack of availability of sex-stratified GWAS summary statistics for some traits may fail to detect some risk factors and consequently risk loci of endometrial cancer due to the existence of sex dimorphism for some traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. As the UK Biobank, FinnGen, and Japanese Biobank did not include histology information of endometrial cancer cases, we were unable to validate the identified risk loci associated with endometrioid endometrial cancer. We were also unable to assess non-endometrioid endometrial cancer in our study. Due to the small number of cases in this subset (n = 1,230)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, we could not quantify the heritability of non-endometrioid endometrial and therefore could not run genetic correlation analyses.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have used genetic approaches to comprehensively identify and assess risk factors for endometrial cancer. We were then able to leverage risk factor genetic information in a multi-trait GWAS analysis to identify novel endometrial cancer risk loci. We found the majority of risk factors for endometrial cancer are related to obesity and body composition. Multivariate Mendelian randomization analysis highlighted the importance of sex steroid hormones on endometrial cancer development, with three of the four independent risk factors identified related to sex hormone exposure (i.e. testosterone levels, SHBG levels and age at menarche). Indeed, two of the three novel loci identified by multi-trait GWAS analysis are strongly associated with testosterone levels in women. The findings of this study identify additional opportunities for hormone treatment and further support weight loss measures such as bariatric surgery to reduce the risk of developing endometrial cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>.</p>
