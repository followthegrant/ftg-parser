<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Accurate regulation of cutaneous immunity is fundamental for human health and quality of life but is severely compromised in inflammatory skin disease. To investigate the molecular crosstalk underpinning tolerance vs inflammation in human skin, we set up a human in vivo allergen challenge study, exposing patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) to house dust mite (HDM). Analyses of transcriptional programmes at the population and single cell levels in parallel with immunophenotyping of resident and infiltrating immune cells indicated that inflammatory responses to HDM were associated with immune activation in Langerhans cells (LCs) and cutaneous T cells. High basal level of TNF&#x03B1; production by cutaneous Th17 T cells predisposed to an inflammatory reaction and resulted in formation of hub structures where LCs and T cells interacted, leading to loss of functional programming in LCs. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms in MT1X gene associated with enhanced expression of metallothioneins and transcriptional programmes encoding antioxidant defences across skin cell types in non-reactive patients, were protective against T cell mediated inflammation. Our results provide a unique insight into the dynamics of immune regulation in the human skin and define regulatory circuits that can be harnessed to improve skin health and treat disease.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Body surfaces such as the skin, which form the interface with the environment, play a vital role in sensing whether environmental insults are &#x201C;dangers&#x201D; and communicate this to the adaptive immune system i<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Healthy skin is able to maintain immune homeostasis despite of constant environmental insults and an inhabiting biofilm of microbiota. However, in chronic inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis (AD), this immunotolerance is breached resulting in uncontrolled immune responses to otherwise innocuous allergens, resulting in flares and exacerbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>AD is one of the most prevalent inflammatory skin conditions, affecting up to 20&#x0025; of children and 4-7&#x0025; of adults in European countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. 20-30&#x0025; of AD cases are refractory to treatment, and hence very difficult to manage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Importantly, even though attributing definite causes for eczematous reactions is often impossible, environmental allergens such as pollens, dust mites, pet dander from cats and dogs, moulds and human dandruff, are the commonest triggers inducing allergic immune responses in eczema<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Such aberrant allergic responses are thought to be a result of a complex crosstalk between an environmental trigger, impaired skin barrier and Th2 adaptive immune activation, resulting in chronic, prolonged inflammation, and uncontrolled flares <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Interestingly, even though Th2, the key immunophenotype characterising the skin of patients with AD, is overexpressed in the lesional skin, it is also present in the clinically non-inflamed sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, putting in question its definitive role as a sole driver for flares and acute responses.</p>
<p>Advances applying next generation sequencing technologies at the single-cell level resolution progressed our understanding of the complexity of multicellular interactions driving skin disease pathology. Recent research indicates that the regulatory function is dispersed across multiple cell types, cooperating in homeostasis, including immune cells (dendritic cells, T lymphocytes) and parenchyma (keratinocytes, neurons) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. While several studies identify that intricate crosstalk between the parenchyma and immune cells is critical for skin homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, the exact nature of the crosstalk regulating induction of inflammation versus protecting the tolerance and immune homeostasis has not been elucidated.</p>
<p>We sought to delineate the specific interactions within the multicellular cutaneous network underpinning development of cutaneous T-cell mediated immune responses to allergen in skin of patients with AD. A long-standing clinical observation indicates that only a proportion of patients with detectable allergic responses on blood test have positive eczematous responses to local skin challenge with the same allergens. While patients with severe AD show a significantly higher frequency of IgE reactivity to allergens such as cat (Fel d 1) and house dust mite (HDM, Der p 1, 4 and 10) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, it is not understood what determines whether such skin reactivity is present, or why, in some patients with positive blood-derived T cell reactivity to allergens, a skin challenge fails to elicit an eczematous response.</p>
<p>To address this question, we set up a human <italic>in vivo</italic> challenge model exposing patients with AD to a common aeroallergen, house duct mite (HDM), and investigated transcriptional programmes and function of resident and infiltrating immune cells in reactive versus non-reactive patch test sites. This unique approach allowed us not only to delineate a network of interactions in human skin changing dynamically upon exposure to allergen but progressed our understanding of molecular mechanisms safeguarding cutaneous homeostasis. Our analysis indicates that responses to HDM are mediated by Th17 TNF-expressing T cells in reactive patients, driving rapid expansion and overactivation of Langerhans cells (LCs). Interestingly, protection against T cell-mediated inflammation is likely to be conferred by an elaborate network of interactions, including antioxidant responses in the parenchyma. This network contributes to cutaneous non-reactive state, preventing T cell activation and LC exhaustion. It is therefore likely, that therapeutic interventions aimed towards disrupting Th17/TNF&#x03B1; mediated immune cross talk, or directed towards enhancing antioxidant responses, can be harnessed to improve skin health and prevent exacerbations of atopic dermatitis.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> allergen challenge model to investigate mechanisms of local immune responses in human skin</title>
<p>To investigate the behaviour of systemic and cutaneous human immune systems upon exposure to an allergen, we set up a human <italic>in vivo</italic> allergen challenge study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We recruited 28 adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis under the care of a dermatologist in a tertiary referral center. Skin barrier integrity, systemic blood responses and responsiveness to allergen in skin prick test (SPT) were used to assess structural and systemic parameters. The study group comprised 15 males, 13 females, 89&#x0025; (25/28) of Caucasian ethnicity, with median age = 37 years, (IQR 24.25-53.50), (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). Eczema severity scores (EASI) indicated moderate to severe disease (median = 17.7, IQR:10.2 &#x2013; 30.9, max = 51.4, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). Skin barrier was measured as transepidermal water loss (TEWL) of non-eczemtaous sites and was impaired in the AD patients: median = 17.7 g/m<sup>2</sup>h, IQR:13.3 &#x2013; 30.7, max = 85.0 compared to healthy; median = 8.1 g/m<sup>2</sup>h, IQR = 5.9-10.8, p&#x003C;0.0001, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 1B</xref>). Systemic immune response to HDM was assessed using skin prick test (SPT). 27/28 (96&#x0025;) patients showed positive SPT reactions to a range of allergens, and the reaction to HDM was one of the strongest (median wheal area 19mm<sup>2</sup>, IQR: 13-26 mm<sup>2</sup>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). All patients had atopic dermatitis (diagnosed by dermatologist as per UK Working Party diagnostic criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>), and the majority suffered with hay fever (24/28, 86&#x0025;) and asthma (21/28, 75&#x0025;) (ISAAC questionnaire, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). Local T cell mediated responses to HDM were measured via <italic>in vivo</italic> allergen exposure patch test and assessed by the clinician. 48 hours post application of a patch test to buttock skin, 11 out of the 28 patients showed clear positive reactions to HDM, and hence, were denoted as &#x201C;HDM-reactive&#x201D;. In 12 patients, HDM did not induce a visible response, thus they were labelled as &#x201C;HDM-non-reactive&#x201D; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Four patients reacted to the control patch and were thus labelled as &#x201C;irritated control reactions&#x201D;, while 1 patient developed redness in the patch test site which was classified by the clinician as not related to the patch test. This patient was excluded from group analysis.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Reactivity to HDM is mediated by co-expansion of T cells and LCs</title>
<p>One of the possible explanations for the observed lack of responses to HDM in non-reactive patients with known T cell reactivity is a difference in the epidermal permeability barrier, providing better protection against antigen penetration in those patients. However, in our cohort of patients, the measured TEWL level indicated greater epidermal permeability in non-reactive patients (p=0.044, Mann-Whitney test, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) Interestingly, high TEWL seemed to predispose to irritated control responses, perhaps highlighting that severely impaired skin barrier facilitates irritant inflammatory reactions. Furthermore, PCR analysis of patient PBMCs showed that the prevalence of mutations in filaggrin (FLG) gene, including 2282del4, R501X, S3247X, R2447X (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), was comparable between HDM-reactive and non-reactive patients (p&#x003E;0.9, chi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> test). Subsequently, seven loss of function variants were identified in FLG from whole exome sequencing, validating and extending the PCR results. The additional three variants (Gly1109GlufsTer13, Ser2817AlafsTer75 and Gly323X) were of high quality, had an allele balance &#x003E;0.19, and did not indicate differences between HDM-reactive and non-reactive patients (p = 0.44, chi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> test, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). The integrity of transcriptional programming relation to the epidermal barrier from reactive and non-reactive patients was further confirmed using single cell transcriptomic data, indicating programmes encoding tight junctions, desquamation, keratinization, cornification, lipid metabolism and desmosomes were not compromised in the skin of reactive patients (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>, n=6 paired biopsies, Supplementary Table 3).</p>

</fig>
<p>In contrast to lack of differences in skin barrier function, the wheal areas of HDM-positive SPT were significantly greater in patients with HDM-reactive patch tests (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel, p = 0.022, t-test), in agreement with observations by others <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Interestingly, cutaneous CD3&#x002B; T cell infiltration at baseline was higher in those patients, possibly indicating a higher immune activation status in skin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, right panel, p = 0.046, t-test). We therefore sought to delineate the immune mechanisms underpinning and coordinating local cutaneous responses to an allergen.</p>
<p>Following HDM application, there was no significant expansion of T cells in non-reactive patch tests or in irritated control reactions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E,G</xref>), in comparison to the control patch tests. In contrast, in reactive patients, the higher frequency of T lymphocytes at the baseline translated into higher expansion post patch test (p=0.0001, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F,G</xref>). The proportion of HLADR&#x002B; cells was visibly higher in responding patients, therefore we sought to determine which population of local antigen presenting cells could be sustaining T cell activation. Quantification of the proportions of LCs (CD207&#x002B; CD1a&#x002B;) versus dermal DC (CD207-CD1a<sup>dim</sup>) in skin biopsies before and after patch testing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2HIJ</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>) confirmed that a relative expansion of LCs and dermal DCs in reactive, but not tolerant skin compared to baseline.</p>
<p>We observed, a strong correlation between the increase in fold change of LCs and T cells compared to baseline (r<sup>2</sup>=0.59, p&#x003C;0.0001, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>) suggesting that immune crosstalk between these cells perpetuates the responses to allergen. In comparison, correlation between dermal DC and T cells was much weaker (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>). In-situ co-localisation of LC (green) and T cells (red) was confirmed in patients reacting to HDM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>). Intriguingly, they created hubs akin to tertiary immune structures, inducible skin-associated lymphoid tissue (iSALT) previously described in a mouse model of contact dermatitis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. While these structures were less frequent in the control skin of reactive patients, T cells were localised in closer proximity to the epidermis, compared with that of non-reactive patients (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>HDM reactivity in reactive patients is mediated by LC : T cell TNF crosstalk and impairs LC transcriptional programming</title>
<p>The proximity of localisation and co-expansion of LCs and T cells in reactive patch tests suggests that immune crosstalk between these cells is important for T cell mediated cutaneous reaction to HDM. To investigate in depth transcriptional changes in LCs in non-reactive vs reactive patients, CD207&#x002B;CD1a&#x002B; LCs were purified from control and HDM-challenged patch test sites, by fluorescence activated cell sorting (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>), and RNA isolated for whole transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. Transcriptome profiles from LCs in control biopsies across patient groups were consistent with steady-state LCs described by us recently <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> with programmes encoding cell cycle, including oxidative phosphorylation (BH adj p &#x003C; 2&#x00D7;10E-8), antigen processing and presentation (BH adj p &#x003C; 2&#x00D7;10E-8), protein targeting to ER (BH adj p &#x003C; 2&#x00D7;10E-36) and protein catabolic process (BH adj p = 2&#x00D7;10E-25), (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Supplementary Table 4). Transcript-to-transcript correlation analysis of 28032 filtered and normalised transcripts (BioLayout r=0.85, MCL = 1.7, minimal cluster size = 10 genes) identified 10 clusters of 1115 co-expressed genes, clearly split into two distinct structures (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). Surprisingly, despite the significant expansion of LC numbers in the reactive HDM-patch test sites, our analyses uncovered impairment of LC transcriptional programming in those samples in comparison to both paired control patch test and to non-reactive patches. The majority of genes (691, Clusters 01,03,04,05,07,08,10) followed a characteristic pattern of expression, with significant downregulation after exposure to HDM in cells isolated from reactive patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>, Supplementary Table 5). This was reflected in downregulation of LCs core transcriptomic programmes, such as protein targeting to ER (BH adj p = 5.67E-82), ubiquitin proteinase ligase binding (BH adj p = 5.83E-10), and antigen processing and presentation (BH adj p =7.38E-9), described by us as key for LC function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Flow cytometric analyses of LCs across non-reactive and reactive patch-tests indicated that in non-reactive and irritant responses, exposure to HDM increased expression of CD207, the LC hallmark antigen uptake receptor. In contrast, levels of CD207 were markedly decreased in reactive patches, indicating reduction in LCs antigen acquisition and processing function, consistent with observed transcriptional changes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Unbiased weighted gene expression network analysis (WGCNA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>) investigating dependencies between bulk LC transcriptomes and clinical parameters (including TEWL measurements, SPT response, EASI scores), and skin immune parameters (CD3&#x002B; T cell infiltration, activation of Th subtypes in blood as measured by flow cytometry) identified 7 modules of co-expressed genes. This unbiased analysis confirmed strong correlation existed between changes of LCs transcriptome modules, disease severity as measured by EASI (module yellow, r=0.48, adj p = 0.001), and level of CD3&#x002B; T cell infiltrate in the skin (module turquoise, (&#x007C;r&#x007C;=0.31, adj p = 0.04, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>, Supplementary Table 6).</p>

<p>To identify the molecular interactions underpinning LC activation and apparent loss of functional transcriptome, we assessed transcriptional programmes and molecular cross talk in further 6 biopsies from 1 non-reactive and 2 reactive patients using single cell RNA-sequencing. Ligand-receptor analyses of single cell transcriptomes isolated from full skin biopsies confirmed that a signalling edge from activated T lymphocytes delivered activation stimulus via TNF: TNFRSF1B uniquely in HDM-reactive patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-G</xref>). This edge was present at baseline, and became dominant after exposure to HDM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).

<p>Interestingly, the same set of genes was differentially expressed at baseline between non-reactive and reactive patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, p&#x003C;0.0001), indicating that LCs in reactive patients were more highly activated before exposure to allergen, and pointing to TNF&#x03B1; as the driving stimulus (Supplementary Table 5).</p>

<p>Comparative analyses of the prevalence and activation of specific T cell clusters across patient groups showed that T cell changes in response to allergen were quantitative rather than qualitative (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), as cell numbers at baseline differed significantly between reactive and non-reactive patients (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Together with changes in T cell numbers observed by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), this strongly indicated that the inflammatory process in HDM patch test site is driven by T cell expansion from populations present at baseline. Interestingly, a trend was observed for HDM-induced expansion of Tregs in patients clinically non-responding to HDM (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Contrasting T cell populations in reactive and non-reactive patients indicated that in reactive patients higher activation status of T cells was seen across clusters, manifested by up-regulation of <italic>NFATC2, JUN</italic> and NFkB transcription factors (as exemplified by <italic>RELB</italic>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, T cells from non-reactive patients expressed transcription factors regulating tolerogenic properties (<italic>STAT5B</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistently, genes up-regulated in reactive patients encoded T cell activation via JAK-STAT and Wnt signalling pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, in patients non-reactive to HDM, T cells showed enrichment of processes of cellular senescence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>Unbiased clustering analysis revealed statistically significant overrepresentation of TNF expressing T cells within Tfh cluster (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,K</xref>, TWEAK signaling pathway enriched in CR vs CNR, adj p value 0.019) in unstimulated skin of patients reactive to HDM. Testing for specific T cell transcriptional programmes including Th1, Th2, Th17, Th22, and Treg (as defined by HCA), confirmed enrichment in Th17 cells, overrepresented across Tfh and CD4 na&#x00EF;ve clusters, co-localising with TNF-expressing T cells. These cells were highly activated at baseline, delineating a specific immunophenotype of CD3&#x002B;IL17&#x002B;TNF&#x002B;CD69&#x002B; T cells overrepresented at baseline in the skin of patients reactive to HDM.</p>
<p>In contrast, Th1, Th2 and Th22 immunophenotypes were shared between cells across patient groups and T cell populations, resembling continuous phenotype clouds of T cells in gut tissue, as described by Kiner an colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Interestingly, even though Th2 determinants were expressed more strongly in patients with reactive HDM-patch tests, Th2 polarisation, albeit weaker, was also evident in non-reactive patients, both at baseline and following <italic>in vivo</italic> challenge with the allergen (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4B,C</xref>), in agreement with earlier findings reporting Th2 responses in non-lesional eczema skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To test, whether the Th17 overexpression was translated into functional protein synthesis, we assayed cytokine expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from reactive and non-reactive patients. While no differences were discovered in IL13-producing CD4&#x002B; T cells between patient groups (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>), IL-17 producing T cells were significantly overrepresented in blood of reactive patients even prior to stimulation with HDM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). The importance of TNF for inter-cellular communication in the skin of reactive patients was next confirmed in crosstalk analyses, demonstrating a TNF: TNFSFRB signaling edge between T cells and APCs, already present at baseline, and strengthened on exposure to HDM in reactive patients.</p>

<p>Differential gene expression analyses performed for each specific cell population between sample phenotypes indicated that amongst all the cell populations the most DEGs differentiating reactive and non-reactive patients were expressed at baseline by differentiated KCs (825 DEGs, MAST, FDR&#x003C;0.05, Supplementary table 8). These encoded skin differentiation (FDR p=6&#x00D7;10E-13), hyperkeratosis (FDR p=4&#x00D7;10E-3) and skin inflammation (FDR p=3&#x00D7;10E-3 (ToppGene, Supplementary table 9). Testing for enrichment of pre-defined signatures confirmed that in reactive patients, there was enhanced inflammatory status of differentiated keratinocytes at baseline (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C,D</xref>), which was validated by unbiased single cell whole transcriptome analysis and could be localised to the spinous layer (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5 D,E</xref>). The activated immune status was epitomised by kinase activity (Supplementray table 9). Interestingly, one of the most highly overexpressed genes, <italic>MAP4K5</italic>, has been implicated in responses to environmental stress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though very few differentially expressed genes were found in other cell populations at baseline, analysis of molecular crosstalk indicated their importance in signalling to T lymphocytes. A signalling edge between FAM3C on mast cells to CLEC2D was associated with driving T cell maturation and activation to terminal differentiation, demonstrated by KLRB1 expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G,H</xref>). Importantly, activation via CLEC2D has been shown to drive TNF expression in multiple cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> providing a plausible explanation for TNF-expressing Tfh T lymphocytes observed at baseline in HDM-reactive patients.</p>
<p>While differences at baseline localised specifically to epidermis, in reactive patients exposure to HDM induced activation across many more skin cell types, including fibroblasts and venous endothelial cells, which corresponded to the inflamed, lesion status of the patch test (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>, Supplementary Table 10). Importantly, after the exposure to HDM, differentiated keratinocytes initiated HIF1 signalling pathway, providing further evidence that the cutaneous inflammation was associated with hypoxia and oxidative stress (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Enhanced expression of metallothionein genes protects non-reactive patients from HDM-induced T cell-mediated inflammation</title>
<p>Having identified that baseline epidermal sub-clinical inflammation, high activation status of the cutaneous immune compartment, and TNF signalling predisposed to positive inflammatory responses to HDM, we sought to evaluate the parameters protective against inflammation and conducive to local immunotolerance.

<p>Metallothioneins (MT) are small, cysteine-rich heavy metal-binding proteins which participate in an array of protective stress responses. Given the uniform downregulation across the skin cell types, we sought to test whether DNA polymorphisms could underpin differences in non-reactive vs reactive patients. Hypothesis driven GenePy logistic regression analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> of 34 genes encoding oxidative stress responses, and key immunological and structural features predefined in the study (Supplementary Table 11), identified <italic>MT1X</italic> as the top gene differentiating patient groups. A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the relation between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in <italic>MT1X</italic> and reactivity to HDM. The relation between these variables was close to significant, chi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> = 3.96, p = 0.076, indicating that existence of a SNP in <italic>MT1X</italic> protected from allergen-driven inflammation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Examining the genomic region of MT1X, we confirmed, that both SNPs (16:56682411:G&#x003E;T and 16:56682435:C&#x003E;A) were localized in the promoter and enhancer region of <italic>MT1X</italic> gene (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, even though alterations in <italic>MT1X</italic> promoter sequence appeared to underpin reactivity to HDM, all reactive patients degraded mRNA for all type 1 metallothioneins on exposure to the allergen. Functional human metallothionein genes are clustered on human chromosome 16, and they respond to environmental stresses in a coordinated manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. This posed a possibility of existence of additional inducible regulation of metallothionein expression. WGCNA analysis pointed to a specific module of genes (turquoise, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>, Supplementary Table 6), the expression of which varied with the level of CD3 infiltrate. Genes correlating positively with CD3 infiltrate encoded signalling receptor activity. In contrast, genes whose expression decreased with CD3&#x002B; T cell frequency encoded cellular homeostasis including response to metal ions and to cytokine stimulus (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6C</xref>, Supplementary Table 12), comprising several members of metallothionein family (<italic>MT2A, MT1G, MT1X)</italic>. Strikingly, LCs from samples where CD3 T cells expanded on exposure to HDM (red) were separated by reduced expression of genes in the turquoise module, including metallothioneins <italic>MT2A, MT1G, MT1X</italic>, ferritin chains (<italic>FLT, FTH1</italic>) and heme oxygenase (<italic>HMOX1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), creating a network of antioxidant defences (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). We next confirmed the expression of metallothionein genes was decreased in chronic AD lesions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>) and compromised across a range of T-cell mediated skin diseases, in comparison to healthy skin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of publicly available data of keratinocytes exposed to a range of cytokines, indicate, that expression of metallothioneins can be downregulated by IL17a and TNF&#x03B1; (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>), providing an inducible mechanism by which T cell mediated allergic immune responses deplete the RedOx buffer, and render the skin susceptible to chronic inflammation.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Accurate regulation of cutaneous immunity is fundamental for human health and quality of life as inappropriate immune activation results in inflammatory disorders, affecting up to 40&#x0025; of the population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In AD this problem is particularly severe, manifested by frequent exacerbations and resulting in significant morbidity in paediatric and adult patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Comparing cutaneous and systemic responses of eczema patients to HDM, we demonstrated that despite evident allergen-specific responses in blood, nearly 50&#x0025; of patients did not react clinically to an epicutaneous patch test with allergen. We ruled out the possibility that the lack of reactivity might be due to the epidermal permeability barrier preventing penetration of the allergen, as these individuals had a less effective barrier as indicated by increased TEWL. This suggested the existence of local epidermal tolerance in the non-lesional skin and posed a question about the factors regulating the distinctly different outcomes between reactive and non-reactive patients. To explore the molecular and cellular networks underpinning immune reactiveness, we took biopsies from control and HDM-exposed sites, and subjected isolated cell populations to micro-bulk and single cell transcriptomic analysis. These were validated with protein expression measured by flow cytometry and <italic>in situ</italic>. We further investigated exome sequence in a subset of genes preselected based on the transcriptomic analysis, to delineate potential single nucleotide polymorphisms which might be conferring protection from allergen-driven skin inflammation. This methodological approach allowed us to contrast immunoreactivity versus tolerance as it is happening in human skin <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Our study documents that immunotolerance is the baseline state of cutaneous immune network in AD, similar to healthy skin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, and is mediated by numerous interactions across multiple parenchymal and immune cell subsets. In allergen-responsive individuals, this innate state of tolerance is overcome by inflammatory signalling, epitomised in crosstalk between activated Tfh Th17 TNF-expressing T cells and LCs. Importantly, the baseline state in skin is distinctively different in non-reactive and reactive patients. These baseline differences are localised mainly to the epidermis and the immune compartment. In contrast, following allergen application, when the inflammatory reaction has developed and has formed a skin lesion, activation of other cell types becomes evident, similar to changes observed between non-lesional and lesion skin of AD patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our analyses indicate that while sub-clinical inflammation in keratinocytes seems to pre-set the epidermal microenvironment, specific signals from mast cells and fibroblasts, including FAM3C on mast cells to CLEC2D on T cells drive TNF expression. The expansion of LC in response to HDM is intriguing; while expansion of dermal DC can be attributed to infiltration of monocytic precursors from blood, the epidermal compartment is independent of blood progenitors. Thus, the expansion would need to be due to local rapid proliferation, differentiation from skin resident precursors or local chemotaxis from epidermis surrounding the patch test site, in response to signals induced in the inflammatory patch test reaction. A similar observation was made recently when contrasting lesional and non-lesional AD skin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, indicating that allergic reactivity induced by HDM mimics biological changes in chronic lesions, and suggesting LC expansion is an early event in lesion formation. Furthermore, changes we observed in expression of CD207, a key molecule for pathogen sequestration in skin, may point to a mechanism compromising anti-microbial defences in AD skin, and thus perpetuating inflammation.</p>
<p>The frequency and the state of activation of Tfh Th17 TNF-expressing T cells appears to be critical for subsequent reaction to the allergen. Tfh have been previously implicated in driving re-call allergic responses to HDM in lungs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. However, our study defines these cells as Th17 TNF-expressing, in contrast to Th2 cells reported by others. Th17 T cells have been already shown to be of importance in AD, expressed at higher levels in skin of children than in adults <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and higher in intrinsic AD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Our previous analysis of skin immunophenotypes indicated existence of a specific endotype of Th17 high patients with AD, highly prevalent in chronic lesions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The role of Th17 skin infiltrating T cells in driving acute responses to an allergen could be conceivably executed via contributing to an augmented state of immune readiness, promoting more severe immune reaction. While IL17 has been established as driving innate anti-microbial responses, TNF&#x03B1; is a particularly multifunctional cytokine, exerting effect on numerous skin populations. TNF&#x03B1; drives expression of adhesion molecules in skin of patients with AD, which may facilitate immune cell extravasation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Together with Th2 cytokines TNF&#x03B1; induces atopic dermatitis-like features on epidermal differentiation proteins and stratum corneum lipids in human skin equivalents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Induced by S.aureus, TNF&#x03B1; leads to up-regulation of HLA-DR molecules in keratinocytes and facilitates HDM allergen presentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Inflammatory IL-17 and TNF&#x03B1; secreting CD4(&#x002B;) T cells have been shown to persist even in highly immunosuppressive cancer environments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, indicating their potential to overcome mechanisms of cutaneous homeostasis.</p>
<p>TNF&#x03B1; secreted by T cells could play a double role in driving LC function by regulating both LC migration and maturation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Expressed in unperturbed skin, it can drive LC activation. On exposure to HDM, TNF produced by activated T cells will provide a chemotactic signal for LC to migrate out of the epidermis. In the hub structures observed in HDM reactive patients, activated LCs would support T cell activation and survival, perpetuating inflammation. However, in addition to delivering chemotactic and pro-maturation signals, TNF&#x03B1; has cytotoxic functions, likely resulting in the observed expansion and loss of functional transcriptomes of LCs. Several lines of evidence point to the importance of the ability of Langerhans cells (LCs) to induce immunotolerance as critical for cutaneous homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. In this context, loss of LC function could likely lead to uncontrolled inflammation <italic>in situ</italic>, as observed in the HDM reactive patch test. Such exhaustion induced by overactivation has previously been observed in dendritic cells and macrophages in chronic infection and when overwhelmed by antigen load <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to sub-clinical inflammation in the skin of reactive patients, expression of metallothioneins was associated with protection from HDM-driven inflammatory reaction. Levels of expression of metallothioneins seemed to be controlled both at the constitutive (via SNP in <italic>MT1X</italic> gene) and inducible levels (regulated by the acute oxidative stress/inflammation), highlighting the importance of anti-oxidative defences in AD skin. Importantly, anti-oxidative defence was one of the transcriptomic modules critically compromised in LCs from reactive patch test sites. Oxidative stress is one of the key components driving allergic sensitisation, and in asthma models, aeroallergens such as HDM, directly induce production of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage and dampen antioxidant responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Additionally, we and others demonstrate that cytokine signalling can affect metallothionein expression in an inducible manner. Indeed, increased oxidative stress during AD exacerbation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> and decreased antioxidant capability in children with eczema<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> has been previously observed. Since oxidative stress itself exhausts antioxidant responses and can be induced by many eczema-associated factors including allergens, hormones and chemicals, it is possible that chronic exposure to such triggers may compromise LC function in the epidermis of individuals with eczema making them less able to maintain cutaneous tolerance and extending our observation beyond the patch test system.</p>
<p>Based on our analyses, we propose a model in which sub-clinical inflammation exhausts metallothionein stores in the skin of genetically pre-disposed patients. This leads to the poised state of keratinocytes, expressing high levels of <italic>MAP4K5</italic> and other kinases. The sub-cutaneous inflammation is in parallel manifested by infiltration TNF&#x03B1; expressing activated T cells, and activated antigen presenting cells, including LCs. In response to allergen, these quickly initiate inflammatory responses and expand T cell population driving inflammatory reaction. This in turn leads to exhaustion of LCs, uncontrolled inflammation and lesion formation thereby mediating clinical signs of inflammation. In healthy/non inflamed skin allergen exposure, in the absence of subclinical inflammation, mediates immunological non-responsiveness, but in the inflamed skin depleted of oxidative defences, exposure to HDM initiates allergic inflammation.</p>
<p>Our current study provides a detailed description of cellular and molecular crosstalk in the skin of eczema patients, proposing a mechanism supporting development of allergen-induced inflammation. We conclude, that while immunotolerance conferred by LCs in healthy skin is preserved in non-lesional skin of eczema patients, this tolerance is compromised on activation of allergen-specific T lymphocytes infiltrating skin. lymphocytes infiltrating skin. Therefore, therapeutic strategies aiming to restore the healthier, tolerance-related signaling in the cutaneous immune network could help in preventing eczema exacerbations, harnessed to improving skin health and in relation to treating active skin disease lesions in patients with AD.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>Informed, written consent was obtained as per approval South East Coast -Brighton &#x0026; Sussex Research Ethics Committee in adherence to Helsinki Guidelines (approval: 16/LO/0999). Adult AD patients with mild to severe disease (mean objective EASI) were recruited through the Dermatology Centre, Southampton. University Hospital NHS Trust. All AD patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for AD as defined by the UK. AD diagnostic criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> allergen challenge model</title>
<p>House Dust Mite allergen (ALK-Abello, Horsholm, Denmark AD01-AD10, Citeq Biologics, Netherlands AD11-AD28) has been applied in paraffin via epicutaneous patch application to the upper buttock skin at a non-lesional site (free from eczema) following 10x tape strip procedure to remove stratum corneum, according to our previous method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. A control patch was applied in parallel following identical procedure, except for the HDM allergen. In all AD volunteers, this site showed no evidence of active eczema, and the volunteers were not being treated with topical therapy. Clinical responses were quantified 48 hours later at each challenge site by a specialist registrar in dermatology trained in patch testing. 6 mm skin biopsies were taken under local anaesthesia from allergen-exposed and control skin.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>Objective EASI was measured as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Before sampling, patients were washed out from any immunosuppressive treatment for at least 5 half-lives of the drug. Atopy status was assessed for each patient using Skin Prick Test (SPT) to six most common allergens: house dust mite, grass pollen, tree pollen mix, mixed mould, cat and dog plus histamine as a positive control (ALK-Abello, Horsholm, Denmark). Maintenance of normal epidermal barrier function was measured by trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). On enrolment, information about participants&#x2019; demographics and previous medical history, immediate family history and information about atopic disease (eg eczema, rhinitis) in the subject was collected based on the ISAAC questionnaire <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated from venous blood and processed for DNA extraction. FLG mutation analysis was performed as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Briefly, primer pairs were used to amplify the region of interest from DNA prepared from peripheral blood samples of individuals with atopic dermatitis and controls. FLG variants R501X, 2282del4, S3247X and R2447X, which covers more than 90&#x0025; of FLG mutations in a UK population, were then identified using restriction enzyme digest of PCR products with agarose gel electrophoresis and FLG variants were confirmed by whole exome sequencing.</p>

<title>Cell isolation</title>
<p>6 mm biopsies were minced using a surgical scalpel and digested for 16h at 37C with agitation in RPMI with LiberaseTM (Roche) following manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. After 16h of digestion cells were collected and washed with RPMI 5&#x0025; FBS. Cells were resuspended in PBS 1&#x0025; BSA 20mM EDTA and filtered through 70um sterile filters before surface antibody staining for FACS or processing for Dropseq analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9c3">
<title>Flow cytometry and cell sorting</title>
<p>All antibodies were used at pre-titrated, optimal concentrations. For surface staining of live cells buffer containing PBS 1&#x0025; BSA was used for all antibody staining. FACS Aria flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA) was used for analysis of human LCs for the expression of CD207, CD1a, HLA-DR (mouse monoclonal antibodies, CD1a, CD207:Miltenyi Biotech, UK and HLA-DR: BD Biosciences, UK) or T cells for the expression of CD3, CD25 and CD103 (Miltenyi Biotech). Freshly isolated PBMCs were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (1 mg/&#x03BC;1), with GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). The Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) was used according to the manufacturers&#x2019; instructions.</p>
<p>Flow cytometric analysis with the FACS Aria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) was undertaken following lymphocyte gating on Forward/Side scatter. Subsequent gating on CD3-PerCP 5.5 (eBiosciences), CD4-VioGreen (Miltenyi Biotech) was based on appropriate negative controls to demonstrate IL13-APC and IL-17-FITC positive cells (Miltenyi Biotech) for analysis with the FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland).</p>
<p>Singlets (FCSA:FCSH), CD207&#x002B;/CD1a&#x002B; digested LCs were sorted into trizol for RNA isolation. In parallel, LC-depleted skin cells were sorted into RPMI 5&#x0025; FBS and processed for immediate cryostorage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9c4">
<title>Immunofluorescence microscopy of frozen tissue sections</title>
<p>Snap frozen skin samples were embedded in OCT (CellPath) and cut to 5-10 &#x00B5;m cryosections onto APES-coated slides. Sections were fixed in 4&#x0025; paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, blocked with PBS &#x002B; 1&#x0025; BSA &#x002B; 10&#x0025; FBS and incubated for 30 minutes with primary antibodies to the following markers: Langerin (Leica), multi-cytokeratin (Leica), CD3 (Dako), CD4 (Abcam), CD8 (Abcam) or FOXP3 (Abcam). After washing off the primary antibodies, secondary antibodies were added; these included: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG1a, Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse IgG2b (all from ThermoFisher Scientific). Sections were then counterstained with DAPI (Sigma), mounted with Mowiol (Harco), coverslipped and imaged using an Olympus Dotslide scanning fluorescence microscope and Olympus VS-Desktop software.</p>

<title>RNA-seq</title>
<p>RNA was isolated using Direct-zol RNA micro prep (Zymo, UK) as per the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. RNA concentration and integrity was determined with an Agilent Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA. Preparation of RNA-seq libraries and sequencing were carried out by Source Bioscience, UK. cDNA libraries were generated using SMART-Seq Stranded Library Preparation for Ultra Low Input according to the SMART-Seq Stranded Kit User Manual following the Ultra low input workflow (Takara Bio). Samples were pooled (12/batch) for library preparation. Amplified libraries were validated on the Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 to check the size distribution and on the Qubit High Sensitivity to check the concentration of the libraries. All the libraries passed the QC step. Sequencing was done on Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument, 75bp PE runs, 20 &#x00D7;10<sup>6</sup> reads per sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9c6">
<title>Drop-seq</title>
<p>Freshly dissociated whole skin biopsies were suspended in RNAse-out buffer and processed on ice to the co-encapsulation of single cells with genetically-encoded beads (Drop-seq, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>). Monodisperse droplets at 1 nl in size were generated using the microfluidic devices fabricated in the Centre for Hybrid Biodevices, University of Southampton. To achieve single cell/single bead encapsulation with barcoded Bead SeqB (Chemgenes, USA), microfluidics parameters (pump flow speeds for cells and bead inlets, cell buoyancy) were adjusted to optimise cell-bead encapsulation and the generation of high quality cDNA libraries. Based on encapsulation frequencies and bead counts up to 2000 STAMPS /sample were taken further for library prep (High Sensitivity DNA Assay, Agilent Bioanalyser, 12 peaks with the average fragment size 500 bp). The resulting libraries were run on a shared NextSeq run (4&#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> reads/cell for maximal coverage) at the Wessex Investigational Sciences Hub laboratory, University of Southampton, to obtain single cell sequencing data</p>

<sec id="s9c7">
<title>Constellation-seq</title>
<p>Single cell libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell 3&#x2019; library and gel bead kit v3.1 from 10x Genomics. Briefly, cell suspensions were tagged using TotalSeq&#x2122; hashtag antibodies (Biolegend). After pooling, 10,000 viable cells were loaded onto a channel of the 10x chip to produce Gel Bead-in-Emulsions (GEMs). This underwent reverse transcription to barcode RNA before clean-up and cDNA amplification. cDNA was used for targeted linear amplification comprising 20 rounds of linear amplification (60&#x00B0;C) using a pool of primers (Supplementary Table 7) at 40 nM and 0.4 &#x00B5;M of a P5 3&#x2019;blocked primer as described previously(Vallejo et al). cDNA libraries were purified twice using AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) magnetic beads (1:0.6) and libraries assessed using a Bioanalyser before tagmentation and Next-seq sequencing on an Illumina Nextseq500, (paired end 28&#x00D7;60 bp reads).</p>

<title>Bulk RNA-seq data analysis</title>
<p>Quality control for FASTQ files with raw sequence data was done using FASTQC tool [FastQC: a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data. Available online at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc</ext-link>]. High-quality reads filtered at 15M depth across all samples were mapped to the human genome (GRCh38) using Kallisto<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Raw counts from RNA-Seq were processed in Bioconductor package EdgeR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> and SLEUTH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, variance was estimated and size factor normalized using trimmed mean of M-values (TMM). Genes with minimum 2 reads at minimum 50&#x0025; samples were included in the downstream analyses. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) we identified applying significance threshold FDR p&#x003C;0.05, &#x007C;LogFC&#x007C;&#x003E;1. Normalised reads were taken for transcript-to-transcript co-expression analysis (BioLayout <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>). Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.85, Markov Clustering Algorithm = 1.7.. WGCNA analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>were run on 5000 genes with maximum median absolute deviation (MAD), at power=4 module size 30 in R v 4.0.3 using voom transformed (TMM) normalised expression data.

<title>Whole exome data analysis</title>
<p>The raw fastq files were aligned to the human genome reference GRCh38 with additional HLA regions included. Alignment was performed using BWA-MEM v0.7.15-r1140 and Samtools <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> v1.3.1. Picard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>) was used to mark duplicates, sort the BAM files, index, and fix the mate pairs. GATK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> v4 base quality score recalibration (BQSR) was used to detect systematic errors by the sequencing machine when it estimates the accuracy of each base call. Joint-calling was executed using a bespoke script. GATK GenomicsDBImport was used to create a database of all g.vcf files for joint-calling and was targeted to the intersection between Agilent SureSelect V6 and Agilent SureSelect V5, both with &#x002B;/-150bp padding. GATK Genotype GVCF was applied to joint-call the 28 AD samples with 1100 inflammatory bowel disease patients. A final script applied GATK Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR), a technique applied on the variant callset that uses machine learning to model the technical profile of variants in a training set and uses that to flag probable artefacts from the callset. Annotation was completed using Ensembl VEP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> v103. The joint-called vcf was uploaded to a local installation of seqr (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/seqr">https://github.com/broadinstitute/seqr</ext-link>) on a virtual machine for data visualisation, analysis, filtering and reporting. A suite of bespoke scripts was used to assess quality control. Bedtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> v2.26.0 was applied to calculate exome data coverage relative to the target capture kit. GATK VariantEval tool was used to calculate various quality control metrics including: the number of raw or filtered SNPs and the ratio of transitions to transversions. These metrics are further stratified by functional class, CpG site, and amino acid degeneracy. Picard CollectVariantCallingMetrics was applied to collect the per-sample and aggregate (spanning all samples) metrics from the provided vcf file. Peddy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/brentp/peddy">https://github.com/brentp/peddy</ext-link>) was executed locally in a python conda environment to assess the relatedness of individuals, and predict their ancestry and sex.
