<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We systematically investigated the transcriptomes of the peripheral immune cells from 6 inactivated vaccine, BBIBP-CorV recipients at 4 pivotal time points using single-cell RNA-seq technique. First, the significant variation of the canonical immune-responsive signals of both humoral and cellular immunity, as well as other possible symptom-driver signals were evaluated in the specific cell types. Second, we described and compared the common and distinct variation trends across COVID-19 vaccination, disease progression, and flu vaccination to achieve in-depth understandings of the manifestation of immune response in peripheral blood under different stimuli. Third, the expanded T cell and B cell clones were correlated to the specific phenotypes which allowed us to characterize the antigen-specific ones much easier in the future. At last, other than the coagulopathy, the immunogenicity of megakaryocytes in vaccination were highlighted in this study. In brief, our study provided a rich data resource and the related methodology to explore the details of the classical immunity scenarios.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As of May 2021, World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 148 million Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections and 3.1 million deaths worldwide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link>). Promotion and popularization of vaccine is vital to disease control, with its safety and efficacy of the top priority. There are multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines available and several vaccines under development, including the inactivated, genetically engineered subunit, adenovirus and nucleic acid vaccine types. So far, a number of institutions of different countries and regions have reported the results of safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on phase III clinical trials or phase III interim analysis, such as, vaccines BNT162b2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and mRNA-1273<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, adenovirus vaccines AZD1222<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, Ad5-nCoV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and inactivated vaccines BBIBP-CorV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and CoronaVac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and protein subunit vaccine NVX-2373<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. For example, Ugur Sahin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> demonstrated that RNA vaccine (BNT162b2) not only elicited adaptive humoral, but also stimulated the cellular immune response even at the low-dose vaccine. The new vaccine types such as adenovirus-vectored vaccines and RNA vaccines have emerged and fast developed with good efficacy in recent years, though severalserious adverse events have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Their efficacy and long-term safety were yet to be reviewed by a follow-up study. With the support of long clinical practice, traditional inactivated vaccines play an irreplaceable role in the prevention and control of infectious disease. As a pattern of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, BBIBP-CorV, was manufactured by Sinopharm China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and contained a SARS-CoV-2 strain inactivated inside Vero Cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, which was confirmed for its safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in clinical trials of healthy people in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and Jordan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cdn.who.int/">https://cdn.who.int/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technique has demonstrated its power in the research of cell biology by deconvoluting the transcriptional signals in the multi-cellular samples of heterogenous cellular compositions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Other than characterizing the cell types in a heterogeneous tissue, it enables us to detect the variabilities within a cell lineage. The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has prompted the demand of single-cell studies in order to uncover the characteristics immune responses of different immune cell types during the symptom development of COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. These published scRNA-seq datasets provide abundant and detailed reference information of this disease, though, no results have been reported for any COVID-19 vaccines yet. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison of the human immune responsive signals across the transcriptome at single-cell resolution over the time becomes practical and necessary. With no doubt, such detailed comparison facilitates the in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis, symptom development and immunization of COVID-19 which guides us to the better vaccination strategy. Therefore, we aimed to look through a &#x2018;sight glass&#x2019; of the human immunity system, a.k.a., peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to monitor the manifestation of vaccine response of the canonical immune cells. In the meantime, we could take the advantage of the recent published scRNA-seq datasets of COVID-19 patient samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and Flu vaccination samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> to achieve such a goal. Besides, the roles of megakaryocytes/platelets in COVID-19 recently have attracted some attentions due to recent reports of blood-clot side effect by AZD1222<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Megakaryocytes were also found to contribute to the complication of COVID-19 patients and be correlated to the organ failure and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We were therefore also interested in looking into the signals related to immune-responsive and coagulopathy in this non-canonical immune cell type using the scRNA-seq dataset.</p>
<p>In this study, we extensively investigated the PBMC samples of BBIBP-CorV vaccine recipients. Our scRNA-seq data delineated a high-resolution transcriptomic landscape of peripheral immune cells during the vaccination of a classical vaccine type. Meanwhile, we integrated the PBMC scRNA-seq datasets of COVID-19 patients and flu vaccination in order to identify the common and distinct variation trends among our data set and the two other data sets. All these efforts could provide a rich data resource and demonstrate a methodology to explore the human immunity in disease development and vaccination at great details. Moreover, this work could facilitate the in-depth understandings of the manifestation of immune response in peripheral blood under different stimuli and provide many clues to design the new assay for the assessment of the immune protection and adverse effects after the vaccination or infection recovery.</p>

<title>Overview of immune responses and peripheral immune cells variations by scRNA-seq</title>
<p>To assess the immune cells content and the phenotypic alterations following the vaccination with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV), six healthy young adults with 4 males and 2 females from Pu Dong Cohort, China, were enrolled in this 2019-nCoV vaccine observational study [NCT04871932] according to inclusion and exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1A</xref>). All six volunteers received 2 doses of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV). Blood samples were collected at 4 time points including the day before vaccination (BV), 7 days after first dose (1V7), 7 days after second dose (2V7) and 14 days after second dose (2V14) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Then, serum and PBMCs were separated from all time points of samples within 2-hour of collection. The 2019-nCoV Spike RBD antibodies and cytokines were measured in serum. After isolating the PBMCs, we profiled V(D)J repertoires of T and B cells integrated with 5&#x2019; Gene Expression using droplet based single-cell sequencing method (10&#x00D7; Genomics) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Based on the integrated single-cell gene expression profiles, we recovered the transcriptomes of &#x223C;120k high-quality cells in total from 24 samples and the total cells were combined and projected in a 2-D space using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Unsupervised clustering analyses and marker mapping enabled us to uncover 11 major types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1B</xref>). The markers for the 11 major immune cell lineages were shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1C</xref>. As the shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1D</xref>, summary statistics of the 11 cell-type fractions showed plasma cells increase significantly after the second dose, whereas the other 10 cell types pretty much remained the same level.</p>
<p>Previously, Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, Xia <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> have already demonstrated the satisfactory efficacy by increasing seroprotective antibody titers in the animal experiments and human clinical trials by this vaccine type. To further validate the efficacy in our participants, we measured 2019-nCoV Spike RBD antibodies using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Anti-S-RBD-specific IgG antibody level significantly increased after the second dose for total 6 participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1E</xref>). The growth of plasma cells content and the observable production neutralizing antibody by second dose suggests the robust humoral immune response. The cellular immunity was also assessed. 10-cytokine serum assays were first performed on the total 24 samples on bead-based flow-cytometric assays on the BD LSRFortessa X-20 platform, though, no obvious post-vaccination increase was observed (Fig.S1A). We then used an ultra-sensitive bead-array-based immunoassay (single-molecule array technique) to validate the IL-4 signal and found that the quantification was consistently lower (one order of magnitude) than the readings of BD LSRFortessa X-20 platform (Fig.S1B), which suggested, 1. most of the cytokines remained low level at these time points. 2. limit of quantification of bead-based flow-cytometric assays likely above the real concentrations of these cytokines in these samples (Fig. S1B).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Classical immune responsive signals of major immune cell types in vaccination</title>
<p>After the successful characterization of the major cell types, we were interested in investigating the gene expression patterns in the major immune cell types. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were first identified in 11 cell types by the comparisons between the post-vaccination samples vs. the pre-vaccination samples (BV). The DEGs list was shown in Supplementary table 1. The unsupervised clustering of these DEGs exhibited a pattern of 3 dominant clusters for the 24 samples in most of the cell types. We used the heatmap of B cells as an example to demonstrate the sample clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2A</xref>). The red cluster included the samples mostly in the 2V7 or 2V14 time points, which reflected an active immune responsive state (R-state). The green cluster included the samples mostly in early BV or 1V7 time points, which likely reflected the baseline or minor-responsive state (B-state). The blue cluster covered broader time points, which likely reflected a post-vaccination protection state (P-state) or recovery state. The identical clustering patterns were observed when the regulons heatmap were calculated and plotted using SCENIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2B</xref>). Such unsupervised clustering provided an unbiased sample grouping. More details of the signal variabilities by heatmaps for the major 6 cell types were shown in Fig.S2A-2J.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="21256781v1_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The DEGs were re-calculated based on the updated sample clusters (B-R-P) and the following 15 variable signaling keywords were identified based on these DEGs. The updated DEGs list for this comparison was shown in Supplementary table 2 and showed very little change. The coordinated gene expressions of a certain functional group or signaling pathway suggested their involvement in the response to BBIBP-Corv vaccination. We used simple schematic diagrams to illustrate the 5 dominant patterns of signal variation observed in the heatmaps to delineate the variability of immune-responsive signals in B-R-P state as Fig.S2K.</p>
<p>As expected, we observed the elevation of the monocytes&#x2019; type I interferon production signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2C</xref>, pattern 2), which was an essential signal of innate immunity for viral suppression. We also observed significant elevation of the antigen-specific follicular T helper cell (Tfh) activation (<italic>CD40LG, ICOS, SLAMF1</italic>, etc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2D</xref>, pattern 2) and the B cell activation signal (<italic>TLR7, CD80/CD86, BCL6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2E</xref>, pattern 2), that were associated with neutralizing antibody production. In the meantime, we evaluated the expression of different classes of constant gene of Immunoglobulin heavy chain. The IGHG went up and IGHM went down in protection state (P-state), suggesting the occurrence of class switching of neutralizing antibody molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2F</xref>).</p>
<p>TCR responsive signals (<italic>VAV3, AKT3, MALT1, MAPK1</italic>, etc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2G</xref>, pattern 1), as well as cytotoxic signal were also enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2H</xref>, pattern 3). These lymphocyte-related signals contributed to antigen-specific immunity, a.k.a., adaptive immunity.</p>
<p>The immune regulatory signals such as TGF-&#x03B2; pathway (<italic>TGFB1, TGFBR1/2, SMAD2/3/4</italic>, etc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2J</xref> pattern 5), and T cell exhaustion (<italic>LAG3, PDCD1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2I</xref> pattern 4) were suppressed in the high immune-responsive samples (R-state) until they went up to play their roles in the protection state (P-state).</p>
<p>We also identified some changes contradictory to the expectation. For example, NF-&#x03BA;B signal was expected to be upregulated in the most of the immunity situation (Fig.S2L). However, NF-&#x03BA;B signal actually went down (pattern 4). Second, instead of enhancing the antigen presenting, MHC I signal significantly dropped in most of the peripheral immune cell types in R group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2L</xref>, pattern 4). Though, type II MHC genes mostly went up as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.2K</xref>, pattern 2). Later, when we examined COVID-19 dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, we didn&#x2019;t observe such changes in COVID-19 patients. Why this change occurs and what outcomes will this change brings are elusive.</p>
<p>Other variabilities of the classical immune-responsive signals including cell-cycles and apoptosis (Fig.S2M-2N) were summarized in Supplementary table 3. High cell-cycle signal (<italic>ORC2, CCNH, CDC7, CDK7</italic>, etc.) and low apoptosis signal (<italic>BAX, BAD, TP53</italic>, etc.) indicated the high proliferative potential of the cells in R-state samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Characteristic transcriptions of the top TCR and BCR clones</title>
<p>As our scRNA-seq study also included TCR and BCR V(D)J sequencing results, it allowed us to track down the TCR/ BCR clonal expansion in these samples. The results showed the diversities of the T cell and B cell clones wend down after vaccination due to the expansion of the antigen-specific clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.3A, 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3G</xref>).

<p>First of all, it was found that top BCR clones were enriched in the samples after second dose, indicating the observable clone expansion occurred after the second dose. Second, it was found that the top 20 clones were highly correlated to low MHC II signal and high B cell activation signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>).

<p>Top TCR clones didn&#x2019;t necessarily occur in the post-vaccination time, which made it less straightforward to confirm their vaccine-specificity.

<title>Non-trivial roles of megakaryocytes in vaccine immunity</title>
<p>Megakaryocytes were mostly recognized for its role in the hemostasis and wound healing. Little has been discussed for its contribution in the disease or vaccine immunity. After examining this atypical immune cell type, we observed the gene expression variation of megakaryocytes in vaccine immunity.</p>
<p>First, the variation of platelet aggregation signal (<italic>GP9, ITGB3, TBXA2R, FLNA, VASP</italic>, etc.) in megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>, pattern 4) were identified. These genes were significantly down-regulated in the immune-responsive samples (R-state), which suggested low risk of thrombosis during the period of BBIBP-CorV vaccination. Later, when we inspected the same set of genes in the COVID-19 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and influenza vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> samples at the corresponding immune-responsive time point, instead of getting down-regulated, we found the platelet aggregation signal significantly went up (dashed red box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.4E</xref> and Fig.S3D). That means, the variation of platelet aggregation signal could be distinct by different vaccines.</p>
<p>As a myeloid-lineage cell type, it was found that megakaryocytes actually contributed more inflammatory signal than we thought, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&#x03B2;) production (<italic>TLR4, IFI16, CASP1, CASP8, NLRP1, NLRP2</italic>, etc.) and neutrophil activation (<italic>SA0018, S100A12, FCER1G, VNN1</italic>, etc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.4A, 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). The expression levels of the related genes were actually as high as the monocyte population (Fig. S2O and S2P), which was considered the dominant cell type of innate immunity in PBMCs. In flu vaccination, we observed the elevation of IL-1&#x03B2; production and neutrophil activation signal as well at 28-day sample, the putative high response time point (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4G</xref>). All these results suggested the roles of megakaryocytes in pathogenesis and vaccination should not be overlooked.</p>

<title>Transcriptomic similarity and distinction of COVID-19 and vaccination immunity in PBMC</title>
<p>It was postulated that the dysregulated immune response could be reflected in differential signals between the COVID-19 infection patients and the vaccine recipients. We were particularly interested in looking for the signatures that were associated to the symptom development and the later immune protection. By examining the similarity and the distinction of the developmental trend of these signals, we aimed to gain more insights of both disease development and vaccine protection.</p>
<p>We used the keywords in Supplementary table 3 to assess the COVID-19 samples. There were three natural sample groups in previous COVID-19 study, i.e., healthy control, progression samples of mild and severe symptoms and the convalescent samples of both patient types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Other than the resemblance between COVID-healthy samples and the vaccine-baseline samples, it was intuitively believed that the COVID-convalescence samples were similar to the vaccine-protection samples (P-state). What do these immune signals vary in the progression samples are of our interest.</p>
<p>Many of the abovementioned signals only showed an obvious turning point at convalescence group, including type I interferon productions, Tfh and B cell activation, TGF-&#x03B2;, cell-cycle, apoptosis and so forth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5A</xref>. and Fig.S3A-S3B). We were able to observe obvious signal boundary line between healthy/progression samples and convalescence samples. That means, unlike what happened in vaccination, some of the critical signals of immunity were not initiated but suppressed until the recovery.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="21256781v1_fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In general, there were many immune responsive signals in certain cell types in the progression samples whose trends were similar to those in R-state of vaccination. For examples, cytotoxic signal in T cells and NK cells significantly increased in the patients&#x2019; progression samples consistent with Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. and Wilk <italic>et al</italic>. study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (Fig.S3C).</p>
<p>We also revealed the distinctions between disease immunity and vaccination immunity using both datasets, especially for type I and type II MHC. In those antigen presenting cells like B cells and monocytes, type I MHC signal significantly decreased in vaccine response group (R group) whereas it tended to increase in the progression patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5B</xref>). Type II MHC signal was suppressed in progression in both mild or severe patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5B</xref>), whereas it was up-regulated during the vaccination. Another distinction was that T cells exhaustion signal went down in vaccination but went up in progression patients (Fig.S3C).</p>
<p>In summary, we identified the distinct signal variation patterns between the COVID-19 progression and vaccination samples, such as 1. type I and II MHC signals 2. T cells exhaustion signal.</p>

<title>Potential effects of the identified variable classical immune signals in flu vaccination</title>
<p>To further evaluate the responsive role of the variable classical immune signals we had identified in inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, a specific comparison was adopted with a public scRNA-seq data set on the lymph nodes and PBMC samples of the quadrivalent influenza vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. This data set was designed for a single-dose vaccine and included 5 time points of PBMC samples with a long post-vaccination follow-up time (2 months).</p>
<p>Using the 15 variable signaling keywords identified in BBIBP-Corv vaccination and the involved differential genes, we calculated their modular scores for each cell in flu dataset. The signal curves showed that 28-day sample gave the most obvious variation in response to the flu vaccine compared to other time points. We were able to detect high B cell activation signal in B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5C</xref>), high cytotoxic signal in CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup>T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5D</xref>), and low TGF-&#x03B2; signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.5E</xref>) in most of the immune cells at 28-day time point.</p>
<p>Elevated B cell activation, elevated cytotoxic signals and suppressed TGF-&#x03B2; signal at 28 days suggested this sample was mostly corresponding to the COVID-19-vaccine samples at immune R-state. We were not able to detect the variation of other signature signals, possibly because their sampling missed the pivotal time point on this volunteer. The megakaryocytes also had shown the significant variation at the same time point, which was mentioned earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.4E</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we extensively investigated the variability of the single-cell transcriptomes of the peripheral immune cells in the process of vaccination by a classical inactivated viral vaccine. Single-cell sequencing technology enabled us to deconvolute the immune-responsive signals into specific cell types.</p>
<p>Unsupervised clustering on the cell types from these samples defined three dominant clusters of the immune cells that were putatively corresponding to different immune-responsive states. Such an unbiased method overcame the challenge of sample grouping by the distinct immune-background, vaccine susceptibility or variable pace of immune responses by different participants.</p>
<p>The coordinated up-/down- regulation of the gene expressions of a certain signaling pathway suggested their involvement of the immune response during the vaccination. Tracking down the variation of these signals in a typical vaccination process allowed us to uncover their possible roles in the immune protection. Using this method, we observed the activation of both humoral immunity and cellular immunity by BBIBP-CorV, including cytotoxicity, follicular helper T mediated immunity as well as B cell activation <italic>et al</italic>. Meanwhile, our results provided a good reference for the future study of other vaccine types.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we observed the down-regulation of NF-&#x03BA;B signal in the post-BBIBP-CorV vaccination PBMC samples. Previous study suggested that the suppression of NF-&#x03BA;B signal likely alleviated the vaccine adverse reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, which might partially explain much less adverse reaction cases was reported by the vaccine recipients of BBIBP-CorV. Even though, the antibody productions of our participants were satisfactory.</p>
<p>The correlation between the top TCR/BCR clones and the modular scores of the keywords reveals what phenotypes have been associated with the clones of expansion. Some of the signature transcriptions identified in this work enabled us to capture the target B cells for full-length sequencing and molecular cloning of the antigen-specific antibodies.</p>
<p>The platelet aggregation signal and inflammatory signals were also inspected in the megakaryocytes due to the rising concern on the blood-clot side-effects reported on several vaccine types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This cell type was usually overlooked in immunity, though, in response to vaccine, the inflammatory gene expressions in megakaryocytes not only commensurate with the monocytes but also in a coordinated fashion. In addition, unlike severe COVID-19 samples and influenza vaccine samples, our result showed a down-regulation of blood-clot-related gene expression in our samples under active response (R-state), which likely explained the much fewer reports of thrombus-related adverse events by BBIBP-CorV vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.These findings necessitate a more extensive investigation on the roles of the megakaryocytes in the human immunity in the future.</p>
<p>The comparison of the immune-responsive signals between the COVID-19-progression and the vaccination allowed us to identify the discrepancy of immune responsive signals and made it possible to locate the missing puzzle pieces of the unsuccessful or incomplete immunity that contributed the symptoms in patients. These signaling pathways could be used to assess the immunity or as the target of the intervention for the control of COVID-19 symptoms or the vaccine adverse reaction. Though, more validation experiments will need to be done in the future.</p>
<p>We also inspected these signals using the dataset generated from a single-dose flu vaccine recipient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The results showed a significant fluctuation, especially, the B cell activation signal displayed a peak at 28-day. This was concordant to the detection of high content of CD20<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>int</sup> B cells from lymph nodes at 28-day in the original paper, though, a single case study might limit the power of this study.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. Due to the currently high cost of single-cell sequencing and inaccessibility of other vaccine type at the moment, the coverage and the size of sampling of this study are relatively limited, which limits the power of this study. Due to the urgent need of COVID-19 related research, the follow-up time couldn&#x2019;t be long enough, either.</p>
<p>Despite of these limitations, we were able to observe the protective immunity induced by BBIBP-CorV at the single-cell level and identified a set of genes that not only featured the immune-responsive variation of the peripheral immune cells but also exhibited many interpretable signaling pathways. The signature expression described in here might facilitate to design a new assay to assess the immune protection and adverse effects after the vaccination or infection recovery.</p>

The filtered scRNA-seq data were analyzed with the following steps: 1. To remove the cells with low quality, cells with fewer than 500 genes detected and a mitochondrial gene ratio of greater than 10&#x0025; were excluded. And genes with at least one feature count in more than three cells were used for the following analysis. 2. To remove potential doublets, cells with UMI counts above mean &#x00B1; 2SD are filtered out. Additionally, we applied DoubletFinder package (version 2.0.2) to identify potential doublets. 3. For each cell, we normalized the gene expression profiles with SCT-transform in Seurat package. 4. Variable genes were selected using the &#x2018;FindVariableFeatures&#x2019; function with the default parameters. 5.

The cells belonging to the top 20 TCR and BCR clones were labeled as &#x2018;top-clones&#x2019;. The gene expression signal and the immune responsive signals were compared between the top-clones and their counterparts using Seurat &#x2018;VlnPlot&#x2019; function.</p>
