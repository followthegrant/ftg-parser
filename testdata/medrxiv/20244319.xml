<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Scientific evidence shows that the Apgar score is a tool for assessing the response of a newborn during the transition towards extra uterine life. Virginia Apgar, who had the motto of &#x201C;Nobody, but nobody, is going to stop breathing on me&#x201D; created the scale in 1953.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> The Apgar score comprises 5 components: <italic>(i)</italic> colour; <italic>(ii)</italic> heart rate; <italic>(iii)</italic> reflexes; <italic>(iv)</italic> muscle tone; and <italic>(v)</italic> respiration, and it has been proposed and used as a tool for assessing the neonatal transition, the response to the extra uterine life, and the need for resuscitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Specifically, Apgar score helps to add efficacy of immediate resuscitative measures because the score should improve with resuscitation between 1, 5, and 10 or more minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scientific evidence suggests that the Apgar score is associated with the risk of neonatal and infant death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Also, a minor degree of physiological dysfunction soon after birth, reflected in the Apgar score, may indicate a slightly higher risk for developmental vulnerability in later childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Additionally, from a public health perspective, this score might serve as a population-level indicator of developmental risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even if the score has been used for decades, considering its possible usefulness for prognosis and follow-up, that has not been completely clarified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> It has been stated that 5-minute Apgar score of 7&#x2013;10 is reassuring, 4&#x2013;6 as moderately abnormal, and 0&#x2013;3 as low score in the term infant and late-preterm infant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the accuracy of that categorization in terms of risk stratification has been questioned by several studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Also, an Apgar score of &#x003C;5 at 5 min appears to be a good predictor of neonatal mortality in infants with a birth weight between 1500 g and 2499 g,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and provide prognostic information about neonatal survival among preterm infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite gestational age at birth is the most important determinant of neonatal mortality,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Apgar score shows its potential as a tool for estimating prognosis information in non-at-risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and at-risk neonates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Under current evidence, we hypothesize that the Apgar score at 5 minutes could be directly and independently associated with survival in at-risk neonates, even considering both: <italic>(i)</italic> the score divided in point-by-point <italic>strata</italic>, and <italic>(ii)</italic> the score divided in two-to-three points categories. The current study aims to assess such association.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Design</title>
<p>We performed a retrospective analysis of all registered deaths of neonates who died at &#x2264;28 days of life and were registered into the Surveillance System of Neonatal Mortality of the Ministry of Public Health of Ecuador, from January 2014 to September 2017. We excluded from the analyses those neonates whose information about their health care attendance and Apgar score at 5 minutes were missed (see the population flow-chart diagram in the <bold>Figure S1</bold> of the <bold>online supplementary material</bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Population and database</title>
<p>All registered neonatal deaths in public and private settings with available information on individual, contextual, and Apgar score were included in this study. The explanation about the construction of the database is available in the <bold>online supplementary material</bold>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Main outcome</title>
<p>We performed a survival analysis by setting the neonatal survival time, as measured by days of life, as the primary outcome. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of neonatal death by using: <italic>(i)</italic> Cox&#x2019;s proportional hazards models and <italic>(ii)</italic> inverse probability weighted (IPW) Cox regression, considering that the analyses were performed on a death registry (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. right truncation).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Main explanatory variable</title>
<p>Apgar score at 5 minutes was the main explanatory variable. We divided the score in two ways. First, using a point-by-point <italic>strata</italic>, except in the case of the score of &#x2264;4 points which was a single <italic>stratum</italic>. Second, a two-to-three points categories, as follows: <italic>(i)</italic> 0 to 2 points, <italic>(ii)</italic> 3 to 4 points, <italic>(iii)</italic> 5 to 6 points, <italic>(iv)</italic> 7 to 8 points, and <italic>(v)</italic> 9 to 10 points. We did not search for associations between Apgar scores at 1 and 10 minutes and neonatal survival given the lack of information about Apgar score at those time cut-offs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Other covariates</title>
<p>Several covariates were available in the database which we classified in two types: <italic>(i)</italic> individual covariates: gestational age at birth, birth weight, small for gestational age (&#x003C;10th percentile of birth weight for gestational age at birth)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> using the Intergrowth equations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> type of delivery, and comorbidities; and, <italic>(ii)</italic> contextual or &#x2013; the setting&#x2019;s &#x2013; covariates: type of health care facility and level of care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Statistical analyses and sample size considerations</title>
<p>The analyses were performed using the whole Ecuadorian neonatal mortality data registry from 2014 to 2017; consequently, a sample size calculation was unnecessary. Descriptive statistics were performed using percentages for categorical variables, median and P25 to P75 for discrete variables. To assess the differences of each individual and contextual variables across Apgar score categories, we performed: <italic>(i)</italic> Kruskal Wallis tests for assessing differences of gestational age; <italic>(ii)</italic> ANOVA for assessing differences in birth weight, <italic>(iii)</italic> Chi2 tests for assessing differences of small for gestational age, type of delivery, comorbidities, type of health care center, level of care; and, <italic>(iv)</italic> log-rank test for equality of survivor functions for assessing differences of neonatal survival time, as measured by days.</p>
<p>We estimated crude and adjusted HR with its corresponding 95&#x0025; confidence intervals (95&#x0025; CI) <italic>per</italic> each two-to-three points Apgar category.<sup>17</sup> In that sense, we built: <italic>(i)</italic> multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and <italic>(ii)</italic> inverse probability weighted (IPW) Cox regression [to address the right-truncation (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. death registry)], to evaluate the independent association between Apgar score and neonatal survival time. The model included all the individual and contextual variables, according to the criteria of the researchers.</p>
<p>We performed several secondary analyses to assess the sensitivity of our estimates to our assumptions regarding potential biases, as well as to test for model misspecification. Considering that differential treatment for individual causes of death could affect the estimates, we ran the model excluding neonates who died from <italic>(i)</italic> asphyxia related disorders, <italic>(ii)</italic> congenital malformations, <italic>(iii)</italic> prematurity related disorders, <italic>(iv)</italic> infectious disorders, and <italic>(v)</italic> those who died from other diseases that were not classified in the previous referred groups.</p>
<p>Given the small number of missing data (see footnotes in <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>), we employed a complete case analysis in estimating statistical associations. We considered that there were statistically significant differences when the p-value&#x003C;0.05. Finally, analyses were performed with Stata 14.2 (Statistical Software Stata: Release 14.2 College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). This study was part of the &#x201C;Score Beb&#x00E9;&#x201D; project and conducted with the approval of the Research Ethics Committee in Human Beings (<italic>CEISH</italic>) of the <italic>Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x00F3;lica del Ecuador</italic> (code number: 2018-09-EO).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We included in the study 2893 neonates who died between January 2014 to September 2017. Individual and contextual variables of the study population are described in Table <bold>1S</bold>. Of the total study population, 1380 (48&#x0025;) were female, had a median (P25 to P75) gestational age at birth of 31 (27 to 36) weeks, and had a mean (SD) weight at birth of 1651 (922) g. Regarding their perinatal characteristics, 759 (28&#x0025;) of them were small for gestational age, most of them (59&#x0025;) were born by a C-section with a median (P25 to P75) Apgar score at 5 minutes of 6 (4 to 8). The distribution of neonatal deaths per Apgar scale score at 5 minutes is shown in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1S</xref></bold>. Regarding the comorbidities they developed, prematurity related disorders were most frequent (31&#x0025;), followed by asphyxia related disorders (24&#x0025;), congenital malformations (23&#x0025;), and infectious diseases (18&#x0025;). Regarding their contextual variables, most deceased neonates were born in public health care facilities (73&#x0025;) and in secondary and tertiary level hospitals (98&#x0025;).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="20244319v1_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We found that each explanatory variable was associated with neonatal survival among at-risk neonates during univariate analyses. The median (P25 to P75) survival time in days of life was significantly longer per each increase in the Apgar score a 5 minutes as follows: 0.2 (&#x003C;0.1 to 2) days when it was &#x2264; 4 points, 2 (0.5 to 6.1) days when it was 5 points, 2.9 (1 to 8) days when it was 6 points, 3.1 (1. 2 to 8.9) when it was 7 points, 3.8 (1.5 to 10.4) days when it was 8 points, 4.4 (2 to 10.3) days when it was 9 points, and 5.5 (2.5 to 16.1) days when it was 10 points (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Similarly, when using the second categorization of the Apgar score, we found that Kaplan Meier survival estimates were significantly shorter when the Apgar was lower (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>During multivariate Cox proportional hazards modelling, after adjusting for gestational age, birth weight, small for gestational age, type of delivery, comorbidities and contextual variables, and considering an Apgar score of 9 to 10 points as the reference, the adjusted HR (95&#x0025; CI lower to upper limits) was 32&#x0025; (27&#x0025; to 37&#x0025;) higher per each decrease in the Apgar score at 5 minutes of two-to-three points category (<italic>p-value</italic> for trend &#x003C;0.01, see <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>A similar increase in the HR <italic>per</italic> each decrease in the Apgar category was found when we stratified the analysis across gestational age at birth categories, as follows: 41&#x0025; (34&#x0025; to 48&#x0025;, <italic>p-value</italic> for trend &#x003C;0.01) increase when neonates had &#x003C;34 weeks of gestational age, 39&#x0025; (25&#x0025; to 54&#x0025;, <italic>p-value</italic> for trend &#x003C;0.01) increase when neonates had 34 to &#x003C;37 weeks, 24&#x0025; (14&#x0025; to 34&#x0025;, <italic>p-value</italic> for trend &#x003C;0.01) increase when neonates had 37 to &#x003C;41 weeks. For those who had &#x2265;41 weeks (n=56) the hazard ratio was higher in most strata by comparison with a better Apgar score (9 to 10) at 5 minutes (<bold><xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref></bold> and <bold>Figure 3S)</bold>, but the trend was not statistically significant (<italic>p-value</italic> for trend = 0.97).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>When we performed the IPW Cox proportional hazards models after artificial cutting-off of the follow up at 21 days, the adjusted survival estimates yielded very similar results corroborating a &#x201C;dose-response&#x201D; shape in the association between Apgar score and survival time in days of life, at both, the whole sample and stratified by gestational age at birth categories (<bold><xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold> and <bold>Figure 4S</bold>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Sensitivity analyses performed to assess if the estimates changed with specific exclusions yielded similar results too (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2S</xref></bold>). Consequently, excluding <italic>(i)</italic> asphyxia related disorders, <italic>(ii)</italic> congenital malformations, <italic>(iii)</italic> prematurity related disorders, <italic>(iv)</italic> infectious disorders, and <italic>(v)</italic> other disorders non previously classified, did not change the estimates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Apgar score has a strong potential for neonatal mortality prognosis among at-risk neonates because it was directly associated with neonatal survival. Scientific evidence suggests that it is associated with long-term neurodevelopment outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and long-term mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> In that sense, we support its usefulness for survival prognosis among at-risk neonates, even when using more granular categorizations of the Apgar score, like point-by-point and two-to-three points strata. Also, we demonstrated that this association is independent of gestational age at birth and other individual and contextual determinants.</p>
<p>Our results show similarities with other studies about Apgar prognosis in at-risk neonates; for example, it has been previously demonstrated that premature neonates with a low 5-minute Apgar score have higher risk of mortality and of receiving intensive care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,18</sup> Other studies demonstrated association between the Apgar score and mortality in neonates, infants, and late childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no standardized categorization of the Apgar score at 5 minutes. However, our findings suggest that a more disaggregated categorization would help to estimate complications and death among at-risk neonates; and probably, among infants and children.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that there is much left to be done to reduce preventable neonatal death in Latin American and the Caribbean,<sup>19</sup> like substantially improving access to health care services, assuring universal facility-based delivery, and enhancing emergency obstetric and timely neonatal interventions.<sup>20</sup> In the specific case of Ecuador, the lack of such effective interventions have affected neonatal mortality causing its increase from 4.6 to 6.0 neonatal deaths <italic>per</italic> 1000 live newborns since 2014 to 2019.<sup>21</sup> In that sense, enhancing newborn care is an outstanding debt from the State to society, and urgent interventions are required.</p>
<p>Also, Apgar score assessment, and particularly a change in the score in between 1 minute and 5 minutes, is a useful index of the response to resuscitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> A standardized Apgar assessment for helping decision-making processes during the early care of at-risk neonates should assure timely health care interventions across Apgar bands of risk. Therefore, it is possible that Apgar and neonatal care training for health care workers, appropriate supply of inputs, and a substantial improve in communication during neonatal transport, could substantially contribute to reduce the neonatal mortality rate in Ecuador.</p>
<p>Our study had several strengths. Using a nationwide database assures statistical power and a proper inclusion of the whole casuistic of at-risk neonates in Ecuador. Also, our study included several individual and contextual covariates as potential confounders, reducing the risk of confounding bias.</p>
<p>As a main limitation, we recognize that it is difficult to assess the quality of the Apgar score information that we used in our analyses. It is important to mention that, despite the lack of specific knowledge about the training on the Apgar score assessment of health care workers, the current Ecuadorian regulations include Apgar assessment as a compulsory process.<sup>22,23</sup> This has been used in the country for more than 25 years. Therefore, it is a common and very interiorized process for most health care professionals at different levels of care and in private and public settings.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the lack of information about Apgar score at 1 and 10 minutes of life, which precludes a more comprehensive assessment of Apgar as a prognosis tool. Even if a potential source of selection bias is possible due to the use of a death registry database, we employed the IPW Cox proportional hazards modelling which resulted in similar estimates than our fixed-effects Cox models. Consequently, we consider that right-truncation is a non-significant source of bias.</p>
<p>Finally, the lack of non-at-risk neonates in the analyses precludes a proper assessment of the usefulness of score in healthier neonates. Nonetheless, previous evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> supports our findings, indicating that Apgar score could be used as a prognosis tool of neonatal mortality at both, at-risk and non-at-risk neonates.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is a strong direct association between Apgar score at 5 minutes and neonatal survival in neonates considered at-risk. This association is strong, even when stratifying the analyses across gestational age categories. These findings highlight the usefulness of the Apgar score at 5 minutes for decision-making processes for health professionals during the early care of at-risk neonates.</p>
