<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Although the major determinant of disease severity in patients with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is whether their dystrophin gene (<italic>DMD</italic>) mutation disrupts the mRNA reading frame or allows expression of a partially functional protein, other genes have been proposed or demonstrated to modify the severity of disease progression. In a companion paper to this one, we describe our novel approaches to genome-wide association study (GWAS) of loss of ambulation (LOA) in the largest genome-wide search to date for loci influencing disease severity in DMD patients. Candidate regulatory SNPs that modify disease progression were identified using an evidential statistical paradigm and here we present a uniform application of recent functional genomic datasets to explore the potential functional impact of the top six candidate regions with PPLD scores of &#x2265;0.4. The results of this analysis of the largest DMD GWAS survey to date elucidate recurrent and potentially new pathways for intervention in the dystrophinopathies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mutations in <italic>DMD</italic>, encoding the dystrophin protein, result in the X-linked dystrophinopathies. The most common of these are the severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and the milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), with some patients demonstrating an intermediate phenotype. The primary determinant of disease severity depends upon whether the mutation truncates the <italic>DMD</italic> open reading frame, ablating dystrophin expression, or maintains an open reading frame, allowing expression of a partially functional muscle-specific (Dp427m) dystrophin isoform.</p>
<p>Although treatment with corticosteroids or environmental factors may alter the age of loss of ambulation (LOA) in patients who lack dystrophin expression, increasing evidence implicates other genetic modifiers of severity, including proteins involved in inflammation, fibrosis, regeneration, and sarcolemma repair <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Protein polymorphisms in latent TGF-&#x03B2; binding protein 4 (<italic>Ltbp4</italic>) are associated with increased levels of TGF&#x03B2;-mediated fibrosis in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and a common human <italic>LTBP4</italic> haplotype has been associated with disease severity. The matricellular protein osteopontin (<italic>Spp1</italic>) contributes to the balance between inflammatory, regenerative, and fibrotic processes in muscle, and common regulatory SNPs in the proximal promoter of <italic>SPP1</italic> are associated with variations in age at LOA in DMD patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Cohort effects of <italic>SPP1</italic> and <italic>LTBP4</italic> SNPs are evident with variable success at replication <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, but the effects of the &#x201C;protective&#x201D; and &#x201C;risk&#x201D; human LTBP4 polymorphisms on the dystrophic phenotype in mice have been confirmed, with epistatic interactions between <italic>Spp1</italic> and <italic>Ltbp4</italic> in modulating fibrosis via pathological TGF&#x03B2; signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The sarcolemmal repair protein and downstream effector of TGF&#x03B2; signaling annexin A6 (<italic>Anxa6</italic>) modulates severity in mice, with alleles of <italic>Ltbp4</italic> and <italic>Anxa6</italic> acting jointly to modify the dystrophic phenotype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The Notch signaling pathway gene <italic>Jagged1</italic> modifies severity in the golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dog model, implicating a role for satellite cell self-renewal and quiescence in severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Prior GWAS studies used different phenotypic classification schemes and statistical analyses than what we describe here. The first, utilizing an exome chip in 109 ancestrally homogeneous sample implicated a functional SNP (rs1883832) in the Kozak sequence of the <italic>CD40</italic> gene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, which encodes a costimulatory receptor mediating immune and inflammatory responses. The second, from our group, was a preliminary GWAS using 253 non-ambulant subjects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> in which we observed two loci above the genome-wide significance threshold using the recessive model. One locus was <italic>LTBP4</italic> itself, where fine mapping revealed <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL variants in linkage disequilibrium with &#x201C;protective&#x201D; IAAM LTBP4 protein isoform and associated with <italic>LTBP4</italic> mRNA expression. The other locus was a distal enhancer containing <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL variants associated with expression of thrombospondin-1 (<italic>THBS1</italic>), encoding a matricellular protein with multifunctional properties including promoting TGF&#x03B2; signaling through latent protein complex activation. Finally, a recent two-stage design using whole exome sequencing of extreme phenotypes identified <italic>TCTEX1D1</italic> as an LOA modifier <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Such studies highlight the importance of novel study designs in searching for modifiers of DMD.</p>
<p>As described in a companion paper [citation], we have performed a GWAS analysis on N=419 dystrophinopathy patients using a different approach. Specifically, we used a <italic>novel and conservative approach to classifying DMD genotypes</italic> to minimize the potential influence of residual dystrophin expression on phenotype, used <italic>a new form of survival analysis</italic> residual to evaluate how unexpected is an individual&#x2019;s age at loss of ambulation, and used <italic>an evidential statistical paradigm</italic> to identify candidate SNPs that modify disease progression. Here we describe the <italic>uniform application of recent genome-wide datasets</italic> to that candidate SNP data to reveal their functional impact. Beginning with six candidate loci identified in the GWAS study, we were able to implicate several novel regulatory loci as potential modifiers of DMD severity. Utilizing a systematic <italic>in silico</italic> pipeline integrating ENCODE genomic annotations, chromatin interaction experiments, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and <italic>in silico</italic> functional predictions, we consider the biological plausibility of these candidate modifiers as a first step toward further studies to determine pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The study design is described in detail in the companion paper, as is the subject cohort [Flanigan et al., medXriv, 2021]. GWAS was based on the posterior probability of (trait-marker) linkage disequilibrium (PPLD) to assess evidence for or against association between LOA and each SNP in turn. The rationale for the selection of and the advantages of the PPLD over regression analysis in the context of GWAS based on small to moderate sample sizes are detailed elsewhere <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The methods of (i) functional annotation and eQTL analysis of candidate loci and (ii) analysis of genomic regulatory features are included in the Supplemental Methods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A PPLD threshold &#x2265; 0.05 defined credible sets from the top 6 regions, identifying 96 total SNPs for detailed analysis. Functional annotations of individual SNPs (Table S1) revealed that all 96 SNPs were noncoding intergenic or intronic variants. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the lead candidate SNP from each of the regions associated assigned to a candidate protein coding gene using the Open Target Genetics V2G pipeline with the gene expression data (eQTL) supporting this connection. These six credible SNP sets with a PPLD score &#x2265; 0.4 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were non-coding and therefore we examined these genomic regions for biological features indicative of functional regulatory variation. These included ENCODE candidate <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (cCREs), ENCODE indexed DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), ENCODE transcription factor footprints, gene proximity, enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions, skeletal muscle total RNA expression, and <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs SNP-gene pairs from the GTEx and the eQTL Catalogue databases.</p>

<title>Credible SNP set, eQTLs, and chromatin features</title>
<p>The nearest protein-coding gene to the chr2 rs34263553 SNP with the highest PPLD value (0.87) is the Ewing tumor-associated antigen 1 (<italic>ETAA1</italic>) gene, at a distance of 335 kb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). One-to-all Hi-C chromatin and pCHi-C data support a physical interaction between the rs34263553 region and the <italic>ETAA1</italic> promoter region in psoas muscle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Table S3). This region also coincides with a <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL data associated with <italic>ETAA1</italic> expression in T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Table S2). The credible rs34263553 SNP interval contains multiple cCREs with both distal enhancer-like and CTCF-only signatures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and the lead SNP rs34263553 is also located within a stromal B index DHS (Table S4), flanked upstream by an enhancer cluster and downstream by a CTCF-binding site with a prominent DHS peak in multiple tissues/cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The 12 SNPs in the rs34263553 PPLD credible set coincided completely with the 13 SNP fine mapped <italic>ETAA1</italic> eQTL credible set defined by the SuSiE method and rs34263553 had the highest posterior probability of being the causal eQTL variant for <italic>ETAA1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Regulatory features in the vicinity of rs34263553 include the phylogenetically conserved enhancers, the strong CCCCTC-Binding factor (CTCF) site active in many cell types, and a nearby binding site for FOXA1/A2 pioneer transcription factor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In the mouse, <italic>Etaa1</italic>-deficient T cells display elevated DNA damage during proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and the negative beta value in T cells for the <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL suggests that the minor allele of rs34263553 is associated with decreased <italic>ETAA1</italic> expression in humans.</p>

<title>ETAA1 as a plausible modifier gene</title>
<p>ETAA1 is an activating protein for ATR, the major kinase regulating replication stress and the DNA damage response pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The ETAA1-ATR complex has a role in monitoring the completion of S phase and in regulating the S/G2 cell cycle transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. <italic>Etaa1</italic>-deficient mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> have defects in processes requiring rapid cell proliferation, including deficiencies in clonal T cell expansion and incompletely penetrant embryonic lethality. Rapid proliferation is a requirement for muscle stem cells (MuSCs) to participate in repair and regeneration of damaged myofibers caused by the loss of dystrophin. ETAA1-dependent activation of ATR during mitosis has also been shown to be important for Aurora B kinase (AURKB) signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and in preventing chromosomal misalignments during metaphase. A plausible role for ETAA1 as a modifier would be in maintaining genome integrity and chromosomal stability of the muscle stem cell population.</p>

<p>Altered <italic>MAN1A1</italic> expression could theoretically impact muscle ion channel function, muscle cell adhesion, and muscle stem cell function. For example, removal of sialic acids via lowered <italic>MAN1A1</italic> expression will increase high mannose N-linked glycosylation and could cause dramatic depolarizing shifts in NaV channels, as can occur when muscle cells are treated with neuraminidase, which removes sialic acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Removal of muscle N-linked sialic acid can also remove hyperpolarizing shifts in the &#x03B2;1 chain of the NaV channel and can increase conductance of muscle voltage-gated calcium channels, which could impact calcium homeostasis, which is known to be altered in muscular dystrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. <italic>KLOTHO</italic> has been shown to ameliorate muscular dystrophy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and alter muscle regeneration and muscle mitochondria and stem cell function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.

<p>The nearest protein-coding gene to the chr8 rs3899035 region is neurocalcin delta (<italic>NCALD</italic>), a myristoylated calcium sensor protein that shows calcium-induced binding to lipid bilayers. The credible SNP interval spans &#x223C;120 kb, including a <italic>NCALD</italic> promoter with multiple SNPs intersecting distal enhancer-like cCREs regulatory elements. This region of chr8 has been previously identified as harboring regulatory variants that modify spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) disease progression via reduced <italic>NCALD</italic> expression improving endocytosis defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.

<p>The ADAMTS19 protease belongs to a deeply diverged 19-member family with diverse functions associated with tissue morphogenesis, musculoskeletal development, and pathophysiological remodeling, and like LTBP4 and THBS1, is found in elastic fiber molecules, specifically fibrillin microfibrils <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.

These acromelic dysplasias share phenotypes including pseudomuscular build, short stature, joint stiffness, brachydactyly, and tight skin. Recessive LoF mutations of <italic>LTBP4</italic> also cause a fibrillin-related connective tissue disorder, cutis laxa type 1C (OMIM 613177). It has been proposed that the biological substrate underlying these phenotypes is a protein network on FBN1 microfibrils that brings LTBPs and ADAMTS proteases into physical proximity to form a TGF-&#x03B2; signaling hub in the ECM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.

<p>The Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-sensor NCALD has been shown to regulate cyclic GMP synthesis from atrial natriuretic peptide receptor coupled guanylate cyclase (ANP-RGC) in a non-hormonal, Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-dependent fashion and independently of ANP signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In cardiac and muscle cells, cGMP is generated both from nitric oxide (NO) activated soluble guanylyl cyclase and by activation of particulate guanylyl cyclases, such as ANP-RGC. Dystrophin loss results in the disruption of neuronal NO synthase localization, and muscle NO-cGMP signaling has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. A possible role for NCALD as a modifier of disease progression may be in regulating an alternate cGMP pathway and impacting the downstream signaling cascades disrupted by the loss of NO-activated cGMP synthesis. An additional target of regulatory variants in the rs3899035-tagged region may also be the zinc finger transcription factor Kr&#x00FC;ppel-like factor 10 (<italic>KLF10</italic>), which is functionally linked to credible SNP region by both eQTL and pCHi-C interactions.

<title>Functional evidence linking rs2061566 to E1929501 enhancer activity</title>
<p>We used ENCODE transcription factor (TF) footprints <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> to assess whether rs2061566 disrupted a regulatory protein binding site within the E1929501 enhancer. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> shows that rs2061566 intersects overlapping small MAF (musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma) binding sites for homo- and heterodimeric basic region leucine zipper-type (bZIP) TFs. The rs2061566 allelic effect on bZIP TF binding was tested using empirical DNA binding z-scores (CSI scores = cognate site identification 10mer intensity scores) from 109 bZIP TF homo- and heterodimeric pairs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We ranked CSI scores using a sliding window across a 21 bp. sequence centered on rs2061566 and observed a maximum CSI binding score for FOS-MAFB bZIP heterodimers at a position containing the alternate rs2061566 G allele (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Similar binding specificity was also observed for NFE2L1-MAFG heterodimers and the binding specificities of both bZIP TF heterodimers at position 5 were consistent with their representative heterodimer motifs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We tested this predicted gain-of-function effect by examining digital TF footprinting data from ENCODE tissue/cell biosamples heterozygous for rs2061566 (Table S5). The allelic imbalance observed for reads overlapping the rs2061566 site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) suggests that the rs2061566 G allele is associated with increased bZIP TF binding <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The cell type specificity and strength of the E1929501 enhancer &#x2013; <italic>PARD6G</italic> promoter interaction relative to other promoters in the region was examined using the activity-by-contact (ABC) model of enhancer-promoter maps from 131 human cell types and tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The ABC score measures enhancer&#x2013;gene connections based on enhancer activity derived from DHS and H3K27ac chromatin data and weighted by the frequency of normalized Hi-C chromatin interactions with individual promoters. Using a minimum threshold ABC score &#x003E;= 0.015, the E1929501 enhancer contacted 11 gene promoters in 18 (out of 131) samples (Table S6), and the E1929501 &#x2013; <italic>PARD6G</italic> promoter connection was observed in 12 of these 18 samples. A total of 84 ABC enhancer &#x2013; <italic>PARD6G</italic> promoter connections were observed in these 131 samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, Table S7), and we examined ABC enhancer scores from cell types that are representative for the components with the most prominent E1929501 DHS peaks, including megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor stem cells (myeloid/erythroid), skeletal muscle myoblasts (musculoskeletal), IMR90 fibroblasts (stromal A), and transformed MCF10A epithelial cells (cancer/epithelial).

<p>The location of rs2061555 in a prominent cCRE enhancer that has strong activity-by-contact chromatin links to the <italic>PARD6G</italic> promoter in stem cells and the altered transcription factor binding to the heterodimeric MAF motif was the most direct evidence we observed for a functional SNP effect.

Stem cell (including satellite cell) polarity is driven by the localization of this complex (PAR3-PAR6-aPKC) to the apical pole, along with the localization of the PAR1 complex to the basilar pole <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Analysis of 6 loci with PPLD scores of &#x2265;0.4 identified multiple genes suitable for further exploration, based upon multiple lines of evidence for plausibility for a biologic role for the identified SNPs in regulating genes or pathways potentially relevant to muscle biology. For each region, we systematically applied a search for features indicative of functional regulatory variation, for evidence of associated gene regulation by eQTL analysis, and for evidence of direct physical interaction via Hi-C interactions. This uniform approach provided multiple concordant lines of evidence supporting each of the candidate genes, each of which may play a role in muscle function or pathology. Although the PPLD approach suggested a distinct set of modifier loci from previously described candidates, the overlap of gene functions in these data sets suggests that recurrent biological pathways are affected.</p>
<p>Overlapping functions in muscle stem cell maintenance and division for <italic>ETAA1</italic> and <italic>PARD6G</italic> suggests a model connecting these two genes to dystrophin loss in satellite cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Impairments of the MuSC population in dystrophic muscle have been attributed to exhaustion due to constant activation, to defects in asymmetric cell division and reduction in myogenic precursor cells caused by an intrinsic lack of dystrophin in MuSCs, and to differences in the stem cell niche <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. In animal models of DMD, such as the Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy dog, increased expression of the Notch ligand Jagged1 is associated with a mild phenotype that is postulated to result from increased proliferation of myogenic precursors from MuSCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In an <italic>mdx</italic> mouse model engineered with defective telomerase activity, telomere shortening was associated with increased replicative senescence of <italic>mdx</italic> MuSCs and increased disease severity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In that model, telomere shortening induced markers of the DNA damage response which impaired MuSC differentiation into myotubes <italic>in vitro</italic> by interfering with MYOD-mediated activation of myogenic gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The SNP effects on <italic>ETAA1</italic> expression may suggest a vulnerability in rapidly proliferating MuSCs that activates the ETAA1-ATR signaling pathway during S and M cell cycle progression due to elevated replicative stress or incompletely replicated loci.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been shown that signaling through the Aurora A kinase (AURKA) cascade can rescue some of the polarity and asymmetric satellite cell division defects observed in <italic>mdx</italic> mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Stimulation of mouse Aurka activity through the EGFR signaling pathway increases the proportion of asymmetric cell divisions, while pharmacological inhibition of Aurka shifts the balance towards symmetric stem cell division. Prior work established that Aurora A kinase phosphorylates the ser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> residue of PARD6G and that this is a key step in regulating the composition of the PAR complex including the activation of &#x03B1;PKC and the release of the Lgl subunits. Independent of its role in the PAR complex, PARD6G also has a unique role in the two centrioles of the centrosome, where PARD6G preferentially associates with the older mother centriole to regulate centrosomal protein composition, including the formation of spindle poles that control the accurate segregation of DNA into the two daughter cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Thus, the regulatory SNPs identified for <italic>ETAA1</italic> and <italic>PARD6G</italic> may play multiple roles in cell polarity and asymmetric division which impact the response to dystrophin loss in satellite cells. The degree of impairment to the eventual deterioration of muscle integrity (and ultimately function) is arguably understudied and may be of increased importance to understand as microdystrophin constructs in gene therapy trials do not encode the Mark2-binding spectrin repeats. Along with the fact that muscle stem cells are poorly transduced <italic>in vivo</italic> by current AAV vectors and would poorly express transgene with the muscle-specific promoters currently in use, this raises the possibility that microdystrophin gene therapy will not correct fundamental muscle stem cell defects important to muscle maintenance.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Our results suggest new plausible candidates for genetic modifiers of DMD disease severity as measured by LOA. Studies that examine the interaction between large-effect monogenic mutations and small-effect modifier variants, such as the one described here, are few in number. It is notable that the associations of common SNPs detected with this study were all non-coding variants, consistent with the majority of GWAS-associated variants linked to human traits. Recent studies have observed that the polygenic background as measured by risk scores for common diseases such as coronary heart disease, breast cancer, and colon cancer, modifies the disease penetrance of hereditary forms of these diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, supporting a &#x2018;many modifiers&#x2019; model for monogenic disease phenotypes. That recurrent biological pathways are evident between the previously described DMD modifiers and the new set of potential modifiers we report here suggests that therapeutic strategies based on these pathways requires further understanding of their common physiological action in the context of the disease-causing mutation.</p>
