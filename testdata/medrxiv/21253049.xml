<title>Background</title>
<p>Neurological presentation with isolated/multiple cranial nerve palsy is normal and its different causes incorporate infection, autoimmune, neoplastic, and inflammatory pathologies. The etiological range may rely on geological areas. We attempted this study to investigate the clinical range and etiological profile of numerous cranial nerve palsy.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>This planned observational study was led from January 2020 to January 2021. All the patients with cranial nerve palsy coming to the neurology OPD were taken for examinations. Essential targets were to characterize anatomical disorder/cranial nerve combinations and to set up etiology. The primary goals were to examine related components. Patients with neuromuscular junction disorder, anterior horn cell disease, myopathies, first and second cranial nerve dysfunction were excluded from the study. All patients went through an organized convention of clinical assessment, examinations, and few particular examinations as per clinical protocol for analysis.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Cavernous sinus was the commonest anatomical condition of different cranial nerve paralyses and tuberculous disease was the commonest cause in this investigation.7<sup>th</sup> cranial nerve was the common isolated nerve involved with idiopathic ethology, diabetes was the most common cause overall found with third nerve involvement.</p>

<title>BACKGROUND</title>
<p>Isolated single/more than one LMN cranial neuropathies or disorder is a commonly encountered medical problem. The assessment of these patients is often overwhelming due to an extensive range of etiologies in addition to the capability for devastating neurologic consequences. Dysfunction of the cranial nerves can arise because of the lesion anywhere of their route from the intrinsic brainstem to their peripheral courses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>].</p>
<p>The afferent and efferent connections of the cranial nerves traverse through the meninges, subarachnoid space, bony structures of the skull, and superficial smooth tissues. The cranial nerve nuclei lie within the brain stem, as a result, the intra-axial pathologic system may additionally present, to begin with, the most effective cranial nerve disorder too. Therefore, many such pathologic approaches are manifested by using cranial nerve disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. There can be involvement of homologous nerves on the two aspects (i.e., bilateral facial palsy) or one-of-a-kind nerves on the identical or contra-lateral aspect. In some conditions, a set of nerves is involved in a discrete anatomic vicinity constituting distinct anatomical syndrome.</p>
<p>Maximum of the literature regarding etiologies of single/more than one cranial neuropathies include case reviews or case series. The biggest stated retrospective collection by way of Keane had 979 instances, collected over 12 months period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. There had been diverse locations and reasons for cranial nerve involvement and Tumours were the most common reason, however, an extensive proportion remained idiopathic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] vast and sequential involvements of cranial nerves point in the direction of the opportunity of malignant infiltration of meninges, however, confirmation of diagnosis might not be feasible without biopsy or earlier than post-mortem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>In the Indian subcontinent, where infectious diseases are predominant, tuberculous meningitis is an important motive of cranial nerve palsies that is seen in nearly one-third of cases. The presence of cranial neuropathy is also associated with poor final results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Considering that there may be a paucity of Indian studies at the etiological spectrum of LMN cranial nerve palsy, we determined to adopt this observation with the purpose to evaluate clinical spectrum and causes of LMN cranial nerve palsies in tertiary healthcare institutions of India.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Maximum of the preceding literature concerning single/more than one cranial nerve palsies is either from the western nations or is in the form of case collection and case reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The etiological spectrum of more than one cranial nerve palsies is probably exclusive in a developing country like India.</p>
<p>We observed that the seventh cranial nerve is the isolated most common cranial nerve involved, followed by 3rd and 6th then coming 4th, fifth cranial nerves observed by others.</p>
<p>Idiopathic-stylomastoid foramen, superior orbital fissure, cavernous sinus, orbital apex, the base of the skull have been the order of anatomical localization within the extra-axial involvement of cranial nerves. Posterior circulation strokes followed by brainstem demyelination have been the maximum commonplace causes and localization within the intra axial involvement of cranial nerves. A number of the multiple cranial nerve combination involvement, the biggest collection of more than one cranial nerve palsies was published with the aid of Keane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. within Keane&#x2019;s series, the maximum common cranial nerve involved was also the abducens (VI) and the most common site become cavernous sinus. but the study through Keane become retrospective and included patients with neuromuscular junction disorders, brainstem syndromes, and cranial nerve palsies as a part of generalized neuropathic procedures like Guillain-Barre syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Multifactorial reason by way of diabetes was the most common etiology in our study, in contrast to western literature where tumor became reported to be the maximum common reason for multiple cranial neuropathies. This becomes expected, as the prevalence of diabetes is lots better in growing countries like India, in comparison to the evolved ones, followed by Hypertension, Alcoholism and Smoking, Ischemic Etiology for all the Cranial Nerves. Similar findings had been highlighted via Bhatkar and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Tuberculous and fungal infections were the maximum not unusual infections encountered in our study. Tuberculous meningitis is a not unusual purpose of a couple of cranial nerve palsy in India. The examination by way of Sharma and co-employees observed that cranial nerve involvement became found in 38% instances of tuberculous meningitis, with about 10% having more than one cranial nerve involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The fungal infections encountered in our examination generally offered with orbital apex, superior fissure, and cavernous syndromes; mucormycosis became the most common fungal infection determined in our study. Bhatkar et al. stated 24.6% cases of fungal contamination, aspergillosis being the most common cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Bilateral involvement and speedy onset vision loss have been seen more in fungal infection compared to other aetiologies, additionally proven by way of Chua et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Imaging findings in patients with fungal infection showed para-nasal sinusitis, multiple focal regions of bony destruction, heterogeneous signal intensity and contrast enhancement of orbit, nasal sinuses, and cavernous sinus. several studies were cited in the literature concerning radiological findings in CNS fungal infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Tolosa Hunt syndrome, diagnosed by way of ICHD-III standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] was seen in eleven% of our cases. This frequency became decrease compared to the previous case series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Tolosa Hunt syndrome is an essential cause of painful ophthalmoplegia, however, the etiology remained unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. In our study, all six patients had MRI abnormalities, like those mentioned in advance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] strong gadolinium enhancement of cavernous sinus wall with or without focal narrowing of ICA inside the cavernous sinus. Two out of six sufferers had kind 2 diabetes mellitus. Such co-lifestyles have been mentioned in current case reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Metastasis observed with the aid of schwannoma was the maximum not unusual tumors (benign/malignant) main to more than one cranial neuropathies in our study. in Keane&#x2019;s series,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] schwannoma become discovered to be the most common tumor, whilst inside the cavernous sinus syndrome series of Bhatkar et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] Metastasis changed into more common than the primary tumor.</p>
<p>For some of the lower cranial nerves, the most common combination becomes the IX, X, and XII cranial nerves. Out of the six cases, 3 had been of tumors (one case every of pontine glioma, jugular schwannoma, and nerve sheath tumor extending from craniovertebral junction to C2 vertebra). Common reasons for lower cranial nerve palsies include vascular, stressful, neoplastic, iatrogenic, and infective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Additionally, trauma, vasculitis, which is a commonplace group of problems supplying with multiple cranial neuropathies, was also encountered in our study. A bigger study would substantiate all the various companies of issues that can be pronounced in literature.</p>
<p>Therefore, to finish, amongst more than one cranial neuropathies, cavernous sinus syndrome and orbital apex syndrome have been the most common anatomical pattern of involvement, and infections which include tuberculous and fungal were the most common reasons for cranial nerve palsy in our collection. Bigger studies with long-term follow-up are needed in India to evaluate the causal association. despite exhaustive workup, an etiological prognosis can&#x2019;t be reached in each case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
