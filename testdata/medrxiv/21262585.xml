<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study, low maternal vitamin B12 and high folate concentrations during pregnancy predicted adiposity and insulin resistance (diabesity) in the children. Based on these findings, we designed an RCT (PRIYA) to provide these nutrients pre-conceptionally to reduce diabesity in the offspring. The interventions included: 1) vitamin B12&#x002B;multi-micronutrients and protein supplement (B12&#x002B;MMN), 2) vitamin B12 alone, and 3) placebo. A total of 149 women became pregnant and delivered in the trial. We report results of RNA sequencing in the cord-blood mononuclear cells in 88 deliveries. Gene expression analysis revealed 20 differentially expressed genes (FDR &#x003C;0.1, a discovery threshold) between the B12&#x002B;MMN and placebo groups. The enriched biological processes included: chromosome segregation, nuclear division and organelle fission. A cell cycle checkpoint gene <italic>Claspin (CLSPN)</italic> was expressed less in the B12&#x002B;MMN group but proliferation markers did not differ. No difference was observed between the B12 alone and placebo groups. The B-complex vitamins are essential for nucleotide synthesis and generation of S-Adenosyl Methionine, a universal cellular methyl donor and thereby may contribute to the regulation of gene expression. Vitamins A and D, and zinc in MMN may also influence gene expression. We propose that the multi-micronutrient intervention influenced rate of progression of specific phases of cell cycle without affecting proliferation. Vitamin B12 alone was not sufficient.</p>
<p>We highlight a novel molecular mechanism for the effect of multi-micronutrients during fetal development, and a plausible mechanism for intergenerational nutritional programming. Follow up studies will help understand their implications on the future phenotype.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) paradigm proposes that the environment during crucial stages of development modifies gene expression through various epigenetic changes which permanently affect the structure and function of an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Heindel and Vandenberg, 2015</xref>). The DOHaD paradigm was derived from Prof. David Barker&#x2019;s demonstration that lower birth weight (indicative of poor fetal nutrition) was a risk factor for future diabetes and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barker et al., 1989</xref>) and suggests a preventable susceptibility factor for these conditions.</p>
<p>Methylation of DNA and histones are two epigenetic modifications which influence gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cedar and Bergman, 2009</xref>). Methylation is affected by dietary nutrients which provide or generate methyl groups for cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Switzeny et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kok et al., 2015</xref>). These include vitamins B12, folate, B2, B6, choline, betaine, and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Zeisel, 2017</xref>). Vitamins A and D are also known to influence gene expression through their interaction with the nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Pasing et al., 2017</xref>). Deficiency of these nutrients in the diet of a pregnant mother manifests in various developmental defects (neural tube defects, midline congenital defects etc.) and fetal growth abnormalities (growth restriction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gernand et al., 2016</xref>). Deficiencies of these nutrients in early life are also associated with an increased risk of non-communicable diseases in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deshmukh et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The Pune Maternal Nutrition Study (PMNS) is a community based pre-conceptional birth cohort started in 1993. We found that two thirds of the pregnant mothers had low vitamin B12 status but folate status was adequate in the majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Yajnik et al., 2007</xref>). Low maternal B12 status coupled with normal to high folate status was associated with increased diabesity (adiposity and insulin resistance) in the children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Yajnik et al., 2007</xref>). Vitamin D deficiency in the mothers was associated with increased adiposity in the children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Wagh et al., 2020</xref>). These findings led to the Pune Rural Intervention in Young Adolescents (PRIYA) trial (ISRCTN 32921044 and CTRI 2012/12/003212) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kumaran et al., 2017</xref>). The trial provided vitamin B12 and other micronutrients along with milk proteins to the women in the PMNS cohort with a view to reduce the risk of diabesity in their offspring. The PRIYA trial started from the pre-conceptional stage and continued until delivery of the offspring. The trial provided an opportunity to study the effects of maternal micronutrient supplementation on changes in DNA methylation, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome in the cord blood of the newborn. In this paper, we report our early findings of cord blood transcriptome analysis in the PRIYA trial.</p>

<title>The PRIYA trial</title>
<p>PRIYA is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent participants of the PMNS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The rationale and methods of the PRIYA trial are described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kumaran et al., 2017</xref>). In short, 690 adolescent participants were screened for B12 levels to rule out severe vitamin B12 deficiency (plasma vitamin B12 concentration &#x003C;100 pmol/L) or severe anaemia (blood hemoglobin concentration &#x003C;70 gm/L) for ethical imperatives of a placebo controlled trial. Those with chronic medical conditions were also excluded. Eligible participants were randomised into 3 supplementation groups: 1) vitamin B12 (2 &#x00B5;g/day) along with multi-micronutrients as per UNIMMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">World Health Organization, 1999</xref>), excluding folic acid and conforming to local regulatory requirements (Supplementary Table 1), 2) Placebo, 3) vitamin B12 (2 &#x00B5;g/day) alone. The multi-micronutrient group also received 20 gm of milk powder every day and all 3 groups received iron and folic acid as per Government of India approved dosage (60 mg elemental iron &#x002B; 500 &#x00B5;g folic acid once a week before pregnancy and at least 100 tablets during pregnancy). The trial intervention was continued until delivery of the first live child.</p>

</fig>
<p>Monthly supplementation was provided by local field staff, which was in regular touch with the participants. Marriages were recorded and the pregnancies were diagnosed by a urine pregnancy test. At 28-weeks&#x2019; gestation, an obstetric consultation as well as blood tests were performed. The field staff monitored the pregnant women and helped transfer them for delivery at the KEM Hospital, Pune. Trained research staff attended the deliveries and collected cord blood samples as per a standardised protocol. Details of the delivery and baby&#x2019;s measurements were also recorded. A cord blood aliquot was transferred to RNAlater (QIAGEN, Germany) tubes and stored at -80&#x00B0;C till further processing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Blood measurements</title>
<p>Plasma vitamin B12, holo-TC, folate, vitamin B6, and total homocysteine were measured at baseline (before starting the supplementation), 6-12 months after starting supplementation, at 28 weeks gestation, at delivery, and in the cord blood. Vitamin B2 was also measured at these time-points except at the baseline. Supplementary Table 2 describes the laboratory methods used for these measurements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Statistical methods for clinical characteristics</title>
<p>The data for maternal and neonatal clinical characteristics is represented as median (IQR). The significance of difference between intervention groups was tested by Mann-Whitney test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Isolation of cord blood mononuclear cells</title>
<p>Mononuclear cells from the cord blood were extracted after depleting RBCs from whole blood. In brief, batches of frozen blood samples were thawed and diluted with one volume of phosphate buffer saline supplemented with EDTA (2mM). One volume of RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend # 420301) was added to the diluted samples and incubated for 5 minutes at RT. The tubes were centrifuged at 350 x g for 15 min at 4&#x00B0;C and the pellets were processed for RNA isolation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>RNA isolation, sequencing and data analysis</title>
<p>Cord blood mononuclear cells were subjected to RNA isolation using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen). Quantitation of RNA was performed on Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific #Q33238) using RNA HS Kit (Thermo Scientific #Q32852). Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol (Illumina). Briefly, each sample was run on 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent #G2939BA) to check its integrity. About 500 ng of total RNA from each sample was used to make libraries using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina #20020594). After final quantification and pooling, the libraries were run on Illumina HiSeqX platform, with 150 nucleotides long paired end reads as the output.</p>
<p>The raw sequence reads were aligned to the human genome (hg38, Gencode) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Frankish et al., 2019</xref>) using HiSAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). The resulting BAM files were used to generate a count matrix using featureCounts for known genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Liao et al., 2014</xref>). The count matrix was used for differential expression analysis using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Since the samples were processed in batches, the batch numbers were used as a covariate. The sex of the child was also used as a covariate. For this discovery analysis we used a p-value adjusted to the FDR of 0.1 as a cut off. The fold change was log transformed to the base 2 as per the convention. Significantly differentially expressed genes were subjected to gene enrichment analysis using clusterProfiler (v3.14.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Yu et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Trial progress and clinical findings</title>
<p>Six hundred and ninety adolescent participants in the PMNS were screened for inclusion in the PRIYA trial (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). A total of 133 were excluded and 557 (266 girls, 291 boys, average age 17 years) were randomized into 3 groups. A total of 182 girls married, 166 became pregnant and 149 delivered in the study. Cord blood samples were available on 138 for gene expression analysis. This paper reports transcriptome measurements on the first 88 cord blood samples (40 girls, 48 boys). These 88 pregnancies were comparable to the 50 who were not included in this study [with respect to maternal age, body mass index (BMI), socio-economic status, and hemoglobin concentrations at 28 weeks gestation, p &#x003E; 0.05].</p>
<p>The mothers were on average 21 years old and weighed 53.0 kgs with a BMI of 22.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at 28 weeks gestation (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Twenty-three mothers delivered by caesarean section. The average birth weight of babies was 2.8 kg (11.3&#x0025; were low birth weight i.e., &#x003C;2.5 kg), 3.4&#x0025; were born pre-term. There was not significant difference in the birth size and pregnancy outcomes in the 3 intervention groups.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>At baseline (at 17 years of age) plasma vitamin B12 concentrations were low and 47.7&#x0025; were B12 deficient (&#x003C;150 pmol/L), only 1&#x0025; were folate deficient (&#x003C;7 nmol/L). Plasma homocysteine concentrations were high, 91&#x0025; had hyperhomocysteinemia (&#x003E;15 &#x00B5;mol/L). B12, folate and homocysteine concentrations were similar in the 3 intervention groups.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows serial concentrations of vitamin B12, holo-TC (&#x2018;active&#x2019; B12), folate and homocysteine during the trial. It can be seen that mothers in the two vitamin B12 supplemented groups had higher vitamin B12 status compared to the placebo group after supplementation; and had lower homocysteine concentrations. Levels of vitamin B2 and B6 were the highest in the B12&#x002B;MMN group after supplementation (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Maternal hemoglobin concentrations and other hematological parameters were similar in the 3 groups.</p>

<p>Cord blood concentrations of vitamin B12, holo-TC and folate were higher than the maternal concentrations. Although vitamin B12 and holo-TC were higher in the B12 supplemented groups, the difference from the placebo group was not significant. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Cord blood hemoglobin concentration and red cell count were the highest in the group supplemented with B12 alone.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>RNA sequencing and differential gene expression analysis</title>
<p>Mononuclear cells from 88 cord blood samples were subjected to RNA sequencing. The quality of sequencing was assessed using FastQC (v0.11.8). The quality of sequencing, and read duplication levels were acceptable. Each sample generated approximately 50 million reads. The sample reads generally aligned well with the reference genome. Out of the 88 samples, 7 samples showed low alignment (alignment percentage &#x003C; 70&#x0025;) against the reference genome and were not considered for the downstream analysis. Our final analysis was therefore, on 81 samples. All samples showed comparable assignment to genes for generation of count matrix. The count matrix was used for differential expression analysis.</p>
<p>Samples showed clear separation based on the sex of the child on principal component analysis (PCA), however, no separation was observed based on laboratory batch or the intervention group (data not shown). No difference in gene expression was observed in the intervention groups based on gender. Differential expression analysis between the B12&#x002B;MMN group and placebo resulted in identification of 22 differentially expressed genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) (FDR&#x003C;0.1) of which 2 were pseudogenes (<italic>AC091057.1</italic> and <italic>DDX11L10</italic>) and were not considered for further analysis (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The log fold change ranged from -1.6 to 1.0.</p>

<p>To understand the gene-networking of the 20 differentially expression genes (DEGs), we performed analysis using STRING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Szklarczyk et al., 2019</xref>). Eighteen of the 20 DEGs were involved in gene networking while <italic>PRSS21</italic> and <italic>FAM72C</italic> were not part of the gene network and segregated separately (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). We used clusterProfiler to identify the top biological processes affected by the DEGs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Participants supplemented with B12&#x002B;MMN showed lower expression of genes associated with mitotic processes such as chromosome segregation, nuclear division, and organelle fission as compared to the placebo group. A cell cycle checkpoint gene, <italic>Claspin (CLSPN)</italic> also showed lower expression in the intervention group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). However, cell proliferation markers such as Cyclin D1 <italic>(CCND1), PCNA,</italic> and Ki-67 (<italic>MKI67</italic>) did not show significant differences in gene expression (data not shown). No differentially expressed genes were observed between placebo and the B12 alone group; however, the 20 genes differentially expressed between B12&#x002B;MMN and placebo were also under expressed in the B12 alone group (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). No significantly differentially expressed genes were observed between the two active supplementation groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we evaluated the effect of maternal pre-conceptional micronutrient intervention on the offspring&#x2019;s cord blood transcriptome. Vitamin B12&#x002B;MMN intervention resulted in differential expression of 20 genes predominantly influencing mitotic processes such as chromosomal segregation, nuclear division, organelle fission, etc. when compared to placebo. Vitamin B12 alone did not significantly influence the transcriptome compared to the placebo group, though these 20 differentially expressed genes showed a similar trend (under-expression). This is, to our knowledge, the first report of changes in cord blood gene expression after a maternal nutritional intervention started from before conception. The majority of similar studies have only reported changes in DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fryer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">McKay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">McCullough et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Nutritional deficiencies are common in the population of villages we have studied. Our intervention was based on our findings in earlier studies of substantial vitamin B12 deficiency in the participants and their parents. These villages are drought prone and residents have poor socio-economic status which would contribute to multiple micronutrient deficiencies and poor growth and development in babies. Our earlier observations showed that maternal vitamin B12 deficiency during pregnancy, coupled with higher levels of folate predicted higher adiposity and insulin resistance in the children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Yajnik et al., 2007</xref>). This prompted us to compare effects of supplementing vitamin B12 alone or in combination with other micronutrients on fetal outcomes. Our intervention showed a demonstrable increase in maternal vitamin B12, holo-TC, B2 and B6 levels in the multi-micronutrient group and of vitamin B12 and holo-TC in the B12 alone group. Though not measured, we would expect better nutrition of vitamins A, D and other micronutrients (vitamin E, Zn etc.) in the MMN group. An impressive fall in maternal homocysteine concentrations in both the active intervention groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) suggests better methylation status. These changes were evident within a few months of starting the supplementation and therefore ensured a better micronutrient status from the pre-conceptional stage and during pregnancy. The newborn in the B12&#x002B;MMN group showed higher concentrations of vitamins B2 and B6, in addition to vitamin B12 and holo-TC, though only B6 was significantly different from placebo (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Despite significant differences in the maternal circulation, the lack of differences in some of these micronutrients may be due to: alterations in placental transport, differences in binding to carrier proteins, or differential utilisation by the baby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Whitfield et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lager and Powell, 2012</xref>). An inspection of the one-carbon (1-C) metabolic cycle (Supplementary Figure 1) and its regulation by B-complex vitamins suggests that babies of mothers who received vitamin B12&#x002B;MMN would have a more comprehensive effect on purine and pyrimidine synthesis and therefore on DNA and RNA metabolism compared to those who received vitamin B12 alone. Reasons for higher hemoglobin concentration and red blood cell count in the vitamin B12 alone group are not immediately apparent.</p>
<p>A detailed analysis of our results suggested that of the 20 genes differentially expressed in the vitamin B12&#x002B;MMN group, 18 clustered in a network which regulates mitotic processes. The affected biological processes include chromosome segregation, nuclear division, organelle fission, etc. These results remind us of the changes described in the bone marrow of patients with pernicious anaemia (a severe vitamin B12 deficiency condition which creates a functional folate deficiency and affects 1-C metabolism in the direction of reduced methylation potential). The biochemical and morphological changes in pernicious anaemia are suggestive of disturbed DNA synthesis and repair as well as impaired cell division. A recent study on human astrocytes also showed that cobalamin (B12) deficiency impairs DNA synthesis and prolongs G2/M transition leading to cell growth without cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Rzepka et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>We also investigated the expression of standard cell proliferation markers such as cyclin D1, Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2 (MCM2), Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67 from the RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Whitfield et al., 2006</xref>). None of these proliferation markers showed a significant change in expression in any intervention group. However, <italic>CLSPN,</italic> an S-phase checkpoint gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Liu et al., 2006</xref>) showed lower expression in the B12&#x002B;MMN group as compared to placebo. We propose that a relative deficiency of micronutrients in the placebo group results in a compensatory increase in the expression of genes involved in nucleic acid synthesis and cell division triggered by hypomethylation of the relevant genes. However, micronutrient deficiency compromises the supply of nucleotides for DNA synthesis and replication resulting in activation of cell cycle checkpoint. On this background, it appears that genes related to DNA synthesis and cell division were underexpressed in the B12&#x002B;MMN group because the intervention led to increased micronutrient levels and better methylation status which would promote methylation of the relevant genes.</p>
<p>Our multi-micronutrient composition also included vitamins A and D, and zinc which are known to affect gene expression and cell proliferation in specific tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">MacDonald, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Blomhoff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Umar et al., 2018</xref>). We speculate that they could presumably contribute to some of our findings of gene expression differences over and above the combined effect of B-complex vitamins in improving cellular methylation potential.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>One of the major strengths of our intervention study is that it was guided by earlier nutritional observations in the same cohort. Supplementation in adolescents, much before their marriage and pregnancy made it truly pre-conceptional and had the potential of influencing peri-conceptional epigenetic reprogramming. We used &#x2018;physiological&#x2019; doses of micronutrients, which also makes it public health relevant. The limitations include that these preliminary results are on a relatively small number of cord blood samples which will improve after results on the remaining samples are available. The limited power could also have contributed to a lack of difference in the cord blood measurements between placebo and B12&#x002B;MMN groups or in body size measurements of the babies in the three groups. Another limitation is that our transcriptomic measurements are limited only to cord blood mononuclear cells which may not reflect changes in other tissues. The specificity of tissue response and temporal changes with gestation can be investigated only in animal models.</p>
<p>Our results provide perhaps the first human evidence for molecular effects of pre- and peri-conceptional maternal B12&#x002B;MMN intervention on cord blood. The intervention affected vital cellular processes like cell cycle regulation and cell division during fetal development. These are plausible mechanisms for influencing intrauterine programming. Follow up studies in children will provide an opportunity to investigate the association of these novel alterations to programming of body size and composition, metabolism and neurocognitive function.</p>
