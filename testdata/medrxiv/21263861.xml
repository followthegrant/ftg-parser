<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Rationale</title>
<p>Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have associated &#x003E;100 genetic loci with atrial fibrillation (AF), yet the biological pathways of AF remain elusive.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Objective</title>
<p>To determine candidate causal genes associated with AF risk loci and their coexpression partners, modules, biologic and mechanistic pathways.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods and Results</title>
<p>Cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) were identified for candidate genes near AF risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human left atrial tissues. Genes were categorized into 3 sets according to likelihood of being a causative AF gene: 1) All Candidate Genes (with significant eQTLs or previously prioritized); 2) Any eQTL Genes (with &#x2265;1 significant eQTL); and 3) Top GWAS SNP eQTL Genes (top SNP within the top 10 eQTL SNPs). Coexpression partners were identified for each candidate gene. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified modules and modules with overrepresentation of candidate AF genes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was applied to the coexpression partners of each candidate gene, and IPA and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to each WGCNA module. 166 AF-risk SNPs were located in 135 distinct loci. The All Candidate Genes group contained 233, the Any eQTL Genes group 131 (83 novel), and the Top GWAS SNP eQTL Genes group 37 genes. IPA identified mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, epithelial adherens junction signaling, and sirtuin signaling as the most frequent pathways. WGCNA characterized 64 modules; candidate AF genes were overrepresented in 8. Modules were represented by cell injury, death, stress, developmental, metabolic/mitochondrial, transcription/translation, and immune activation/inflammation regulatory pathways.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>AF candidate gene coexpression analyses suggest significant roles for cellular stress and remodeling in AF. We propose a dual risk model for AF: Genetic susceptibility to AF may not manifest until later in life, when cellular stressors overwhelm adaptive responses. These analyses provide a resource for further functional studies on potential causal AF genes.</p></sec>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects over 33.5 million worldwide, is strongly associated with aging and obesity, and is projected to increase further with the aging population and increasing prevalence of obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. AF is often initiated by triggers from the pulmonary vein ostia, which are targets for AF ablation, and maintained by vulnerable atrial substrates that promote AF propagation and persistence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Atrial substrates become vulnerable from structural, electrical, and autonomic remodeling promoted by conditions that can cause stretch, inflammation, oxidative stress, or calcium overload<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci associated with AF risk; the top locus is on chromosome 4q25 near <italic>PITX2</italic>, which has been implicated in pulmonary vein formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Using a collection of human left atrial appendage (LAA) tissue samples, we performed RNA sequencing (RNASeq) to identify cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs), where AF GWAS SNP genotypes correlated with the expression of nearby genes; we identified candidate genes and top eQTL SNPs for 12 of 23 AF GWAS loci known at that time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Since then, larger GWAS meta-analyses have identified over 100 AF risk loci, most of which have not yet undergone functional analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although some of the identified candidate genes have transcriptional products with known function, the biological function of many remain poorly understood in the heart. Whole-genome coexpression and pathway analysis of the candidate gene(s) associated with a target locus can provide insights into their mechanisms and regulation that can guide further functional studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To this end, we aimed to: 1) determine candidate causal genes associated with the expanded list of AF risk loci by identification of cis-eQTLs in human LAA tissues; 2) identify coexpression partners of AF candidate genes; and 3) identify biological pathways by which these genes might function, focusing on candidate genes whose functional connections to AF are poorly understood.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Left atrial tissue collection and processing</title>
<p>Human LAA tissues were obtained from 265 patients, including 251 who underwent elective cardiac surgery and 14 from non-failing unused transplant donors. Prior to 2008 verbal consent was obtained and documented in a process approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board. After this time written informed consent was obtained. Consent to use donor hearts was obtained from the family. The patient population, tissue processing, genomic DNA isolation, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, RNA isolation and sequencing have been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Briefly, DNA was genotyped using Illumina Hap550v3 and Hap610-quad SNP beadchips and SNP data imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project phase 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. RNA unstranded 100-bp paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Gene read counts are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE69890).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title><italic>Cis</italic>-eQTL analyses</title>
<p>RNASeq and eQTL statistical analyses were previously described, with cis-eQTLs defined as being &#x00B1;250 kb from the SNP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Expression values were obtained from aligned files using HTseq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Reads were quantile normalized, and gene counts for eQTL analysis were variance-stabilized transformed using the R package Deseq2. Samples were analyzed in R (version 3.4.4) using the surrogate variable analysis (SVA) and Limma R packages. eQTL analyses were performed for 235 samples of European descent and can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://afeqtls.lerner.ccf.org3">http://afeqtls.lerner.ccf.org3</ext-link>.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Determination of candidate AF risk genes</title>
<p>Using our mRNA-Seq eQTL database, we determined candidate genes near the top SNPs at each locus published from two recent GWAS meta-analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Genes were categorized into 3 sets according to likelihood of being a causative AF gene, from weakest to strongest: 1) All potential candidate AF genes (<underline>All Candidate Genes</underline>), consisting of genes with significant cis-eQTLs (q value &#x003C;0.05) from the two GWAS meta-analyses, or if no significant eQTL was identified, then the prioritized genes by Nielsen, et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>; 2) Genes with at least one AF SNP associated with its gene expression with q value &#x003C;0.05 from our eQTL study (<underline>Any eQTL Genes</underline>); and 3) eQTL genes with the top GWAS SNP within the top 10 eQTL SNPs (<underline>Top GWAS SNP eQTL Genes</underline>).</p>
<p>All Candidate Genes group is the most liberal and comprehensive list, including all cis-eQTL genes and non-cis-eQTL genes prioritized by Nielsen et al. (including prioritized genes that were not expressed in our LA mRNA-Seq database). This list allows for inspection of potential AF genes, such as <italic>PITX2</italic> or other developmentally active genes that are no longer highly expressed in adult left atrial appendage tissue, but which are still likely to play a significant role in AF development. Any eQTL Genes group includes those showing evidence of a gene expression relationship with an AF risk SNP. Top AF GWAS SNP eQTL Genes group is the most stringent list in level of specificity, but is also the lowest in sensitivity, including genes with the highest level of evidence for future functional studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Gene coexpression analyses</title>
<p>Coexpression analysis was performed for all genes in the All Candidate Genes group across the Ensembl genome database version 71. Each gene was included in individual linear models as a predictor with all other Ensembl genes as outcome, additionally controlling for AF rhythm, sex, age, and surrogate variables. The number of surrogate variables was determined using the R surrogate variable analysis (SVA) package; surrogate variables were recalculated for each of the genes. The SVA used unsupervised models to correct for the heterogeneity in gene expressions, such as batch effects, unknown factors, library depth, or comorbidities like AF status, history of structural heart disease, etc. We controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) of the multiple testing with the R q value package. Genes were considered significantly coexpressed if q value was &#x003C;0.05 (Supplemental Excel 1).</p>
<p>Expression correlations were also performed, limiting analyses to the genes within each gene group, i.e. the correlation of each candidate AF risk gene with all other AF candidate genes was calculated. Genes with a q value &#x003C;0.05 were considered significantly coexpressed. For each gene group, agglomerative hierarchical clustering with the compete linkage method was used, where genes start as singletons and are successively joined to form one cluster that contains all the genes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA)</title>
<p>WGCNA is a method to cluster genes into distinct modules by degree of connectivity determined by commonly coexpressed (as measured by correlation) genes. To construct the required correlation matrix for WGCNA, first the conditional mean (log<sub>2</sub> scale) of LAA gene expression was modeled using the limma-voom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> approach with an extensive set of known AF risk factors and other covariates. Residuals were calculated from this model to remove mean effects and used as inputs to the RSVP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> approach for estimating correlation matrices in the presence of latent factors. The RSVP adjusted correlation matrix was then normalized using the spqn approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> to remove the mean-variance bias common in RNA-seq data due to differential measurement error. A weighted gene correlation network was built using the RSVP-spqn adjusted and normalized correlation matrix using the CEMiTool R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Hub genes were defined as genes in the top 1% for intra-module connectivity (Supplemental Excel 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Candidate pathway identification</title>
<p>Canonical pathways, upstream regulators, and toxicity lists were identified using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software package (QIAGEN, Inc.). IPA uses gene expression data to predict biological pathways that are activated by comparing known genes within a set of pathways to expression patterns in the imported dataset. Ensemble ID number, q-value, and log fold change values for coexpressed genes were imported into IPA. Coexpressed genes with q values &#x003C;0.05 were used for analysis. Significance of association between the data and canonical pathways was determined by the ratio of the number of overlapping genes from our dataset to the total number of IPA dataset genes in a particular pathway, to determine the most significantly affected pathways. Fisher&#x2019;s exact test was used to determine the p-value of association between genes and the canonical pathway, where p &#x003C;0.05 was considered significant. Toxicity lists are generated based on sets of molecules that are known to be involved in a particular type of toxicity. IPA analyses were performed for the coexpression partners of each gene in the All Candidate Genes group (Supplemental Excel 3-5), and for each module from the WGCNA (Supplemental Excel 6). Over representation analysis (ORA) was performed on each WGCNA module using the CEMiTool package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and the Molecular Signatures Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> v7.1 (Supplemental Excel 7).</p>

<title>AF GWAS Loci SNPs</title>
<p>AF GWAS risk SNPs from two recently published meta-analyses were aggregated to create a comprehensive list of 166 SNPs: 142 risk variants were identified by Nielsen, et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, with an additional 24 independent risk variants identified by Roselli, et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The 166 SNPs were located in 135 distinct loci (Supplemental Excel 8). The locus with the most independent risk SNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> was at 4q25, near <italic>PITX2</italic>, which had 10; loci labelled <italic>SCN10A, SCN5A, KCNN3, NEURL1, RPL3L</italic>, and <italic>LINC01142</italic> each had 3; loci <italic>LRRC10, NKX2-5, ZFHX3, LINC00477, HSF2, NACA, AKAP6</italic>, RP11_380D231 (AC098798.1), <italic>FBXO32, MEX3C</italic> had 2.

<title>Genes Coexpressed with Each Candidate Gene</title>
<p>Of 233 candidate genes in the All Candidate Genes group, 5 AF candidate genes were not significantly expressed in our human adult LAA tissues (MIR6500, <italic>PANDAR</italic>, MIR54810, MIR548AZ, LOC101926943) and 3 (ENSG00000269728, ENSG00000255864, ENSG00000270028) were retired by Ensembl.</p>
<p>Coexpression partners of the remaining 228 AF candidate genes ranged from 0 to 1928 genes. C4orf32 had the highest number of coexpressed genes (1928 genes), followed by <italic>FXR2</italic>, which was significantly coexpressed with 1889 genes.</p>

<title>Top Canonical Pathways of Coexpressed Genes</title>
<p>IPA was used to identify top candidate pathways of each group of genome-wide coexpressed partners for each gene in the All Candidate Genes group (Supplemental Excel Folder10). After ranking IPA canonical pathways for each candidate gene by p-value, the top 5 significant canonical pathways were listed for each gene (Supplemental Excel 9). Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation, epithelial adherens junction signaling, sirtuin signaling pathway and actin cytoskeleton pathway were the most frequent pathways listed among the top 5 canonical pathways (Supplemental Excel 3). For the Any eQTL Genes group (Supplemental Excel 4), epithelial adherens junction signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation, germ cell-Sertoli cell junction signaling and axonal guidance signaling were the most frequent pathways listed. For the Top GWAS SNP eQTL Genes group (Supplemental Excel 5), EIF2 signaling, axonal guidance signaling, sertoli cell-sertoli cell junction signaling, regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial dysfunction were the most frequent pathways listed among the top 5 canonical pathways. Overall, the most frequent pathways were those involved in energy and metabolism signaling, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation, and sirtuin signaling.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Despite having identified over 135 genetic loci associated with AF from prior meta-analyses, establishing functional connections and causal genes contributing to AF pathophysiology remains challenging. Here we utilized human atrial eQTL analyses to identify top candidate causal AF genes. To advance our understanding of the biological mechanisms of these candidate genes, we identified gene coexpression partners for each candidate gene and WGCNA modules that inform functional characterization using pathway and gene set analyses. This application provides insight into the function of genes nearest the top AF GWAS loci, for example <italic>PITX2</italic> and <italic>ZFHX3</italic>, for which connections to AF mechanisms remain challenging.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>PITX2</title>
<p>The top locus implicated by AF risk GWAS is on chromosome 4q25. The nearest gene is <italic>PITX2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, which encodes a transcription factor that regulates left-right asymmetry during organ morphogenesis, suppresses a sinus node program in the LA, and is critical to formation of the pulmonary veins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, making it an attractive candidate causal gene. <italic>PITX2</italic> is active during cardiac development and decreases with maturation, likely contributing to our failure to identify significant eQTLs in our adult LAA tissues. Nevertheless, <italic>PITX2</italic> remains expressed in our adult LA tissues, though in lower levels in patients with AF,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> suggesting an additional function(s) in the adult LA. Top canonical pathways of genes coexpressed with <italic>PITX2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) include amino acid metabolism (e.g. alanine degradation, valine, 4-aminobutyrate and glutamine degradation, driven by <italic>ABAT</italic> and <italic>ALDH6A1</italic>), and major signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT, G protein coupled receptor signaling, IGF-1, PDGF signaling, renin-angiotensin and AMPK signaling pathways, all commonly mediated by the phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (<italic>PIK3R1</italic>), and also AMPK non-catalytic subunit &#x03B3; 2 (<italic>PRKAG2)</italic>. <italic>PIK3R1</italic> encodes for a subunit of PIK3, which is critical in insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and in the regulation of myogenic differentiation, myoblast proliferation, and myotube hypertrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is activated by insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> which is critical in regulation of energy metabolism in cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and decreases autophagy and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Inhibition of the PI3K-Akt signaling in the heart is thought to contribute to AF in patients on ibrutinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, an immunotherapeutic agent that acts as a Bruton&#x2019;s tyrosine kinase inhibitor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. PRKAG2 is one of three AMPK regulatory subunits, and is abundant in the heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. <italic>PRKAG2</italic> gain of function mutations increase AMPK activity and promote accumulation of glycogen in cardiac tissues via transcriptional changes in glucose handling regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. <italic>PRKAG2</italic> mutations are considered a metabolic storage disease and not a disease of the sarcomeres - this is further evidenced by the absence of fibrosis or myocyte disarray in patients with a mutation presenting with either hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and/or conduction abnormalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Increased AMPK activity and the resultant glycogen accumulation are also correlated with changes in metabolic pathways and AKT phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The AKT signaling pathway also regulates myocyte hypertrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that <italic>PITX2</italic> may play a role in metabolic energy utilization and/or regulation in the heart, and dysregulation may cause metabolic dysregulation and imbalance in autophagy, with subsequent disease.</p>
<p>IPA analysis also highlighted fibrotic signaling pathways, driven by transmembrane protein 67 (<italic>TMEM67)</italic>, cannabinoid receptor 1 <italic>(CNR1)</italic>, collagen type IV &#x03B1;2 chain <italic>(COL4A2)</italic>, insulin like growth factor binding protein 5 <italic>(IGFBP5)</italic>, adrenergic receptor &#x03B2;2 (<italic>ADRB2</italic>), plasminogen activator, urokinase <italic>(PLAU)</italic>, angiotensin I converting enzyme <italic>(ACE)</italic>, neurofibromin 1<italic>(NF)</italic>, and Xin actin binding repeat containing 1 <italic>(XIRP1)</italic>. AMPK activation inhibits Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) beta signaling and target transcripts of pathways associated with cardiac fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Although <italic>PITX2</italic> had no prior known role in fibrosis signaling, this network pattern suggests that <italic>PITX2</italic> may suppress general fibrosis and tissue remodeling pathways, perhaps by the AMPK pathway; <italic>PITX2</italic> loss of function may promote activation of fibrosis pathways, which may predispose to AF.</p>
<p><italic>PITX2</italic> is most strongly coexpressed with <italic>PITX2</italic> adjacent non-coding RNA (<italic>PANCR</italic>), which we reported is an upstream regulator of <italic>PITX2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.

<p>WGCNA analysis associates <italic>ZFHX3</italic> with module 2, which was overrepresented by AF risk genes.

<p>One of the most statistically significant modules with AF over representation is module 2. Heme metabolism is the hallmark pathway from GSEA for module 2. Iron deficiency is seen in patients with heart failure, and portends higher mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In contrast, iron overload can result in AF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Iron homeostasis affects mitochondrial function and ATP-linked respiration by modulating activity of electron train complexes I, II and III<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Respirometry studies from human LAA tissues of patients with AF and diabetes undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery also implicate impairment of Complexes I and II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. In rapidly paced cardiomyocytes, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to AF progression, mediated by activation of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. One of the top canonical pathways from IPA analysis of module 1 includes Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling. Oxidative stress activates PKA signaling in cardiac myocytes which triggers apoptosis and reduced mitochondrial respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. PKA activation indirectly inhibits mitochondrial fission and increases mitochondrial fusion, with resultant superoxide production and altered mitochondrial potential with increase in mitochondrial pore permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.

<p>These examples demonstrate how WGCNA modules and pathway analyses of coexpressed genes can help elucidate potential function of AF risk genes, including those for which mechanistic connections to the disease have remained poorly defined. Our overall findings are consistent with the two meta-analyses reported by Roselli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and Nielsen et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> but are also distinct from previous findings.

Nielsen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> noted cardiac structural remodeling as a recurrent theme and postulated that genes active during fetal heart development are reactivated in response to stress in the adult heart.

<title>Dual Risk Model for Development of AF</title>
<p>Differences between the All Candidate Genes group and the Any eQTL Genes group highlight the differing expression patterns that may be present in cardiac development compared to later in life, when AF typically presents. The All Candidate Genes group contains GWAS implicated genes active in development. The Any eQTL Genes group indicate genes that are active in adult LAA, whose expression may serve as a barometer of function in the adult atria. These findings support our proposed dual risk model for development of AF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. In this model, genes active during cardiac structural development contribute to genetic susceptibility to AF, for example potentially by alterations in pulmonary vein development (e.g. <italic>PITX2</italic>) that may contribute to pulmonary vein triggers. However, with exposure to stresses later in life, transcriptional responses to cellular stress, such as metabolic stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, sirtuin signaling and abnormal proteostasis may lead to altered, overwhelmed or reduced transcriptional responses, as suggested by our prior study of differential gene expression in AF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and the current analyses. Indeed, AF is associated with heterogeneous cardiovascular stressors, including aging, obesity, hypertension, coronary or valvular disease, heart failure, metabolic syndrome, sleep apnea, excessive alcohol, and extreme exertion. Thus, in genetically susceptible individuals, the imbalance in transcriptional responses to stress may predispose to AF occurring later in life. In addition, the imbalance or overcompensation during response to injury, initially adaptive, may eventually lead to fibrosis and adverse remodeling, with eventual presentation of the disease. This concept may explain why AF tends to occur later in life as evidenced by the top canonical pathways in this study, including pathways involved in mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation and sirtuin signaling. Metabolic stressors and pathways likely play a strong role in AF and suggest that AF occurrence may reflect crossing the threshold of cellular resilience and adaptation.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Studies</title>
<p>IPA was initially designed for use in cancer data sets and relies upon curated pathways, thus our results may be skewed by the composition of the pathways. Some of these pathways may not accurately reflect the pathology of cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, many of the top canonical pathways seem relevant to AF. Pathway analyses may oversimplify mechanisms. Functional studies, including overexpression and knockdown models, are required to establish causation. However, these analyses are intended to help guide such studies toward relevant candidate genes and pathways. Future studies are planned or underway for several of the targets identified. Our samples were from the LAA, rather than the PVs. However, PV tissue is difficult to obtain, and the LAA is directly adjacent to the left PVs and reflects atrial function in the human adult. The left atria obtained for this study were from patients that required open heart surgery, which suggests significant disease comorbidity. Here, we attempted to adjust for heterogeneity of comorbidities with use of surrogate variable adjustments.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conjunction with recent GWAS meta-analyses demonstrating 135 loci associated with risk for AF, our genetic-genomic analyses in human adult LA tissue have identified 233 candidate genes, of which 131 had significant eQTLs. Coexpression analyses of these gene sets identified stress pathways that are implicated in AF risk. These include mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, sirtuin signaling, EIF2 signaling, and protein ubiquitination pathways. WGCNA modules, and specifically those with AF candidate genes over representation, suggest remodeling in response to injury may be occurring through changes in metabolomics, myogenesis and apoptosis. We propose a dual risk model for AF, where genes active during cardiac development contribute to genetic susceptibility to AF, for example by alterations in PV development that leads to PV triggers. In genetically susceptible individuals, development of stresses later in life, such as those associated with aging or obesity, may lead to inadequate or overwhelmed transcriptional responses to stress that can predispose to AF. Here we also identify multiple genes not previously linked to AF. We have created a resource to help scientists elucidate possible functions of genes through identification of coexpressed genes with each candidate AF gene, and associated modules in the LAA via WGCNA. The components allow for better elucidation of likely AF mechanisms and potential targets for upstream therapies.</p>
