<meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Food insecurity is defined as the limited or uncertain availability of enough food for a consistently active and healthy life. COVID-19 is a highly transmissible viral infection with high mortality due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, or the uncommon severe pneumonia. This study assesses the relationship between food security and dietary patterns status with COVID-19 in the North Khorasan province, Iran.

Methods This case-control study will be conducted in the men and women aged 20-60 years improved from COVID-19 infection. The cases (n=124) and controls (n=124) were selected according to the eligibility criteria, including recently improved COVID-19 according to the positive COVID-19 PCR test. People referred to public and private laboratories or employees of public and private factories, offices, and departments of hospitals and universities (for the cases) and negative PCR tests without any clinical signs of COVID-19 infection (for the controls). The North Khorasan province was the target place. The groups are matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). The assessments will include anthropometric measurements and general demographic, USDA 18-item food security (18item-FSSM), and 147-item food frequency (FFQ) questionnaires. Finally, the determination of the relationship between food security and dietary patterns status and associated socioeconomic factors with COVID-19 is done. P-value will be &lt;0.05.

Discussion This study would be the first assessment of the relationship between food security and dietary patterns status with COVID-19 disease. It may help planners and policymakers to manage food insecurity and unhealthy dietary patterns and later increasing the immune system and decreasing the incidence of COVID-19. Further studies are suggested.

COVID-19 is a highly transmissible viral infection with high mortality due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, or the uncommon severe pneumonia. This study <kbd>assesses</kbd> the relationship between food security and dietary patterns status with COVID-19 in the North Khorasan province, Iran.</p></div><div id="sec-2" class="subsection"><p id="p-3"><strong>Methods</strong> This case-control study will be conducted in the men and women aged 20-60 years improved from COVID-19 infection. The cases (n=124) and controls (n=124) were selected according to the eligibility criteria, including recently improved COVID-19 according to the positive COVID-19 PCR test. People referred to public and private laboratories or employees of public and private factories, offices, and departments of hospitals and universities (for the cases) and negative PCR tests without any clinical signs of COVID-19 infection (for the controls). The North Khorasan province was the target place. The groups are matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). The assessments will include anthropometric measurements and general demographic, USDA 18-item food security (18item-FSSM), and 147-item food frequency (FFQ) questionnaires. Finally, the determination of the relationship between food security and dietary patterns status and associated socioeconomic factors with COVID-19 is done. P-value will be &lt;0.05.</p></div><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><p id="p-4"><strong>Discussion</strong> This study would be the first assessment of the relationship between food security and dietary patterns status with COVID-19 disease. It may help planners and policymakers to manage food insecurity and unhealthy dietary patterns and later increasing the immune system and decreasing the incidence of COVID-19. Further studies are suggested.</p></div></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-5">The authors have declared no competing interest.</p><h3>Funding Statement</h3><p id="p-6">Not applicable.</p><h3>Author Declarations</h3><p id="p-7">I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.</p><p id="p-8">Yes</p><p id="p-9">The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:</p><p id="p-10">All protocols used in this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (Ethical Code: IR.TBZMED.REC.1399.1053).</p><p id="p-11">I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.</p><p id="p-12">Yes</p><p id="p-13">I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
