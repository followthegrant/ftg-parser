<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely employed to study stroke pathophysiology. In particular, analyses of fMRI signals at rest were directed at quantifying the impact of stroke on spatial features of brain networks. However, brain networks have intrinsic time features that were, so far, disregarded in these analyses. In consequence, standard fMRI analysis failed to capture temporal imbalance resulting from stroke lesions, hence restricting their ability to reveal the interdependent pathological changes in structural and temporal network features following stroke. Here, we longitudinally analyzed hemodynamic-informed transient activity in a large cohort of stroke patients (n = 103) to assess spatial and temporal changes of brain networks after stroke. While large-scale spatial patterns of these networks were preserved after stroke, their durations were altered, with stroke subjects exhibiting a varied pattern of longer and shorter network activations compared to healthy individuals. These temporal alterations were associated with white matter damage and were behavior-specific. Specifically, restoration of healthy brain dynamics paralleled recovery of cognitive functions, but was not significantly correlated to motor recovery. These findings underscore the critical importance of network temporal properties in dissecting the pathophysiology of brain changes after stroke, thus shedding new light on the clinical potential of time-resolved methods for fMRI analysis.</p><sec>
<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Understanding the pathophysiology of a disorder is pivotal to design effective treatment. In this regard, recent advances in stroke research settled a new clinical concept: <italic>connectional diaschisis</italic>, which suggested that post-stroke impairments arise from both focal structural changes (tied to the injury) and widespread alterations in functional connectivity. fMRI time-resolved methods consider structural and temporal properties of brain networks as interdependent features. They are, thus, better suited to capture the intertwine between structural and functional changes. Here we leveraged a dynamic functional connectivity framework based on the clustering of hemodynamic-informed transients in a large and heterogeneous stroke population assessed longitudinally. We showed that lesions led to an unbalance in the brain dynamics that was associated with white matter fibers disruption and was restored as deficits recovered. Our work showed the potential of a time-resolved method to reveal clinically relevant dynamics of large-scale brain networks.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mammalian brain, even in the absence of explicit task, operates through the continuous integration and segregation of signals from different brain areas. Since the landmark work from Fox and colleagues in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) performed at rest has become one of the most prominent methods to investigate intrinsic brain activity and its relationship with behavior or psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). These task-free resting-state paradigms could potentially be advantageous to measure pathological brain changes, as they can be readily deployed, even with patients unable to match control performance due to motor and cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>)3/16/21 3:10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Analysis of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has so far mostly relied on measuring inter-regional (or voxel- or vertex-level) connectivity by means of Pearson correlation between time-series from a set of predefined regions of interest (a.k.a. <italic>static</italic> functional connectivity). In these studies, information exchange between neuronal populations of different regions is assumed to engender stronger statistical dependency stationary over time. Nevertheless, the human brain is a dynamic system that fluctuates at the time scale of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Therefore, <italic>static</italic> connectivity approaches, despite their methodological simplicity and ease, may miss features reflecting the inherent dynamic nature of the brain. In the last decade, several time-resolved approaches have thus been proposed to investigate the so-called <italic>dynamic</italic> functional connectivity (dFC) ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) for a review). They have been demonstrated to provide benefits over <italic>static</italic> methods, notably to study cognition and psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Besides, deeming non-stationarity enables a more accurate description of the modular interactions occurring between brain functional networks and their anatomical substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this potential, only a handful of studies have employed time-tailored methods to explore the neural correlates of stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), even though it is one of the major neurological disorders in Western societies and a leading cause of long-term disabilities. Ranging from motor to cognitive deficits, these disabilities arise from both focal structural changes (tied to the injury) and widespread functional alterations in inter-regional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), as theorized under the concept of <italic>connectional diaschisis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Structural and functional abnormalities combine in an interdependent manner to generate both deficits and recovery processes. Considering the complexity of these interactions, time-resolved FC approaches, which spatial <italic>and</italic> temporal properties of brain networks, could help unravel the intertwine between structural disruptions and lesion-induced dynamic changes in large-scale functional networks. Coupled to behavioral and clinical assessments, these methods could further elucidate the nature of pathological changes occurring after stroke, possibly supporting our understanding of recovery processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we leveraged a recent dynamic FC framework, i.e., the innovation-driven coactivation patterns (iCAP) framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), to investigate whether spatial and temporal properties of large-scale brain networks following stroke correlate with anatomical damage and behavioral recovery. We applied the iCAP framework to an extensive dataset (n = 103) of stroke patients scanned at different points in time after-lesion (i.e., 1-2 weeks, 3 months and 1 year) and with different neurological syndromes (i.e., ranging from motor to cognitive deficits). While the spatial patterns of the obtained large-scale functional brain networks were preserved after stroke, lesions disrupted their temporal durations, emphasizing the prospects of exploiting time-resolved fMRI methods. Importantly, these altered durations were <italic>i)</italic> proportional to the percentage of disrupted white matter fibers; <italic>ii)</italic> specific to the neuropsychological deficit; iii) correlated with functional improvements; and <italic>iv)</italic> restored over time proportionally to the recovery of deficits.</p>
<p>This is the first time that a time-resolved approach is deployed in a large cohort of stroke patients, which were evaluated longitudinally with a comprehensive set of multi-domain clinical assessments. Using the iCAP framework, we revealed important aspects of post-lesional reorganization of functional dynamics, in relation to anatomy and to behavioral changes. We posit that understanding the nature of this relationship is pivotal to grasp the multifaceted reorganization mechanisms that occur following stroke, and that are directly involved in recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>

<title>Lesion topography and behavioral profile of patients</title>
<p>We studied a large population of stroke patients and age-matched healthy subjects (i.e., in total 267 acquisitions, <bold>Table S1</bold>). Briefly, first-time stroke patients with clinical evidence of impairment were recorded longitudinally: 1-2 weeks (n = 103), 3 months (n = 72), and 12 months (n = 54) after the lesion. The healthy control group (n = 19) also underwent two imaging sessions at a distance of 3 months. Lesion volume varied greatly over patients (ranging from 0.1 cm<sup>3</sup> to 277.02 cm<sup>3</sup>, mean &#x00B1; SD volume: 33.66 cm<sup>3</sup> &#x00B1; 49.51 cm<sup>3</sup>), with the highest overlap found in white matter and subcortical regions (<bold>Figure S1a</bold>). Specifically, the most affected tracts were the corticospinal tract, the fronto- and parieto-pontine tract, the extreme Capsule (EMC), and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) (<bold>Figure S1b-c</bold>). Prior to each fMRI scan, patients were tested with an exhaustive neurobehavioral battery. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) on these behavioral data to isolate clusters of deficits for each domain separately (e.g., motor, language, attention, spatial memory, and verbal memory) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We found factors analogous to our previous works (see <bold>SI</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>)) and also similar recovery effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Indeed, patients with severe acute deficits (i.e., &#x003E; 2 SD from healthy subjects at 1-2 weeks post-lesion) recovered mostly within the first three months post-lesion (<bold>Figure S1d</bold>). Instead, patients with less severe acute deficits (i.e., &#x003C; 2 SD from healthy subjects) had stable performances over sessions comparable to those of the healthy subjects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Whole brain dynamics is preserved in patients</title>
<p>We applied Total Activation on the denoised BOLD time courses to retrieve robust transient activity (i.e., frames with highly changing activity, the so-called significant innovation frames), individually for the 267 acquisitions considered (<bold>Figure S2</bold>). Patients and healthy subjects had a comparable number of transients (mean &#x00B1; SD - healthy controls: 43.8 &#x00B1; 12.0; patients 1-2 weeks: 45.8 &#x00B1; 22.4; 3 months: 43.4 &#x00B1; 19.5; 1 year: 43.7 &#x00B1; 20.4, expressed in percentage of the total number of frames for each subject - <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref></bold>), highlighting that the whole brain overall amount of dynamic fluctuations was preserved after stroke. Yet, dynamics of specific brain regions could still be affected by the lesion. For this reason, we then extracted spatial patterns of large-scale networks and we computed dynamic features for each network individually.</p>

<title>Resting-state activity can be decomposed into spatial maps corresponding to known functional networks</title>
<p>Transients of both healthy subjects and patients at different time points were fed to a k-means clustering to obtain stable innovation-driven co-activation patterns (iCAPs), which could be spatially and temporally overlapping. The number of clusters was determined using evidence accumulation and, as a result, 16 iCAPs were extracted (<bold>Figure S3a</bold>). The iCAPs corresponded to well-known resting-state networks, in line with our previous results in different datasets (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold> and <bold>Table S2</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Specifically, they included sensory-related networks such as primary and secondary visual areas (iCAP 6), auditory and language network (iCAP 5), with high activations in Heschl gyrus and rolandic operculum, and sensorimotor network (iCAPs 3 and 8), which included pre-, post-, and para-central areas, supplementary motor area, and middle cingulum (only for iCAP 3). Two iCAPs (1 and 11) represented the visuospatial/ventral attention network and comprised the primary (iCAP 1) and secondary (iCAP 11) visual areas along with the precuneus. There was an additional task-related iCAP, the fronto-parietal network (iCAP 4), with high activations in the frontal and parietal lobes together with anterior and middle cingulate cortex (ACC and MCC). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), the Default Mode Network (DMN) was decomposed into a frontal part (iCAP 12) including frontal lobe and ACC, and a posterior part (iCAP 10) comprising the cuneus, the precuneus, and the superior and inferior parietal lobes. Four iCAPs included regions of the cerebellum (iCAPs 2, 7, 13, and 16). Yet, iCAPs 13 and 16 were specific to the anterior (iCAP 13) and posterior cerebellum (iCAP 16); whereas iCAP 2 included as well secondary visual areas and iCAP 7 hippocampal areas. The remaining iCAPs comprised regions of the salience network, with iCAP 15 encompassing middle and superior frontal lobe and ACC, and iCAP 9 related to the inferior temporal lobe, the hippocampus and the amygdala.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>iCAP spatial maps are similar between patients and controls</title>
<p>Prior to evaluating differences between patients and healthy controls, we first assessed between-session spatial replicability of the iCAPs in healthy subjects. The high similarity of the spatial patterns (mean cosine similarity over iCAPs &#x00B1; SD: 0.95 &#x00B1; 0.02 <bold>Figure S4a</bold>) emphasized the ability of the iCAP framework to extract reliable and stable networks. Interestingly, spatial maps were also very similar between patients and healthy controls (mean cosine similarity over iCAPs &#x00B1; SD at 2 weeks: 0.97 &#x00B1; 0.03; 3 months: 0.97 &#x00B1; 0.02; 1 year: 0.97 &#x00B1; 0.01 - <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref></bold> and <bold>Figure S4b</bold>), as previously reported using static functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Finally, spatial maps were also highly comparable between left and right damage patients (<bold>Figure S4c</bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Patients exhibited a varied pattern of longer and shorter resting-state network activations</title>
<p>The stability of the spatial maps over sessions (<bold>Figure S4a-c</bold>) and groups (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref></bold>) highlighted the robustness of the brain&#x2019;s functional architecture, as described using iCAPs. We capitalized on this observation to investigate the temporal properties associated with these large-scale brain networks. To this end, we used spatiotemporal transient-informed regression to derive iCAP time courses at the subject-level and to compute the average duration of each iCAP. Similarly to our assessment of spatial replicability, we evaluated between-session temporal replicability in the healthy subjects. Given the stability of average iCAP durations in the healthy control group (p &#x003E; 0.31 - Bonferroni-Holm FWE corrected; see <bold>Figure S4d</bold>), we then probed whether this temporal measure could be leveraged as a discriminative feature to distinguish stroke patients and healthy subjects. Considering that patients present with a combination of deficits in different domains, which may reflect dysfunction across multiple brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), we opted for a multivariate approach, which considers a combination of multiple features instead of individual networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Specifically, after selecting the six most stable iCAPs over folds of patients and healthy subjects using a two-sample Mann-Whitney test, we performed a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) that allowed to discriminate between the two groups with a significant accuracy (0.66 &#x00B1; 0.04 - p &#x003C; 0.02), as illustrated by a diagonal confusion matrix (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref></bold>), and sensitivity-specificity, as emphasized by the area-under the curve (AUC: 0.63 &#x2013; null distribution threshold: 0.60). LDA weights were highly stable over cross-validation folds (mean absolute z-score &#x00B1; SD over iCAPs: 15.49 &#x00B1; 6.46) and captured specific regions whose temporal profiles were affected in stroke patients. In particular, patients showed a longer duration in pre-central areas, anterior and medium cingulum, and superior temporal lobe. Instead, the occipital lobe, inferior temporal lobe and the postero-lateral cerebellum had a reduced duration (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b-c</xref></bold>). A similar varied pattern of longer and shorter network activations was observed when comparing individual iCAP durations between healthy controls and stroke patients at different point in time after lesion (<bold>Figure S4e</bold>).</p>

<title>Changes in duration are associated with behavioral deficits and recovery</title>
<p>We then assessed whether changes in iCAP durations correlated with clinical impairments and recovery, as estimated using the behavioral measures. We applied a second PLSC analysis, this time between the temporal measures and the behavioral data of the three time points, separately for each domain. Functional network durations showed significant correlations with recovery from attention, language, and spatial memory deficits (attention: p-value = 0.03, &#x03C1; = 0.23; language: p-value = 0.003, &#x03C1; = 0.18; spatial memory: p-value = 0.007, &#x03C1; = 0.18), but not from motor or verbal memory impairments (p-value &#x003E; 0.12). This observation parallels previous findings regarding the relationship between brain modularity and behavior, in which a reduction in modularity was observed in the sub-acute stage, followed by a partial recovery, limited to attention, language and spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). To further explore the clinical relevance of our results, we first investigated the saliences related to the behavioral data. We observed that they were only significant for patients with severe acute deficits, which were the ones showing the largest recovery over time (<bold>Figure S1d</bold>). We then investigated the saliences pertaining to iCAP durations and highlighted that temporal patterns were behavior-specific (mean correlation &#x00B1; SD over behaviors: 0.22 &#x00B1; 0.08, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref></bold>). Indeed, attention domain had saliences in the fronto-parietal network, the amygdala, the precuneus and the visual cortex. Spatial memory symptoms, instead, were mostly correlating with fronto-parietal and sensorimotor networks, the posterior part of the cerebellum, the amygdala, and the visual cortex. Finally, language-related deficits were specifically tied to the language network and primary and secondary visual areas. In order to probe the temporal evolution of these brain functional components, we then projected the individual subject&#x2019;s iCAP durations onto the significant multivariate brain saliences for healthy controls and for patients with severe acute deficits (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref></bold>). Over time, the brain scores of stroke patients approached those of healthy controls, suggesting that post-stroke network dynamics restored proportionally to behavioral improvement.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In recent years, <italic>dynamic</italic> functional connectivity methods demonstrated to provide additional insights into the rich spatiotemporal orchestration of spontaneous fluctuations as compared to <italic>static</italic> approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), in particular for psychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). However, the transition towards dFC in the context of stroke has so far remained limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). While existing studies provided compelling evidence in favor of a dynamic reconfiguration of brain networks following stroke, they relied on small sample sizes and focused solely on specific neurological symptoms, limiting the generalizability of their findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Besides, they relied on <italic>a priori</italic> selection of brain regions, which limits the identification of alternative areas that may be recruited into a network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), and on time-windowed estimates, which confine the investigation to slow changes in connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Here, we aimed to overcome these limitations by using a state-of-the-art data-driven dynamic method, the iCAP framework, which uses single frames to reveal large-scale brain networks that can be spatially and temporally overlapping. This method proved to be successful in disentangling the spatiotemporal organization of brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) and spinal cord activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) in able-bodied subjects. Deploying it in an extensive cohort of stroke patients (n = 103) with heterogeneous neurological syndromes and scanned longitudinally, we uncovered a temporal imbalance of network recruitment compared to healthy controls and showed how these dynamic changes articulate with anatomical and behavioral disruptions.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Delving into network dynamics</title>
<p>We deployed the iCAP framework and found sixteen large-scale brain networks, or iCAPs, whose spatial patterns were in agreement with previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). This spatial organization was robust in healthy subjects and in stroke patients, with similar patterns in the two populations. In particular, networks were bilateral regardless of the side of the lesion, suggesting a preserved organization across brain regions. While this might seem in contradiction with the decrease in interhemispheric connectivity previously reported post-stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), it should be noted that fine-grained coordination between brain areas can be occulted when using classical <italic>static</italic> FC approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). For instance, the correlation between distinct brain areas exhibiting both positive and negative correlations in distinct time-windows would result in a low <italic>static</italic> functional connectivity, in spite of the dynamic synchronization existing between these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Therefore, it follows that a decrease in FC does not necessarily imply a decrease in global network activity. However, decreased FC might reflect an overall reduction in the efficiency of information transfer, which could manifest in the form of aberrant durations of functional networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate these time-varying properties, we thus derived subject-specific iCAP time-courses and computed average durations of activation for each individual iCAP, a measure that cannot be explained in terms of <italic>static</italic> connectivity. Of note, a similar approach previously allowed to show the link between brain dynamics and risk factors for schizophrenia in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). In our study, network durations were stable over time in healthy subjects, while durations were, in contrast, affected post-stroke. Specifically, patients exhibited a varied pattern of longer and shorter network activations alluding to an &#x201C;under-engagement&#x201D; in certain brain states coupled with an &#x201C;over-engagement&#x201D; in others. These results, combined with the preserved overall amount of dynamic fluctuations (i.e., similar number of significant innovation frames between patients and healthy subjects), hint at a dynamical imbalance following stroke, rather than an overall shift towards a slower or a faster brain activity. A compelling observation was that networks usually associated in static analyses, such as the two sensorimotor networks (iCAPs 3 and 8) presented opposite engaging behaviors after lesions. This suggests that intricate and non-stationary behavior are also present within overlapping brain regions, something that would be overlooked when relying on conventional <italic>static</italic> methods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Structural substrates of disrupted dynamics</title>
<p>We then assessed whether this post-stroke imbalance was determined by structural damages. Indeed, understanding how the human brain orchestrates large-scale functional networks despite being constrained by a rigid anatomical substrate and how this orchestration is affected by lesions is still an open question in clinical neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). For this, we related iCAP temporal properties to structural measures of disconnections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) and found that altered durations were explained by the disruption of white matter tracts, particularly within the projection pathways, as well as within the cingulum and the commissural pathways. The former subserve the subcortical integration of sensorimotor inputs and outputs between the cerebral cortex and the peripheral system. The latter, instead, connect cerebral hemispheres. Both these pathways are involved in providing local and global efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), measures that are indicative of the capacity for parallel information transfer and integrated processing between, respectively, short and long distance regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). As such, disruptions of these tracts likely drive the widespread neurobiological processes occurring in the course of stroke recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Domain-specific behavioral correlates</title>
<p>Finally, we assessed whether these lesion-induced changes in network dynamics correlate with behavioral impairments and recovery. To this end, we capitalized on the longitudinal nature of the dataset so as to assess short- and long-term recovery processes and on its multi-domain clinical assessments. Earlier observations indicated that most deficits restore within three months, with additional recovery, yet more limited, up to one year following lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Interestingly, these multi-scale recovery patterns were reflected in the temporal dynamics of brain activity, as the initial imbalance observed in severely affected patients normalized towards the level of healthy subjects, mostly within the first three months. Thanks to the heterogeneous patient population, we showed that these trends were significant only for attention, language and spatial memory disorders, as also observed for post-stroke decrease in network modularity in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). This suggests that both modularity and network duration are associated with higher cognitive deficits, in the form of functional changes likely reflecting inter-hemispheric homotopic integration and within-hemisphere segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). It is noteworthy that these alterations in static connectivity were not reflected in the spatial organization of the large-scale networks but on their temporal durations. Motor deficits, instead, are known to be better predicted by lesion location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), probably indicating that these functions rely less on information integration between large-scale networks. Further supporting the differential nature of impairments, changes in duration were network-specific (e.g., only durations of auditory and visual networks correlated with language deficits). Finally, deficits and recovery were associated with distant brain regions, bringing new evidence to corroborate that stroke is not a focal disease but, instead, a network disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Clinical considerations</title>
<p>In summary, we found that durations of large-scale resting-state networks was altered in consequence of interruptions in white-matter tracts. The brain was, therefore, less resilient and modular after stroke, as previously hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Importantly, the restoration of the networks&#x2019; natural temporal properties, likely accompanied by a restoration of this resilience, was crucial to achieve behavioral recovery, especially for cognitive deficits. Altogether, these results underscore the clinical relevance of network temporal properties, in particular as regards their duration. Therefore, dynamic functional connectivity methods seem crucial not only to elucidate pathophysiology changes post-stroke but also to capture potential therapeutic targets that could possibly be modulated, for instance using non-invasive brain stimulation. While such interventions have been frequently employed to improve motor recovery after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), only a restricted number of attempts have explored brain stimulation to treat post-stroke cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), despite several successful applications in psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). In this field, recent investigations jointly considering anatomy and functional dynamics provided valuable insights to guide neuromodulation treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). In this regard, we foresee that investigating stroke-related disruptions using dynamic approaches could help shed light on meaningful temporal properties, which are directly tied to the underlying anatomical substrate, and that can be more readily leveraged to tune neuromodulation parameters. Considering that brain stimulation approaches can change excitability of functional connections within and between cortical areas with a high temporal and topographical resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), tuning parameters based on temporal properties could enable a better modulation of large-scale brain networks with the aim to improve patient&#x2019;s clinical outcome. In this context, the advent of multimodal recording and stimulation techniques such as TMS-fMRI is critical to first probe the effects of brain modulation over network dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), so that stimulation paradigms can be tuned accordingly. Finally, it is noteworthy that dFC methods do not require additional acquisition constraints for the patients. As such, clinical transitions to fMRI time-resolved methods appears not only necessary but also technologically possible.</p>

Individual tissue (white and gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) maps were segmented from the T1 image. Then, the first ten functional scans were discarded, resulting in T = 118 volumes per run (for a total of 826 volumes per subject &#x2013; i.e., 118 &#x00D7; 7 runs). The following sources of spurious variance were regressed out from these BOLD time series: (i) six parameters obtained by rigid body correction of head motion, (ii) average white matter and CSF signals.

We first applied the Total Activation framework (TA, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>)), which applies hemodynamically informed deconvolution to the pre-processed fMRI time series (native space) of each run separately to reliably retrieve activity-inducing signals. Then, for each subject and session, activity-inducing time courses of all runs were concatenated, removing three volumes at each intersect (i.e., 808 volume kept in total per subject and session) and significant activation change-points (i.e., transients) were computed as the temporal derivative of these activity-inducing signals. Transients were then normalized to the MNI space considering the lesion mask as a prior for an additional tissue class in the segmentation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), concatenated across all subjects (i.e., patients and healthy subjects &#x2013; see <bold>SI</bold> for subjects excluded from the analysis) and sessions, and fed into a temporal k-means clustering to obtain large-scale resting-state networks, the iCAPs. The optimum number of 16 clusters was determined by evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) (<bold>Figure S3a</bold> and <bold>SI</bold>).

<title>Group comparisons of iCAP durations</title>
<p>In order to compare iCAP durations between patients and healthy control subjects, we deployed a Bayesian classifier, specifically a LDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). We built a two-class LDA classifier (accounting for different covariance matrices for each class) using the durations of the 16 iCAPs. To rank the features of the classifier, we calculated the discrimination power for the two classes (i.e., patients and healthy controls) for each feature separately, using a two-sample Mann-Whitney test. We performed leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, leaving out, for each fold, all the sessions of one subject (either healthy control or patient) and we ranked the features by their absolute standardized u-statistic obtained from the Mann-Whitney test. We selected the features that were stable over folds (i.e., the features that were always ranked as most discriminative, n = 6) and used them to build an LDA classifier. Decoding accuracy values were averaged over leave-one-out cross-validation folds. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and confusion matrices were computed considering all folds and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was computed. To assess the statistical significance of the classification, we built N=1000 classifiers with randomly assigned labels at each permutation and estimated AUC and classification accuracy for each permutation.

However, white matter disconnections were obtained only from structural images obtained at 1-2 weeks post-lesion. Therefore, for the PLSC we considered brain and anatomical data only for this first time point. Our assumption was further justified by non-significant correlation components for later time points.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>we computed a group PLSC analysis between the 16 iCAP durations and the behavioral scores for three groups: patients without severe acute deficits, patients with severe acute deficits, and healthy controls as normative data. PLSC analysis was computed for each neuropsychological domain (attention, spatial memory, verbal memory, language, and motor) separately, as only a limited number of participants performed the assessment for all four classes (<bold>Table S1</bold>). Behavioral scores were obtained from the first PCA component. In order to capture multivariate patterns of correlation with the behavioral measures and the recovery, for each subject and each time point the behavioral design matrix included <italic>(i)</italic> a variable containing the average value of the behavioral score over all subject&#x2019;s time points (mean), <italic>(ii)</italic> a variable containing the difference between the behavioral score at that time point and the average value over all time points (delta), and (iii) a variable for the mean by delta interaction.</p></list-item>
