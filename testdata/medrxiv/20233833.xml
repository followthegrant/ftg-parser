<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The aim of this population-based work was to evaluate the impact of having had cancer on COVID-19 risk and prognosis during the first wave of the pandemic (27 February &#x2013; 13 May 2020) in Reggio Emilia Province. Prevalent cancer cases diagnosed between 1996 and 2020 were linked with the provincial COVID-19 surveillance system. We compared cancer survivors&#x2019; cumulative incidence of being tested, testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, and dying of COVID-19 with that of the general population; among COVID-19 patients, we compared cancer survivors&#x2019; risk of dying with that of other patients.</p><p>During the study period 15,391 people (1,525 cancer survivors - CS) underwent RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 4,541 (449 CS) tested positive; 549 (114 CS) died of COVID-19. The probability of undergoing testing was 29.5&#x0025; in the general population as well in CS, while the cumulative incidence of being tested, testing positive, and COVID-19 death were lower in CS: age- and sex-adjusted Incidence Rate Ratios were 0.69 [95&#x0025;CI 0.65-0.73], 0.55 [95&#x0025;CI 0.50-0.61], and 0.52 [95&#x0025;CI 0.42-0.64], respectively. Cancer survivors had worse prognosis when diagnosed with COVID-19, particularly those below the age of 70 (odds ratio (OR) of death 4.91 [95&#x0025;CI 2.38-10.09]), while the OR decreased after age 80 (1.20 [95&#x0025;CI 0.87-1.65]). The OR was higher for patients with a recent diagnosis (&#x003C;2 years OR=2.99 [95&#x0025;CI 1.52-5.89]) or metastases (OR=2.14 [95&#x0025;CI 0.89-5.16]).</p><p>Cancer patients may have adopted behaviors that protected them from infection, but they were still at higher risk of death once infected.</p><sec>
<title>Novelty and impact</title>
<p>Cancer survivors during the first wave of the pandemic showed lower COVID-19 cumulative incidence and mortality. When infected, they had worse prognosis, particularly in people younger than age 70, with a recent diagnosis, or with metastases.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) has become a worldwide threat, and the related disease, COVID-19, is the major healthcare concern of the year 2020. After China, Italy was one of the first countries that experienced a tragic increase in the incidence of and mortality for COVID-19, with more than 232,000 cases and over 33,000 deaths by the end of May 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first Chinese study, on a very small group of 18 patients, showed that cancer patients presented a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a higher risk of requiring mechanical ventilation or ICU (Intensive Care Unit) admission compared to the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Further studies have found that COVID-19 patients with cancer tend to have much more severe symptoms and a nearly 3-fold higher death rate than COVID-19 patients without cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Especially patients with hematologic, lung, and metastatic cancers demonstrated higher rates of severe events compared with patients without cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> In addition, patients who underwent cancer surgery and contracted SARS-CoV-2 showed higher death rates and higher chances of having critical symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Thus, several authors have suggested that immunosuppressed status (whether caused by the disease itself or the treatment) of some cancer patients increases their risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and of worse outcomes compared with the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>With more than 18 million new cases per year globally, cancer affects a significant portion of the population. In Italy, over 377,000 new cases of cancer are estimated to occur in 2020, with an estimate of about 3.6 million cancer survivors; this prevalence is estimated to increase dramatically in the next few years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of having had cancer on COVID-19 risk and prognosis in an Italian province with a high incidence rate of tumors and which also saw a high cumulative incidence of COVID-19 between late February and early May 2020. To reach this aim we compared the risk of undergoing a SARS-CoV-19 test, testing positive, being hospitalized, and dying of COVID-19 of people diagnosed with cancer in the previous 25 years with the same risks of the general population. We also compared cancer survivors&#x2019; risk of dying of COVID-19 with that of other COVID-19 patients.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>This is a population-based cohort study using registry data of the Reggio Emilia Province. The study was approved by the Area Vasta Emilia Nord Ethics Committee on 7 April 2020, protocol n.2020/0045199.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>Reggio Emilia is a province in northern Italy with about 532,000 inhabitants. The Local Health Authority, the local public entity of the Italian National Health Service, provides hospital, outpatient, primary, and preventive care to the entire population residing in the province.</p>
<p>With the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in northern Italy, the following measures were adopted in the Province of Reggio Emilia: on February 22, schools were closed and social restrictions were imposed; on 8 March, mobility restrictions were imposed, and on 11 March, only essential services were permitted to remain open. During this phase, all cases with suspicious symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea) were tested. The first case of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) in the province was diagnosed on February 27, 2020.</p>
<p>The period of recruitment of patients involved in the study was from 22 February to 13 May 2020. Up to May 13, there were more than 4500 confirmed cases in the province; the epidemic was still spreading, but at a slower rate, and cumulative incidence reached about 9 per 1000.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>This study analyzed the variables of the residents in the Reggio Emilia Province who underwent the molecular test for COVID-19 between 27 February and 13 May 2020.</p>
<p>Then, information on COVID-19-positive and cancer patients was linked. A COVID-19 patient was diagnosed based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal specimens according to WHO indications; a cancer patient, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, was defined if that patient was in the Reggio Emilia Cancer Registry (RE-CR) archive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Data sources</title>
<p>The Reggio Emilia Cancer Registry registers all new cancer diagnoses occurring in people residing in the Reggio Emilia Province. The main information sources of the RE-CR are the anatomic pathology reports, the hospital discharge records, and mortality data. The RE-CR, which covers all the resident population in the Province of Reggio Emilia, has been active since 2000 and has registered all incident cases from 1996 to 2019, with active follow up for deaths and residence of all prevalent cases updated to 31/12/2019. It collects information on site, morphology, partial staging (presence of metastases), mode of diagnosis, and survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>All RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests performed in Italy must be recorded in the national case-based integrated COVID-19 surveillance system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> This surveillance system contains data on all COVID-19 patients, collected by the Public Health Department of the Local Health Authority during epidemiologic investigations, through: 1) daily reports from COVID-19 labs for all positive RT-PCR tests; 2) an initial epidemiologic investigation conducted through phone interviews with all cases, followed by daily phone calls to patients cared for in outpatient settings, both carried out by the Public Health Department of each Local Health Authority; 3) daily reports extracted from electronic medical records for hospitalized patients; 4) check of death records to assess mortality, particularly in outpatient settings.</p>
<p>The whole list of cases tested for COVID-19 (positive and negative) was linked with the entire archive of prevalent cases of malignant cancer on 31 December 2019 present in the RE-CR database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Outcome measures</title>
<p>From the COVID-19 surveillance system data, we report the cumulative incidence of: a) being tested for SARS-CoV-2; b) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (for the COVID-19 definition adopted by the Italian Ministry of Health, these are all COVID-19 cases); c) people hospitalized while SARS-CoV-2 positive; d) people dying while SARS-CoV-2 positive. Follow up was closed on 13 May 2020.</p>
<p>Based on the data collected by the Reggio Emilia Cancer Registry, all the tested subjects were grouped according to their oncological history: patients who had never been diagnosed with a malignancy <italic>versus</italic> patients with a clinical history of malignancy at any time since 1996. Cancer patients were then categorized according to the time since cancer diagnosis (&#x003C; 2 years, 2-5 years, and &#x003E; 5 years), cancer site, and presence of metastases at diagnosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Pearson&#x2019;s chi-square test was used to examine differences in the proportions of subjects with and without cancer and tested/not tested for SARS-CoV-2. We report age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratios, with relative 95&#x0025; confidence intervals (95&#x0025; CI) using Poisson regression, for cumulative incidences. The outcomes of interest for this analysis were: cancer survivors&#x2019; being tested for SARS-CoV-2, having a positive test, being hospitalized, and dying of COVID-19, compared with the same outcomes of those who had never had a cancer diagnosis. Multivariate analysis was performed using a logistic regression model to measure the odd ratios, with relative 95&#x0025; CI, of hospitalization and death for COVID-19 patients with cancer, adjusting for age and sex. STATA v.14.1 (StataCorp LP 4905 Lakeway Drive, Texas 77845 USA) was used for all analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>On 31 December 2019, there were 43,716 residents of the Province of Reggio Emilia still alive after a cancer diagnosis (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers), for a prevalence of 8.9&#x0025;. Between 27 February and 13 May 2020, 15,391 residents in the Province of Reggio Emilia underwent molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 (2.9&#x0025; of the resident population); testing was more frequent among the elderly and among females; 1,525 cancer survivors underwent testing (3.5&#x0025; of total cancer survivors) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The age- and sex-adjusted cumulative incidence ratio was 0.69 (95&#x0025; CI = 0.65, 0.73) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

Patients with cancer underwent less self-isolation (47.4&#x0025; vs 69.8&#x0025;) but were more often hospitalized (52.6&#x0025; vs 30.2&#x0025;) and died (25.4&#x0025; vs 10.6&#x0025;) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).

<p>The multivariate analysis (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) showed that among COVID-19 patients, females had a lower risk of being hospitalized and of dying (OR 0.61, 95&#x0025; CI = 0.56, 0.66 and 0.62, 95&#x0025; CI = 0.54, 0.71, respectively). People ages 70-79 had the highest probability of being hospitalized, while those &#x003C; age 70 had the lowest. The probability of death increased with age, with ORs for those below age 70 compared to those over 79 of 0.06 (95&#x0025; CI = 0.04, 0.06) and for age 70-79 vs over 79 of 0.49 (95&#x0025; CI = 0.41, 0.59). We observed a strong interaction between age and cancer in the effect on fatality rate and, to a lesser degree, also for hospitalization. The OR of being hospitalized for COVID-19 among those below age 70 with a previous diagnosis of cancer was 2.52 (95&#x0025; CI = 1.76, 3.62) and among those over 79, 1.51 (95&#x0025; CI = 1.10, 2.07). The OR of dying was 4.91 (95&#x0025; CI = 2.38, 10.09) for patients below age 70 and 1.20 (95&#x0025; CI = 0.87, 1.65) for patients over age 79.</p>

<p>Excess mortality in cancer patients was higher in the presence of metastases, but differences could be due to chance (OR 2.14, 95&#x0025; CI = 0.89, 5.16) (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Concerning timing, the probability of death was higher for all patients with cancer, but the strongest excess was for cancers diagnosed less than two years before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms (OR 2.99; 95&#x0025; CI = 1.52, 5.89). The patterns were similar for hospitalization: among the 449 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with cancer, the sites most frequently affected were breast (101 cases), digestive organs (86 cases, of which 48 colon, 20 rectum, 13 stomach, 4 pancreas, 1 biliary tract), urinary tract (57 of which: 41 bladder, 14 kidney, 2 upper urinary tract), and male genital organs (56 cases, of which 52 prostate, 3 testis, and 1 penis). COVID-19 patients with lymphomas, other hematological organs, respiratory organs, female genital organs, or urinary tract showed the greatest excess of hospitalizations; other hematological organs, melanoma, and female genital organs showed the strongest excess mortality.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths were more frequent among cancer patients than in the general population. However, when considering the different age structure of cancer survivors, the adjusted cumulative incidence was about 45&#x0025; lower in people with cancer, as was hospitalization and mortality. Differences in cumulative incidence were not likely due to differences in testing, since the cumulative probability of being tested was only 30&#x0025; lower for people with cancer and the probability of testing positive was almost identical in the two populations. This suggests that the criteria for referring to testing identified targets with similar probabilities of disease, regardless of the presence of a previous diagnosis of cancer.</p>
<p>Once having COVID-19, the probability of being hospitalized and of dying was much higher for people with a previous diagnosis of cancer that were below the age of 70 at the time of infection; excess mortality was appreciable only up to the age of 80, while after 80 the excess was largely compatible with random fluctuation. For hospitalization, the excess decreased, though it remained appreciable in all age groups.</p>
<p>Higher fatality and hospitalization rates for COVID-19 patients with a previous diagnosis of cancer have been observed in several studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, including a recent large registry-based Italian study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Instead, we did not find any studies comparing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 death in cancer survivors with that in the general population. Only a few case series tried to infer the risk of infection, comparing the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients with that in health care providers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> or with that in the general population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> or comparing the prevalence of cancer among COVID-19 patients with that in the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> These studies gave inconsistent results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The observed lower probability of being tested and of testing positive could be related to protective behaviours adopted early by people with previous cancer, i.e. social distancing and wearing masks. It must be taken into consideration that the Italian Government implemented special protection measures for people with chronic diseases, including cancer, such as exemption from any work not allowing social distancing.</p>
<p>While age is a powerful risk factor for death, we observed fewer hospitalizations for the age group &#x2265; 80 than in the age group 70-80. The observed excess in mortality among the elderly is consistent with all previous studies both in the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and in cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Hospitalization rates may have been influenced by the availability of beds during the epidemic peak and also by the context; as many patients over age 80 were already assisted in nursing homes, there was no need for hospitalization in some cases.</p>
<p>The effect of sex is also consistent with all previous studies, showing more severe disease in males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the proportion of people with a previous cancer diagnosis among COVID-19 patients (about 9&#x0025;, in our province) was much higher than that reported in other studies from China, ranging between 2.7&#x0025;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and 1&#x0025;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our cohort of COVID-19 patients, a previous diagnosis of cancer increased the risk of death up to the age of 80, after which the impact of having had a cancer was modest or null. A systematic review including about 50,000 COVID-19 patients found exactly the same phenomenon: the impact of previous cancer on survival was important before the age of 65 but was almost null in the elderly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> This has also been observed for the impact of all comorbidities on COVID-19 survival, which decreases as age increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is worth noting that the excess risk of death and hospitalization was stronger in patients with a recent diagnosis of cancer and in patients with metastases at diagnosis. This is consistent with the findings of Liang and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> who found an excess only in patients who recently received treatment, and with the results of Dai and colleagues, who reported an excess for patients who had a diagnosis of stage IV cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Data from a large cohort of patients with active cancer and COVID-19 in the UK did not confirm an excess risk due to recently undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy compared to patients that did not. The excess risk of those with metastases, however, was confirmed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, it remains unclear whether the increased risk of death was due to the direct effects of cancer or to treatment (surgery and chemotherapy). However, our data plus insights from other studies suggest that the magnitude of the effect on COVID-19 prognosis is greater during the active phase of cancer, after which the impact decreases.</p>
<p>In our study the most represented cancer sites among COVID-19 patients were breast, digestive tract, urinary tract, and male genital organs; less frequent were thyroid, hematologic, female genital organs, melanoma, respiratory organs, lymphoma, head neck, and other sites. In studies from China,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> the most frequent cancer sites among COVID-19 patients were lung and digestive tract, while breast was not as frequent as in Italy. These differences reflect the prevalence of these neoplasms in our province, compared with that in the Chinese population.</p>
<p>The strongest excess of death was observed in patients with cancer of the female genital organs, urinary tract, other hematologic organs, and thyroid, while for cancer of the respiratory organs and lymphomas, we observed a considerable excess of hospitalizations but a just a small excess of deaths. It is not easy to compare our results with those of other studies because most included only hospitalized patients; if the risk of hospitalization does not reflect that of death, relative risk among hospitalized patients is affected by a collider bias. Nevertheless, our data are not consistent with those of the large UK cohort, where small excess risk was observed for lymphoma and respiratory cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>These results make it difficult to put together a profile of patients at higher risk of dying of COVID-19 based on cancer site and phase of care, for whom particular measures, including delaying treatments, could be taken to reduce the risk of infection, as suggested by some authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> The only feature that clearly emerged was recent diagnosis and the presence of metastases.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that public awareness and measures allowing cancer survivors to reduce their risk of infection did reduce the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and related deaths. This is an important message for the policy makers, physicians, and patients that are trying to define how to better manage patients during this crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main strength of this study is its population-based design, which eliminates any selection bias occurring in case series. Furthermore, the assessment of exposure, i.e. previous diagnosis of cancer, was conducted through the linkage with a cancer registry with 25 years of prevalence data and timely registration of incident cases (to 31 December 2019). It is worth noting that this information was acquired before the onset of the pandemic and is thus completely independent of outcome occurrence. The main limitation of our study is that we do not have any information on treatment or on comorbidities, which could have influenced outcomes. Furthermore, because we could not include cancer patients with a diagnosis occurring in 2020, we could not observe the phase of diagnosis and disease assessment, which for many cancer sites is very intensive in terms of access to healthcare facilities.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our population-based study showed that during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in northern Italy, cancer survivors had lower cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and related hospitalizations and death. Among COVID-19 patients, the cancer survivors had a higher risk of hospitalization and of death especially in the age group &#x003C; 70, those with metastatic cancers, or with a recent diagnosis.</p>
