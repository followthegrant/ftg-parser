<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p>In the wake of the rapid surge in the Covid-19 infected cases seen in Southern and West-Central USA in the period of June-July 2020, there is an urgent need to develop robust, data-driven models to quantify the effect which early reopening had on the infected case count increase. In particular, it is imperative to address the question: How many infected cases could have been prevented, had the worst affected states not reopened early? To address this question, we have developed a novel Covid-19 model by augmenting the classical SIR epidemiological model with a neural network module. The model decomposes the contribution of quarantine strength to the infection timeseries, allowing us to quantify the role of quarantine control and the associated reopening policies in the US states which showed a major surge in infections. We show that the upsurge in the infected cases seen in these states is strongly co-related with a drop in the quarantine/lockdown strength diagnosed by our model. Further, our results demonstrate that in the event of a stricter lockdown without early reopening, the number of active infected cases recorded on 14 July could have been reduced by more than 40&#x0025; in all states considered, with the actual number of infections reduced being more than 100, 000 for the states of Florida and Texas. As we continue our fight against Covid-19, our proposed model can be used as a valuable asset to simulate the effect of several reopening strategies on the infected count evolution; for any region under consideration.</p>

<title>BACKGROUND</title>
<p>The Coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 originating from the virus &#x201C;SARS-CoV-2&#x201D;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> has led to a global pandemic, leading to more than 50 million confirmed global cases in more than 200 countries as of November 13, 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> In the United States, the first infections were detected in Washington State as early as January 20, 2020,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and now it is being reported that the virus had been circulating undetected in New York City as early as mid-February.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> As of September 21, 2020, the United States has &#x2248; 6.9 million infected cases since the virus began to spread.</p>
<p>Since the second week of June, a second surge of Covid-19 was seen in the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> with rapidly increasing daily infected cases, hospitalization rates and death rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> Initially driven by disastrous situations in the states of Arizona, South Carolina, Texas, Florida and Georgia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> the surge in cases was also later seen in several other Southern and West-Central states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> This surge can be seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref> which shows the active infected cases over time as of July 14, 2020 with a 7-day moving average for 9 states. States which reopened early show a generally strong co-relation with the rise in the infected cases over the 3-month period from late April to mid July 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> For example, states which opened before May 15 showed daily infected case increments of: Florida (1393 &#x0025;), Arizona (858 &#x0025;), South Carolina (999 &#x0025;), Alabama (547 &#x0025;), Oklahoma (477 &#x0025;), Tennessee (279 &#x0025;), Georgia (245 &#x0025;), Mississippi (215 &#x0025;), Nevada (697 &#x0025;), Texas (680 &#x0025;) and Utah (287 &#x0025;); while states which reopened after May 29 showed values of: Michigan (16 &#x0025;), Pennsylvania (&#x2013;26 &#x0025;), New York (&#x2212;52 &#x0025;), New Jersey (&#x2212;32 &#x0025;) and Illinois (&#x2212; 54 &#x0025;). Thus, although early reopening seems to be co-related to the second surge of cases seen in the USA, there is a need for robust, data-driven quantification of the effect of early reopening on the growth of infected count data. More importantly, it is of utmost importance to answer the question: How many infected cases could have been prevented, had the worst affected states not reopened early?</p>

</fig>
<p>In an effort to address this question, we have developed a machine learning-aided epidemiological model. The novelty of our model arises from the fact that it allows us to decompose the contribution of quarantine/lockdown strength evolution to the infected data timeseries for the region under consideration. This enables us to simulate the effect of varying quarantine strength evolutions and hence varying reopening strategies on the infected count data. We define reopening as beginning when a state allows its stay-at-home order to expire, or, in the case of states that never issued a stay-at-home order, when a state first starts allowing non-essential businesses, such as dine-in restaurants and hair salons, to reopen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> The reopening details for the states considered in the study are shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Considering nine US states which showed a significant surge in cases since the last month, we demonstrate that our model shows a drop in the quarantine strength evolution when these states were reopened. Furthermore, we show that maintaining a strict lockdown without early reopening would have led to about 500, 000 fewer infected cases in all these states combined.</p>

<title>QSIR model: ODE formulation</title>
<p>The QSIR ODE model formulation is similar to the one studied previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and is briefly explained in this section. The equations governing the QSIR model are as follows

<p>The SIR model is augmented by introducing a time varying quarantine strength rate term <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) represented by a neural network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and a quarantined population <italic>T</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), which is prevented from having any further contact with the susceptible population. Thus, the term <italic>I</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) denotes the active infected population (Actively infected = Cumulative infected - Recovered) still having contact with the susceptibles, as done in the standard SIR model, while the term <italic>T</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) denotes the infected population who are effectively quarantined and isolated.</p>

<title>Augmented QSIR Model: Parameter estimation</title>
<p>The data for the infected, recovered case counts was obtained from the publicly maintained repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at John Hopkins University. The loss function is defined as
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="20242172v2_eqn8.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Parameter optimization for <italic>W, &#x03B2;, &#x03B3;, &#x03B4;</italic> was performed by minimizing the loss function defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">Equation 8</xref> using the approach employed in prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> using an ADAM optimizer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> with a learning rate of 0.01. For most of the states under consideration, <italic>W, &#x03B2;, &#x03B3;, &#x03B4;</italic> were optimized by minimizing the loss function given in (8). For states with a low recovered count: Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Texas, we employed a two stage optimization procedure to find the optimal <italic>W, &#x03B2;, &#x03B3;, &#x03B4;</italic>. In the first stage, (8) was minimized. For the second stage, we fix the optimal <italic>&#x03B3;, &#x03B4;</italic> found in the first stage to optimize for the remaining parameters: <italic>W, &#x03B2;</italic> based on the loss function defined just on the infected count as <italic>L</italic>(<italic>W, &#x03B2;</italic>) = &#x2225;log(<italic>I</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) &#x002B; <italic>T</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) &#x2212;log<italic>I</italic><sub>data</sub>(<italic>t</italic>))&#x2225;<sup>2</sup>. Such an approach was found to be optimal for analyzing low recovered count data in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In all states considered in the present study, we trained the model using data starting from the dates when the 500<sup>th</sup> infection was recorded in each region and up to July 14, 2020. For each state considered, <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) denotes the rate at which infected persons are effectively quarantined and isolated from the remaining population, and thus gives composite information about (a) the effective testing rate of the infected population as the disease progresses and (b) the intensity of the enforced quarantine as a function of time.</p>
<p>This QSIR ODE framework applied on the infected and recovered data is used to estimate the quarantine strength function Q(t) in a particular state as shown in the first and second columns of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>.</p>

<title>QSIR Model: SDE formulation</title>
<p>The ODE modelling framework described above is a deterministic approach to model transfer of species (here: people) from one compartment to another through different reaction channels. Such a deterministic approach ignores any random fluctuations during species transfer from one compartment to the other. To include such stochastic effects and thus get a measure of the model uncertainty, we note that the augmented SIR framework derives from the chemical master equation which descibes the time evolution of the probability of such a system of interacting species to be in a given state at a given time (details in Supplementary Information). Although the chemical master equation cannot be solved analytically, under certain conditions, it can be distilled down to a stochastic differential equation (SDE) which captures the fluctuations in species transfer as random walks. Such an SDE, also known as the Chemical Langevin Equation, is thus based on the underlying ODE framework (macroscopic picture) and also includes stochastic effects reminiscent of microscopic modelling. In fact, in the Supplementary Information, we show that the microscopic simulation, macroscopic ODE formulation and the Chemical Langevin Equation (which acts as a bridge between the two) are all equivalent to each other.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>The first stage of our analysis is using our model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> called the QSIR model to diagnose the underlying quarantine strength evolution <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) in the regions under consideration. By applying the QSIR model to more than 70 countries globally, we have established the validity of <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) in accurately diagnosing the on-the-ground quarantine situation in majorly affected European, South American and Asian countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> A slow growth of <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) without a significant increase indicates relaxed quarantine policies, a sharp transition point in <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is indicative of a sudden ramp-up of quarantine measures, and an inflection point corresponds to the time when the quarantine response was the most rapid in the region under consideration. The results of our model applied globally to all continents are hosted publicly at covid19ml.org.</p>
<p>In this study, to perform the quarantine diagnosis to analyze the implications of delayed reopening, we applied the QSIR model to 9 US states which showed a significant surge in the infected case count in the last month: Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows representative results for Arizona, Nevada, South Carolina and Tennessee. The plots for the remaining states are provided in the Supplementary Information. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3 a, d, g, j</xref> show the comparison of the infected and recovered count estimated by our model with the actual data. A reasonable agreement is seen for all states, with the model being able to capture the rise in infections seen in the tail end of the timeseries. The QSIR model details are provided in the Methods section; Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values for the model along with the epochs required for convergence for each state are provided in Supplementary Information.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3 b, e, h, k</xref> show the quarantine strength evolution <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) as learnt by the neural network module, which shows a decline whose starting point corresponds well to the time when these states began reopening, as seen from <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> and the green dotted line in the <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figures 3 b, e, h, k</xref>. In some states, the decline in <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) starts later than the reopening date; possibly corresponding to the Phase 2 or Phase 3 of reopening (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) or because of the time delay for population level changes to be seen in the infected count evolution, after reopening. <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) trained by our model shows a significant drop after early reopening in all Southern and West-Central states that showed a surge in cases last month; whereas the North-Eastern states of New York, New Jersey and Illinois, which reopened late and showed no surge in infections, did not show a drop in <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and figures in Supplementary Information). Thus, the upsurge in the infected cases seen in these states is strongly co-related with a drop in the quarantine/lockdown strength <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) diagnosed by our model. This is indicative of two things: (a) the Southern and West-Central states reopened early, which led to a relaxed imposition of quarantine/lockdown measures in these states and consequently a surge in infections was seen, and (b) the North-Eastern states of New York, New Jersey and Illinois reopened late, and even after reopening, a relatively low contact rate was maintained amongst the population, leading to a relatively high magnitude of the imposed quarantine strength, which prevented a surge of infections in these states.</p>

<p>After confirming that our model is able to accurately depict the co-relation between the surge in infections and early reopening in these states through the diagnosed <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), we proceed to the second in stage of our analysis. In the second stage, we use the diagnosed <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) to address the question: How many infected cases would have been reduced, had the worst affected states not reopened early? To answer this question, we simulate the &#x201C;no-reopening&#x201D; strategy by assuming that <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is maintained at the value it was before reopening, without decreasing. This simulated <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3 b, e, h, k</xref>. The flexibility of our model allows us to run our model with this simulated <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) for all states considered. To quantify the aleatory uncertainty resulting from random fluctuations in the model, we utilized the chemical Langevin equation extension to the QSIR model whose definition and justification is described in the Methods and Supplemental Information section. This allows us to estimate bootstrapped confidence intervals resulting from 1000 simulations of such a stochastic model, and thus quantify the effect of such a &#x201C;no-reopening policy&#x201D; on the epidemic spread. The infected count evolution for the simulated <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) without reopening is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3 c, f, i, l</xref> (5&#x0025; and 95&#x0025; quantiles are shown). We can see that, for all these states, instead of seeing a spike in infections, we would have seen a plateau in the infected case count evolution. The number and the percentage of infected cases that would have been prevented by July 14 had these states not reopened are shown in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. It is evident that the number of infections could have been reduced by more than 40&#x0025; in all states considered, with the actual number of infections reduced being more than 100, 000 for the states of Florida and Texas. Even the less populated states of Louisiana, South Carolina and Tennessee show mean infected case reduction values of 44&#x0025;, 84&#x0025; and 47&#x0025; respectively, which correspond to 36, 000, 51, 000, and 31, 000 infected cases reduced.</p>

<title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>In this study, we have developed a novel methodology to quantify the effect of early reopening on the infected case count surge seen during the period of June-July 2020. We have proposed a machine learning model, called the QSIR model, rooted firmly in fundamental epidemiology principles which has the following attributes: (a) it is highly interpretable with few free parameters rooted in an epidemiological model, (b) it relies on only Covid-19 data and not on previous epidemics and (c) it can decompose the infected timeseries data to reveal the quarantine strength/policy variation, <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), in the region under consideration. To demonstrate the validity of our model in capturing the actual quarantine policy evolution in a particular region, the model has been applied to 70 countries globally. The quarantine strength behaviour learnt from the model accurately mimics the on-the-ground situation in majorly affected European, South American and Asian continents. The results for this global analysis are hosted at covid19ml.org.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>After confirming our belief in the model through a global analysis, we apply the model to the Southern and West-Central US states which have shown a massive surge in Covid-19 infected cases since June 2020. We demonstrate that the <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) extracted by our model shows a significant drop in value for the Southern and West-Central states which reopened early and showed a surge in infections. The time at which <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) starts to decline generally agrees well with the reopening date for the states considered. Since the decline in <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is strongly co-related to the surge of infections and also the reopening date for states which reopened early, we can then simulate the effect of &#x201C;no-reopening&#x201D; by maintaining the <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) at a constant level after reopening, instead of declining. We show that maintaining a steady imposition of quarantine/lockdown control would have played a massive role in bringing down the infected count by more than 40&#x0025; in all states considered, with the infections reduced reaching more than 100, 000 for the states of Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>We have proposed a novel machine learning methodology, rooted in fundamental epidemiological models; which is able to recover the real time quarantine strength evolution for any region under consideration. As the pandemic evolves and we continue our fight against Covid-19; and for future outbreaks, our globally applicable methodology can be a valuable asset for researchers and policy makers to simulate several reopening strategies, counterfactual scenarios and analyze their impact on the infected count evolution. Our findings highlight that as we continue the fight against Covid-19, it is imperative to reduce the contact between susceptible and infected individuals in public places by formulating robust safety guidelines. Such guidelines implemented and maintained in the affected states would ensure a high level of quarantine strength associated with that state and can prevent a future surge or wave in the Covid-19 infected count timeseries.</p>
<p>Validation of the model robustness and parameter identifiability have been mentioned in the Supplementary Information. We have also compared an equivalent of the effective reproduction number called the Covid spread parameter in our study, with other studies to further validate the results of our modelling approach. The Covid spread parameter is defined by (a) the infected individuals and (b) the recovered individuals from both the infected and the quarantined states; since both of those effectively don&#x2019;t further contribute to the infection spread.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results of our model should be taken in the context of its assumptions. Ideally, one needs to consider the shifting US testing policies for the time period under consideration. Since the testing efforts did not show a significant increase during and after the reopening in the US states in the time period considered within the present study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and we did not want to burden our model with additional parameters to fit; testing compartments have not been included in the present study. Additionally, several studies in literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> have attempted to incorporate underreporting of infected/recovered cases in their modelling paradigm. Most of these studies use previously known estimates of testing data, serology data or Infection-Fatality-Rate(IFR). In these studies involving multiple parameters, a number of parameters are assumed to fixed at the start of the simulation from prior studies. These parameters include and are not limited to: time between onset of infections and symptoms, transmission duration, rate at which hospitalized patients recover,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> mean duration from symptom onset to recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> or even the IFR ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> A second class of studies uses antibody testing from collected serum samples to estimate the actual number of infected cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the pandemic unfolds and starts spreading, the first information available is the number of infected, recovered and deaths (for example: the John Hopkins public repository for Covid-19 tracking). Unless we have serum sample data information or we can confidently rely on prior studies for assessment of certain parameters, accurate information of the underreporting factor is difficult to obtain in real time. One of the goals of the present modelling methodology is to assist researchers and policy makers with quarantine diagnosis information in real time, with no reliance on parameters derived from prior studies.</p>
<p>Finally, the model is based on the SIR framework, which assumes a constant, age-independent contact and recovery rate between the infected and susceptible populations. Additionally, we do not consider the spatial heterogeneity in the infected count within a particular state and assume the governing dynamics to be only time-dependent. Consideration of these second-order aspects would further refine the model and would be the subject of future studies.</p>

This corresponds well to the delayed reopening and generally stronger quarantine measures employed in the North-Eastern US states.

The difference in these results between the North-Eastern and Southern, West-Central states indicates two things: (a) it strengthens the validity of our proposed model in capturing the real-time reopening scenario in different states through the evolution of the diagnosed <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), and, more importantly, (b) it further validates the role played by early reopening in reducing <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and subsequently leading to a surge of new infected cases in the Southern and West-Central US states.</p>

<p>In order to validate the robustness of the model and the uniqueness of the parameters recovered by the model, we consider a Gaussian Process residue model for uncertainty quantification. Gaussian Processes have emerged as a useful tool for regression, classification, clustering and uncertainty quantification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, we fit a Gaussian Process regression model between the error resulting from the best fit model and the infected data. For the prior over the function space, we use a mean of zero and variance described by a Squared Exponential Kernel with a lengthscale of 1 and a significantly high signal standard deviation of <italic>O</italic>(10<sup>4</sup>) which allows for noisy estimates of the posterior. Such a fitted model for the infected count for a region under consideration (Arizona), is shown below in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">figure 8</xref>. Subsequently, we sample 500 error residues from this model and superimpose them on the best fit predictions to simulate 500 samples of the infected case count data. Finally, we apply our model described on these 500 samples of data, and recover the parameters <italic>Q</italic> (<italic>t</italic>), <italic>&#x03B2;, &#x03B3;, &#x03B4;</italic> from each of them.</p>

This further validates the robustness of the model for other regions considered and strengthens the uniqueness of the parameters recovered by the model. A total of 12 million iterations (60000 iterations for each realization of the Gaussian process residue model &#x00D7; 500 realizations) were performed on the MIT Supercloud cluster to generate parameter histograms for each state considered.</p>

<title>Model validation: Calculation of the effective reproduction number</title>
<p>Following a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> we define the Covid spread parameter as follows:
<disp-formula id="eqn34">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="20242172v2_eqn34.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the susceptible population and <italic>N</italic> is the total population. This definition of the Covid spread parameter <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is equivalent to the effective reproduction number <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) in the context of the QSIR model. We included both <italic>&#x03B3;, &#x03B4;</italic> in the definition of <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) since both these parameters eventually contribute to the recovered population and we wanted to include effects of both. Another viable option to define <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) could be to just use <italic>&#x03B3;</italic> in the denominator of <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref> shows the comparison of the Covid spread parameter, as defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn34">Equation 34</xref> with and without reopening for all US states considered in the present study. For all the states, we can see that without reopening, a diminished effective reproduction number is seen, indicating moving in the right direction of halting the infection spread.</p>

<p>To further validate the Covid spread parameter variation and its relation to the effective reproduction number, we compare the variation in <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> to the <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub> obtained through a prominent Covid-19 forecasting model used by the CDC, USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> For all of the 9 states which we considered, the time at which an upsurge is seen in <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> due to early reopening corresponds very well to the exact time at which an upsurge is seen in <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub> .<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> In addition, we show the comparison between <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> values estimated from our study and <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>eff</italic></sub> values obtained from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> from reopening till one month post that; in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref>.
