<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We evaluated diagnostic accuracy of the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs in adult admissions who met the COVID-19 case definition at a busy acute hospital in the UK. We found the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test had a good specificity in patients with symptoms of COVID-19 presenting to hospital. The Innova LFA can be used to rapidly identify COVID-19 cases amongst hospital admissions meeting the COVID-19 case definition, allowing patients to be allocated to COVID-19 cohort areas.</p>

<title>Text</title>
<p>The scale-up of SARS-CoV-2 antigen lateral flow assays (LFAs) has caused much controversy, with concerns about lower sensitivity in asymptomatic individuals and when assays are performed by operators without healthcare training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> The proposed benefits of SARS-CoV-2 antigen LFAs are high specificity, fast turnaround times for results (under 30 minutes) and ease of scalability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> These assays are of potential utility for rapidly identifying SARS-CoV-2 in patients who fit the COVID-19 case definition and require hospital admission as prompt isolation prevents nosocomial transmission. Isolation rooms are often limited and capacity easily overwhelmed, necessitating the cohorting of patients with proven COVID-19. Even using rapid platforms, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR turnaround times are often too slow to inform patient placement from emergency departments (EDs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> SARS-CoV-2 LFAs could help improve flow of patients from the ED into &#x2018;COVID-19 positive&#x2019; cohorts and reduce pressure on limited hospital isolation rooms. However, little data exists on their diagnostic accuracy in this setting.</p>
<p>We therefore evaluated diagnostic accuracy of the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test (Lotus Global Company, London, UK) compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) in adult admissions who met the COVID-19 case definition at a busy acute hospital in the UK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> The Innova LFA was performed as per the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions by appropriately trained health-care assistants in the ED. A second NPS was simultaneously sent for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Between the 17<sup>th</sup> November 2020 and 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020, 728 patients presenting to the ED met the COVID-19 case definition and had valid Innova LFA and RT-PCR results. Baseline characteristics are shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>. 55&#x00B7;1% were male and median age was 67&#x00B7;5 years. 264 patients tested positive by Innova LFA. Those testing positive were younger (median age 65 vs 71, p=0.038), more unwell (NEWS of 5 vs 3, p&#x003C;0.001) and more often febrile on arrival (Temperature &#x003E;38&#x00B0;C in 41&#x00B7;9% vs 15&#x00B7;8%, p&#x003C;0.001) than those with negative LFA results. Overall, admission SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive in 38&#x00B7;5% (280/728).</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 1:</label>
<caption><title>Baseline Characteristics and Diagnostic Performance</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="21250428v1_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR as the reference standard, the Innova LFA had sensitivity of 86&#x00B7;4% (242/280, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 81&#x00B7;9-90&#x00B7;0) and specificity of 95&#x00B7;1% (426/448, 95%CI 92&#x00B7;6-96&#x00B7;7) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1B</xref>). 22/448 (4&#x00B7;9%) patients with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on admission had a positive LFA. 8 of these 22 patients reported a positive COVID-19 test result up to 14 days prior to admission and 5/22 subsequently had a positive PCR result within 5 days of admission. 13/22 had chest radiograph features consistent with &#x2018;classic/probable COVID-19&#x2019; as reported by a radiologist. Only 5/22 patients had no PCR or radiological evidence of COVID-19. 1/5 patients reported a confirmed household contact and only 2/5 left hospital with a diagnosis other than COVID-19. This suggests the lower than expected specificity of Innova LFA is likely to be a result of an imperfect reference standard, and specificity would be higher if using a clinical and RT-PCR based composite reference standard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>38 patients had negative Innova LFAs but positive PCR results. 20/38 had cycle threshold (Ct) values available, with median Ct values of 29 (IQR 27-35). Innova LFA results were available a median 3&#x00B7;2 hours after arrival (IQR 2&#x00B7;0-4&#x00B7;3, n=681) compared to 13&#x00B7;8 hours (IQR 9&#x00B7;9-18&#x00B7;2, n=679) for RT-PCR. 57&#x00B7;1% (n=35) had chest radiographs which were reported as typical for COVID-19. Of those with symptom duration recorded, 77.3% (17/22) were symptomatic for at least 7 days prior to attending the ED.</p>
<p>Accounting for the inadequacy of a single SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR as a reference standard, we found the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test had good specificity in patients with symptoms of COVID-19 presenting to hospital. Sensitivity in this setting was high (86.4%) when compared to pre-clinical evaluation studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Furthermore, results were mostly available within a few hours of presentation, allowing transfer of patients to COVID-19 cohort areas and reducing demand for isolation rooms whilst awaiting PCR results. Placing patients in the &#x2018;right bed&#x2019; first-time is also likely to reduce delays in care and increase efficiency, and allows isolation rooms to be prioritised for individuals requiring admission with suspected COVID-19 but negative LFA results. Of the 38 patients with COVID-19 (based on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR) who were &#x2018;missed&#x2019; by the Innova LFA, median Ct values were reasonably high, and correspond to viral loads associated with lower sensitivity in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> However, sensitivity of the Innova LFA appears lower than some other SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen LFAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> Importantly, individuals requiring admission with suspected COVID-19 should not be moved out of isolation on the basis of a negative SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen LFA results.</p>
<p>In summary, the Innova LFA can be used to rapidly identify COVID-19 cases amongst hospital admissions meeting the COVID-19 case definition with good diagnostic accuracy, and rapidly identify patients that can be allocated to COVID-19 cohort areas. Based on these data, this application of COVID-19 LFAs has now been recommended by NHS England.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
