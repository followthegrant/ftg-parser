<meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Epidemiological trends for major causes of death and disability, such as stroke, may be monitored using administrative data to guide public health initiatives and service delivery.

Methods We calculated admissions rates for ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage or subarachnoid haemorrhage between January 1, 2005 and December 31st, 2013 and rates of 30-day mortality and 365-day mortality in 30-day survivors to December 31st 2014 for patients aged 15 years or older from New South Wales, Australia (population 7.99 million). Annual Average Percentage Change in rates was estimated using negative binomial regression.

Results Of 81,703 eligible admissions, 64,047 (78.4%) were ischaemic strokes and 13,302 (16.3%) and 4,778 (5.8%) were intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhages, respectively. Intracerebral haemorrhage admissions significantly declined by an average of 2.2% annually (95% Confidence Interval=-3.5% to -0.9%) (p&lt;0.001). Thirty-day mortality rates significantly declined for ischaemic stroke (Average Percentage Change -2.9%, 95% Confidence Interval=-5.2% to -1.0%) (p=0.004) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (Average Percentage Change=-2.6%, 95% Confidence Interval=-4.8% to -0.2%) (p=0.04). Mortality at 365-days amongst 30-day survivors of ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage was stable over time and increased in 30-day survivors of subarachnoid haemorrhage (Annual Percentage Change 6.2%, 95% Confidence Interval=-0.1% to 12.8%), although the increase was not statistically significant (p=0.05).

Conclusion Improved prevention may have underpinned declining intracerebral haemorrhage rates while gains in survival suggest that innovations in stroke care are being successfully translated. Longer-term mortality in patients surviving the acute period is unchanged and may be increasing for subarachnoid haemorrhage warranting investment in post-discharge care and secondary prevention.

Annual Average Percentage Change in rates was estimated using negative binomial regression.

Results Of 81,703 eligible admissions, 64,047 (78.4%) were ischaemic strokes and 13,302 (16.3%) and 4,778 (5.8%) were intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhages, respectively. Intracerebral haemorrhage admissions significantly declined by an average of 2.2% annually (95% Confidence Interval=-3.5% to -0.9%) (p&lt;0.001). Thirty-day mortality rates significantly declined for ischaemic stroke (Average Percentage Change -2.9%, 95% Confidence Interval=-5.2% to -1.0%) (p=0.004) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (Average Percentage Change=-2.6%, 95% Confidence Interval=-4.8% to -0.2%) (p=0.04). Mortality at 365-days amongst 30-day survivors of ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage was stable over time and increased in 30-day survivors of subarachnoid haemorrhage (Annual Percentage Change 6.2%, 95% Confidence Interval=-0.1% to 12.8%), although the increase was not statistically significant (p=0.05).

Conclusion Improved prevention may have underpinned declining intracerebral haemorrhage rates while gains in survival suggest that innovations in stroke care are being successfully translated. Longer-term mortality in patients surviving the acute period is unchanged and may be increasing for subarachnoid haemorrhage warranting investment in post-discharge care and secondary prevention.

### Competing Interest Statement

John Worthington serves as a Board Member, NSW Ministry of Health, Bureau of Health Information (unpaid position). The Bureau of Health Information utilises linked and unlinked routinely collected health data to evaluate patient outcomes in NSW hospitals, including stroke. JW was a paid consultant for the Agency for Clinical Innovation, NSW Ministry of Health (2014-2016) to lead a project to reduce unwarranted clinical variation in stroke across the NSW Health Service.

### Funding Statement

New South Wales Ministry of Health, Office for Health and Medical Research, New South Wales Neurological Conditions Translational Research Grants Program.

Annual Average Percentage Change in rates was estimated using negative binomial regression.</p></div><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><p id="p-4"><strong>Results</strong> Of 81,703 eligible admissions, 64,047 (78.4%) were ischaemic strokes and 13,302 (16.3%) and 4,778 (5.8%) were intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhages, respectively. Intracerebral haemorrhage admissions significantly declined by an average of 2.2% annually (95% Confidence Interval=-3.5% to -0.9%) (p&lt;0.001). Thirty-day mortality rates significantly declined for ischaemic stroke (Average Percentage Change -2.9%, 95% Confidence Interval=-5.2% to -1.0%) (p=0.004) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (Average Percentage Change=-2.6%, 95% Confidence Interval=-4.8% to -0.2%) (p=0.04). Mortality at 365-days amongst 30-day survivors of ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage was stable over time and increased in 30-day survivors of subarachnoid haemorrhage (Annual Percentage Change 6.2%, 95% Confidence Interval=-0.1% to 12.8%), although the increase was not statistically significant (p=0.05).</p></div><div id="sec-4" class="subsection"><p id="p-5"><strong>Conclusion</strong> Improved prevention may have underpinned declining intracerebral haemorrhage rates while gains in survival suggest that innovations in stroke care are being successfully translated. Longer-term mortality in patients surviving the acute period is unchanged and may be increasing for subarachnoid haemorrhage warranting investment in post-discharge care and secondary prevention.</p></div></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-6">John Worthington serves as a Board Member, NSW Ministry of Health, Bureau of Health Information (unpaid position).
