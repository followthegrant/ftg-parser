<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection (CDI) is an important cause of nosocomial diarrhea. Given the discrepancy in current treatment guidelines for mild CDI, we sought to evaluate the use of first-line vancomycin for the treatment of non-severe infection.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all adult inpatients with first episode CDI at our institution from January 2013 to May 2018. CDI was defined as a positive C. difficile loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay, in conjunction with &#x2265;3 type 5&#x2013;7 stools on the Bristol stool scale. To evaluate the impact of first-line vancomycin treatment on adverse clinical outcomes in patients with first episode non-severe CDI, the initial vancomycin vs. initial metronidazole cohorts were first examined in an unadjusted logistic regression analysis for any combination of relapse, recurrence, and all-cause 30-day mortality, followed by an adjusted multivariable analysis.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 737 cases were included. Patients had a median age of 72.3 years (Q1: 61.2, Q3: 83.3) and 628 (85.2&#x0025;) were classified as non-severe CDI. Among patients with non-severe CDI (n = 628), relapse, recurrence, and mortality rates were 17.4&#x0025;, 7.0&#x0025;, and 11.4&#x0025;, respectively, when treated with initial metronidazole, compared to 18.6&#x0025;, 3.1&#x0025;, and 7.8&#x0025;, respectively, when treated with initial vancomycin. In an adjusted multivariable analysis, the use of first-line vancomycin for the treatment of non-severe CDI was associated with a reduction in recurrence or 30-day mortality (OR<sub>adj</sub>: 0.51; 95&#x0025;CI: 0.28&#x2013;0.94; P=0.03).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Initial vancomycin was associated with reduced recurrence or all-cause 30-day mortality in the treatment of adult inpatients with first episode non-severe CDI. Our findings support the use of initial vancomycin for all <italic>C. difficile</italic> inpatients, irrespective of disease severity, as recommended by Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.</p></sec>

<sec id="s1">
<title>Background</title>
<p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection (CDI) manifests itself in patients with an altered gut microbiota, and is commonly caused by exposure to antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. As the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea, CDI continues to be a major burden within healthcare institutions and in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Patients with CDI suffer from copious amounts of uncontrolled diarrhea, leading to a higher risk of life-threatening colitis and a lower quality of life. Despite undergoing lengthy courses of antimicrobial therapy, however, relapse is common, with approximately 20&#x0025; of patients experiencing debilitating episodes of repeated disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Recurrent CDI is associated with a greater risk for future recurrence and severe complications such as hypotension, perforation, and toxic megacolon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Therefore, early interventions aimed at preventing recurrent CDI are needed to improve outcomes, decrease the number of patient-days spent in isolation, and improve quality of life.</p>
<p>St. Joseph&#x2019;s Healthcare Hamilton is a multi-site teaching hospital located in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada with a dedicated <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> consultation service for inpatients and referred outpatients. While the consultation team may offer fecal microbiota transplantation to patients with multiple CDI episodes or refractory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], clinical interventions for first episode CDI primarily involve the use of antibiotics. In the past, metronidazole was indicated for non-severe CDI at our institution, while vancomycin was reserved for febrile patients with elevated white counts or for recurrent episodes. In recent years, however, there has been a shift to initial vancomycin to treat first episode non-severe CDI at our institution, which is consistent with recent guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Importantly, guidelines published by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, World Society of Emergency Surgery, and Australasian Society of Infectious Diseases still recommend the use of metronidazole for the first episode of non-severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Although the use of first-line vancomycin is recommended by most guidelines to treat severe CDI, there exists a discrepancy in treatment recommendations for first episode non-severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. There have been limited studies with long-term follow-up evaluating the use of initial metronidazole compared to initial vancomycin to treat non-severe inpatient CDI. In two large randomized controlled trials with follow-up of 3 weeks and 4 weeks, respectively, subgroup analyses stratified by severity did not demonstrate significant differences in relapse rates between the metronidazole or vancomycin treatment groups for non-severe CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Similarly, two cohort studies reported that relapse rates and 30-day mortality did not differ amongst patients with mild-to-moderate CDI treated with metronidazole or vancomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Therefore, we sought to identify predictors of adverse clinical outcomes and evaluate the use of initial vancomycin for the treatment of first episode non-severe CDI among adult inpatients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all adult inpatients with first episode CDI at our institution from January 1, 2013 to May 31, 2018. Patients were identified from hospital infection control registries maintained by Infection Prevention and Control, and all entries were validated against data reported to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. A CDI episode was characterized clinically as 3 or more type 5&#x2013;7 diarrheal stools on the Bristol stool scale, together with a positive <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> toxin gene loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay, in accordance with IDSA guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Patients with a prior history of CDI were excluded from the study.</p>
<p>Similarly, colonized patients who had a positive toxin assay but did not meet the clinical criteria of 3 or more type 5&#x2013;7 loose stools were excluded. Data abstracted included: comorbidities, medications, source of acquisition, clinical indicators at the time of diagnosis, positive specimen collection date, number of isolation days, stool type, stool frequency, relapse, recurrence, and death. Hospital-acquired infection (HAI) was defined as CDI present &#x003E;72 hours after admission or infection present on admission, whereas non-HAI was defined as CDI present &#x003C;72 hours after admission.</p>
<p>The primary exposures in this study were the treatment of first episode non-severe CDI with initial metronidazole or initial vancomycin. The outcomes of interest were relapse, recurrence, and all-cause 30-day mortality. All patients were followed for 26 weeks from the date of their initial CDI diagnosis. Relapse was defined as a CDI case occurring within 8 weeks after resolution of the initial CDI case, while recurrence was defined as a CDI case occurring more than 8 weeks after the resolution of the initial CDI episode. All-cause 30-day mortality was defined as death for any reason within 30 days of CDI diagnosis. CDI severity was defined according to guidelines published by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. A patient with any one of: white blood cell count &#x003E;15&#x00D7;10<sup>9</sup>/L, albumin level &#x003C;30g/L, or serum creatinine level &#x2265;133 mM/L was considered to have severe CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Logistic regression was used to determine prognostic factors for the composite outcome of relapse or all-cause 30-day mortality for the overall cohort. Relapse was selected as a patient-important outcome, as it is associated with a greater risk for complications and adverse outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. All-cause 30-day mortality was included in the composite outcome as it is a potential competing event for relapse. All factors were determined a priori based on published guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Univariable analysis with P&#x003C;0.2 was used, followed by stepwise selection in a multivariable logistic regression model. The number of variables entered into the model enabled 80&#x0025; study power with 15 events per factor.</p>
<p>To evaluate the impact of first-line vancomycin on adverse clinical outcomes in patients with first episode non-severe CDI, the initial vancomycin vs. initial metronidazole cohorts were first examined in an unadjusted logistic regression analysis for any combination of relapse, recurrence, and all-cause 30-day mortality. Prognostic factors for the overall cohort were then added to the adjusted multivariable analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 737 inpatients with first episode CDI were included in our study. Their demographics, clinical data at the time of CDI diagnosis, initial CDI treatment, and outcomes are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Patients had a median age of 72.3 years (Q1: 61.2, Q3: 83.3) and 628 (85.2&#x0025;) were classified to have non-severe CDI. 357 (48.4&#x0025;) of patients were classified to have hospital-acquired infection, while 309 (41.9&#x0025;) and 71 (9.6&#x0025;) were classified to have acquired CDI in the community and other institutions, respectively. Most patients, 496 (67.3&#x0025;), were initially diagnosed with CDI in a medical setting. At the time of CDI diagnosis, patients had an average temperature of 37.1&#x00B0;C (SD: 0.8) and median white blood count of 12.3 &#x00D7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L (Q1: 8.7, Q3: 18.1). The median time to treatment following CDI diagnosis was 2 days (Q1: 1, Q3: 5). Most patients, 539 (73.1&#x0025;), received initial metronidazole, while 130 (17.6&#x0025;) received initial vancomycin. Patients experienced a relapse rate of 17.4&#x0025;, a recurrence rate of 6.4&#x0025;, and a 30-day mortality rate of 12.8&#x0025;. The median time to relapse was 1.5 weeks (Q1: 1.0, Q3: 3.8) and the median length of time spent in isolation was 17 days (Q1: 7, Q3: 34).</p>

<p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the proportion of patients in the overall cohort who relapsed or experienced the composite outcome of relapse or 30-day mortality, given the number of prognostic factors in the multivariable logistic regression model.

<p>There were 628 (85.2&#x0025;) patients who were classified as having non-severe CDI, of whom 499 (79.5&#x0025;) and 129 (20.5&#x0025;) were treated with initial metronidazole and initial vancomycin, respectively. Among patients with first episode non-severe CDI, relapse, recurrence, and 30-day mortality rates were 17.4&#x0025;, 7.0&#x0025;, and 11.4&#x0025;, respectively, when treated with initial metronidazole, compared to 18.6&#x0025;, 3.1&#x0025;, and 7.8&#x0025;, respectively, when treated with initial vancomycin. To evaluate the impact of initial vancomycin for treatment of first episode non-severe CDI, the initial vancomycin and initial metronidazole cohorts were first examined in a univariable logistic regression analysis, followed by an adjusted multivariable analysis. The use of first-line vancomycin for treatment of first episode non-severe CDI was not associated with relapse, recurrence, or 30-day mortality alone (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, in an adjusted analysis, the use of first-line vancomycin for treatment of first episode non-severe CDI was associated with a reduction in the composite outcome of recurrence or 30-day mortality (OR<sub>adj</sub>: 0.51; 95&#x0025;CI: 0.28&#x2013;0.94; P=0.03).</p>

<sec id="s4">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although clinical trials have shown vancomycin to be superior to metronidazole for the treatment of severe CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], previous studies have suggested that metronidazole and vancomycin are equally effective for the treatment of non-severe CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Coupled with the higher cost of vancomycin and concerns associated with vancomycin-resistant enterococci, metronidazole has been the drug of choice for the treatment of non-severe CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> illustrates a scoring rule based on prognostic factors in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> which could help identify low-risk patient populations who are likely to do well on initial metronidazole. In recent years, however, guidelines, such as those published by the IDSA, have started to recommend first-line vancomycin for the treatment of non-severe CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Our findings support this recommendation but are also consistent with the conclusions of previous studies. The use of first-line vancomycin for the treatment of non-severe CDI, for instance, was not associated with relapse or 30-day mortality alone, which is consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. A strength of our investigation was the long duration of follow-up, 26 weeks in a pragmatic real-world setting, which allowed for conclusions about the impact of first-line vancomycin on recurrence, defined as a CDI episode occurring more than 8 weeks after resolution of the initial infection. In an adjusted analysis, the use of initial vancomycin for the treatment of first episode non-severe CDI was associated with a reduction in recurrence or 30-day mortality (OR<sub>adj</sub>: 0.51; 95&#x0025;CI: 0.28&#x2013;0.94; P=0.03).</p>
<p>The incidence of the virulent North American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type 1 (NAP1) strain has decreased over a 7-year period in Canadian hospital settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Given that the NAP1 strain has been associated with higher mortality and a more complicated course of disease, compared to non-NAP1 strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], it is possible that a recent decline in NAP1 CDI cases could explain the reduction in the composite outcome of recurrence or 30-day mortality associated with the use of initial vancomycin for the treatment of first episode non-severe CDI. At our institution, moreover, there has been an overall decline in recurrence rates in recent years, though it is unclear whether this should be attributed to the increased use of first-line vancomycin or other factors. A possible explanation for the lower recurrence rate experienced by patients who received initial vancomycin, compared to those treated with metronidazole, could be the broader spectrum antimicrobial activity of metronidazole which can be more disruptive to gut flora and predispose patients for re-infection and CDI recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>There were some limitations to our observational study. Patients were not randomized to treatment groups, for instance, and could have differed on key prognostic factors that may have influenced patient outcomes. To mitigate differences between groups, an adjusted analysis was done using prognostic factors found for the overall cohort.</p>
<p>Another limitation was the possible misclassification of exposures, since the treatment of CDI can evolve over a patient&#x2019;s stay. Patients were analyzed in a manner analogous to the intention-to-treat approach, based on the initial treatment assignment, and any treatment switches after 24 hours of the start of treatment were disregarded. Furthermore, although there was no observed increase in instances of vancomycin-resistant enterococci throughout our investigation, testing for this organism was non-systematic in nature. Finally, our investigation could have included some patients colonized with <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>, instead of true CDI. This is unlikely, however, as diagnosis of CDI was confirmed by one of three experienced infectious disease physicians, all cases were followed by a dedicated CDI consultation team, and CDI diagnosis required the presence of a positive toxin assay together with a clinical presentation of 3 or more type 5&#x2013;7 loose stools on the Bristol stool scale.</p>
