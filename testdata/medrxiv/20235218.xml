<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>BACKGROUND</title>
<p>A recent trial (NCT04308668) found that post-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was associated with a reduced incidence of Covid-19 by 17&#x0025; overall; 36&#x0025; in younger subjects, 31&#x0025; in household contacts and 49&#x0025; given within one day. To understand these trends, we re-analyzed the released dataset.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>METHODS</title>
<p>Our protocol conformed to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT). We compared the incidence of Covid-19 after HCQ or placebo, stratifying by intervention lag, age, and gender.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>Requesting additional data, we found that 52&#x0025; of subjects received medication 1-2 days after the intended overnight delivery; 19&#x0025; of them outside the intended four-day intervention lag. After re-analysis, there was a reduced incidence of Covid-19 associated with HCQ compared with placebo (9.6&#x0025; vs. 16.5&#x0025;) when received Early (up to 3 days) after exposure (RR 0.58, 95&#x0025;CI 0.35 - 0.97; <italic>p</italic>=0.044; NNT 14.5) but not Late (RR 1.22, 95&#x0025;CI 0.72 - 2.04).</p><p>We found a significant HCQ-associated Covid-19 reduction in subjects 18 to 45 years old with Early (RR 0.54, 95&#x0025;CI 0.29-0.97; <italic>p</italic>=0.0448, NNT 11.5) but not Late (RR 1.02, 95&#x0025;CI 0.55-1.89) prophylaxis, attenuated in older subjects (RR 0.75, 95&#x0025;CI 0-27-2.05) and by co-morbidities. There were reductions associated with Early prophylaxis in household contacts (RR 0.35, 95&#x0025;CI 0.13-0.89; p=0.025, NNT 5.7) and Health Care Workers (RR 0.74, 95&#x0025;CI 0.4-1.38). We did not detect effects of gender, folate, zinc, or ascorbic acid.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>Using novel data with a prospective <italic>post hoc</italic> re-analysis, hydroxychloroquine, in an age-dependent manner, was associated with reduced illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection when supplied for post-exposure prophylaxis between 1 and 3 days after high-risk or moderate-risk exposure, at higher loading and maintenance doses than in similar studies. This finding warrants prospective confirmation.</p><p>Registered with the Open Science Framework (last revised September 27, 2020, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://osf.io/fqtnw">osf.io/fqtnw</ext-link>).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Short Summary</title>
<p>A prospective re-analysis of a public dataset integrated with novel data found an HCQ-associated reduction of illness compatible with Covid-19 when received between 1 and 3 days after a high-risk or moderate-risk exposure (RR 0.58, 95&#x0025; CI 0.35-0.97, p=0.044, NNT14.5).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Plain Language Summary</title>
<p>A recent clinical trial examined the ability of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to prevent Covid-19 just after an exposure to a person confirmed to have Covid-19. There was an HCQ-associated reduction of Covid-19 by an overall 17&#x0025;; 36&#x0025; in younger subjects, and 49&#x0025; in subjects given HCQ within one day of being exposed. Likely because the study had too few patients to find what may have been a medically and economically meaningful, reduction, this effect was not statistically significant.</p><p>Studying the trial data, we discovered an unintended and variable delay in the delivery of study drug which may have masked any drug effect. The investigators provided further information at our request that confirmed our theory. About half of the participants received drugs one or two days later than intended, about a fifth beyond the four days the investigators thought the drug might work.</p><p>When we factored in this new information, we found that if HCQ was given early (up to three days after exposure), it was associated with a statistically significant 42&#x0025; reduction of Covid-19. Giving HCQ later had no effect. There was a greater effect in younger (less than 45 years) rather than older subjects (47&#x0025; vs. 25&#x0025;). Gender did not seem to affect the results, but there was a greater HCQ-associated reduction (65&#x0025;) when it was given early to people exposed to Covid-19 in a household environment rather than to health care workers (26&#x0025;). The effects associated with HCQ were better in people without co-existing conditions.</p><p>These re-calculations are important because the study, as originally analyzed, was the only randomized study that dealt with preventing Covid-19 cited by FDA to support a key public health decision made in June 2020 regarding HCQ. Although other studies have shown that the drug is not effective to treat established cases of Covid-19, our research suggests that that it is effective for prevention. Other prevention studies have failed to show a benefit of HCQ, possibly because they have used lower doses or have estimated the timing of dosing differently. Our research paves the way for our result to be confirmed under clinical trial conditions and for a re-examination of public health policy regarding this drug. Even with the introduction of vaccination, there remains a need for approaches like this to prevent Covid-19 while individual and community immunity develops, especially in subjects given a lower priority for vaccination.</p></sec>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>The following revisions have been made since version 1 of this manuscript28 was pre-printed December 2, 2020.
i)Additional comments related to just published full paper version of Barnabas et al.,29 previously cited as abstract version. Discussion of dose and loading dose effects between comparable studies, with added Table 5.
ii)Revision of discussion to reflect age strata revision in PrEP study from pre-print to published versions
We had noted in our pre-printed protocol22 that the age strata used in the pre-printed companion PrEP study24 differed from those used in the companion PEP27 and PET30 studies. These strata have been revised in the published version25 to match the other two studies. The pre-printed Version 1 of this manuscript also reflected the earlier age strata, which we now revise and add a comparison (Table S 6) between the PEP and PrEP studies.
iii)Table (Table S 5) added for effect of HCQ by risk level and contact type. Differences in the baseline incidence of Covid-19 and the relationship between contact type, risk level and changes in risk definitions are further discussed in main body and Supplement.
iv)Discussion revised concerning statistical limitations.
v)Comments added regarding remaining need for non-vaccine approaches.
vi)Citation of Mitja31 study: Some RR values changed to aRR to reflect adjustment noted in Mitja Table 2 and apparent discrepancy with values in Mitja Figure 1.
vii)Table 4: non-stratified totals added

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There have been (as of December 11, 2020) over 69.1 million cases of Covid-19 and over 1.57 million deaths worldwide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> about one fifth of them within the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> With early interest in deploying hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in March 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Lacking randomized clinical trial (RCT) data, emerging observational reports (with exceptions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>) disfavored HCQ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> With safety concerns, FDA cautioned<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> against using HCQ outside hospital or trial settings on April 24.</p>
<p>HCQ became highly controversial, with suggestions that <italic>&#x201C;to some extent the media and social forces &#x2014; rather than medical evidence &#x2014; are driving clinical decisions and the global Covid-19 research agenda</italic>.<italic>&#x201D;</italic><sup><italic>7</italic></sup> Against this background, on June 15, FDA revoked<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> HCQ&#x2019;s EUA, citing only two just-published RCTs. The RECOVERY Trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> was cited as offering &#x201C;<italic>persuasive evidence of a lack of benefit of HCQ in the treatment of hospitalized patients</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The second and only study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> addressing prevention examined post-exposure prophylaxis (the &#x201C;PEP&#x201D; study) with HCQ in 821 asymptomatic adults with a household or occupational exposure to Covid-19. Subjects received HCQ (1.4g first day, then 600 mg daily for 4 more days) or placebo (folate - USA; lactose - Canada). The study concluded that <italic>&#x201C;&#x2026;HCQ did not prevent illness</italic> [&#x2026;] <italic>when initiated within 4 days after</italic> [&#x2026;] <italic>exposure&#x201D;</italic> (HCQ 11.8&#x0025; vs. placebo 14.3&#x0025;; RR 0.83, 95&#x0025;CI 0.58-1.18, p=0.35).</p>
<p>We<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and others have criticized the study&#x2019;s interpretation. Since this was a pragmatic trial, with typically greater heterogeneity and smaller effect sizes than in an explanatory trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> powering the study to detect a 50&#x0025; reduction in Covid-19 may have been over-ambitious, especially given its early termination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> A reduction of 17&#x0025; is arguably<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> clinically meaningful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Rather than targeting specific clinical goals, the authors suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> that the study was primarily powered to collect data quickly under pandemic conditions.</p>
<p>Non-statistically significant signals of HCQ-associated efficacy included an a 31&#x0025; reduction among household cohabitees. There were age-dependent reductions found in other analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> to be statistically significant. The folate placebo and ex-protocol use of zinc and ascorbate may have been confounding (Supplement). With a reduction of 49&#x0025; associated with early (&#x201C;Day 1&#x201D;) HCQ prophylaxis, we<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> found a negative association between intervention lag and reduction of Covid-19.</p>
<p>We conjectured that <italic>post hoc</italic> exploratory re-analysis of the PEP study would inform a time- and age-nuanced approach to Covid-19 using HCQ, testable prospectively. Our objectives were to define: (a) any time- or (b) age-dependent effects associated with HCQ and, (c) any influence of gender, exposure type, use of zinc, ascorbate or folate on outcomes.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Dataset and Protocol Revisions</title>
<p>One protocol (NCT04308668) described separately reported PEP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> or early post-exposure treatment (PET)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> cohorts. The de-identified PEP dataset was released (covidpep.umn.edu/data) with revisions: September 9 (&#x201C;9/9&#x201D;), October 6 (&#x201C;10/6&#x201D;) and October 30 (&#x201C;10/30&#x201D;) 2020.</p>
<p>Using the Open Science Framework (OSF) protocol template (osf.io/jea94/), we conformed to the SPIRIT checklist (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>) integrating the WHO Trial Registration Data Set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Our protocol was registered on August 13, 2020 with revisions (Supplement), most recently September 27, 2020 (osf.io/vz8a7/<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>) prior to receiving data regarding the time to drug receipt in the 10/6 revision.</p>
<p>Four main areas required clarification (Supplement) related to: (i) exposure risk definition; (ii) study medication adherence; (iii) &#x201C;intervention lag&#x201D; (time from exposure to receipt of medication, resolved by the 10/6 revision); (iv) nomenclature for timing study events. Counting the date of highest reported exposure to Covid-19 as &#x201C;Day 1,&#x201D; this adopted clarification yields some inconsistencies with the original paper indicating the occurrence of study events to be one day later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Analysis Plan</title>
<p>We re-stratified data by intervention lag and then by age, gender, exposure type, risk level, or use of zinc or ascorbate. An Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis was employed as in the original study. We analyzed data according to adherence to taking study medication, provision of outcome data, use of the folate placebo, and presence of co-morbidities (Supplement).</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>We retained the original primary outcome variable</title>
<p><italic>&#x201C;incidence of either laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or illness compatible with Covid-19 within 14 days,&#x201D;</italic> comparing treatment arms using Fisher&#x2019;s Exact test. We examined the severity of symptoms at 14 days according to a visual analogue scale originally described as a secondary outcome (Kruskal-Wallis test).</p>
<p>We mirrored the original use of two-tailed tests without adjustment for multiple comparisons. This is further justified by the exploratory nature of our analyses. p-values &#x2264; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Larger values are presented to identify trends. Microsoft Excel was used for data processing. Vassar Stats (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vassarstats.net/">vassarstats.net/</ext-link>) was used for verification. The original authors provided two calculations from which we verified our primary time stratification (Supplement).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Ethics Committee Approval</title>
<p>No ethics committee approval was required as we used a de-identified, publicly released dataset.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Considering shipping schedules, we estimated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> that within each of the reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> strata for &#x201C;Time from exposure to enrollment&#x201D; (1 to 4 days), there were overlapping variations in intervention lag. For example, some &#x201C;Day 1&#x201D; (range 1.4-4.4 days) and &#x201C;Day 4&#x201D; (range 4.4-7.4 days) subjects may have received drug after the same interval.</p>
<p>New data (9/9 revision) provided at our request broadly confirmed these estimates revealing a reduction in Covid-19 associated with HCQ given within 2 days of exposure (RR 0.35, 95&#x0025;CI 0.13 &#x2013; 0.93; p=0.0438) but not later (RR 0.98, 95&#x0025;CI 0.67 &#x2013; 1.45).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Recognizing limitations (Supplement) to these estimates, further detail was requested and provided (10/6 revision). The PEP study protocol had intended to enroll only those receiving drug within 4 days from exposure, assuming overnight shipping. We found that 332 and 95 subjects (52&#x0025; of all subjects) received medication one or two days later than this respectively, with 152/821 (19&#x0025;) subjects receiving drug outside the intended 4-day window (Table S 3).</p>
<p>We stratified subjects according to the intervention lag, in keeping with the declared aim of the original protocol. We found an HCQ-associated reduction in Covid-19 when received &#x201C;Early&#x201D; between 1 and 3 days after exposure from 16.5&#x0025; to 9.6&#x0025; (RR 0.58, 95&#x0025;CI 0.35 &#x2013; 0.97; p=0.044; NNT 14.5) but not later (&#x201C;Late&#x201D;) (RR 1.22, 95&#x0025;CI 0.72 &#x2013; 2.04) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We did not detect differences in symptom severity scores for either time strata (Supplement). A comparison of the demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups shows a largely conserved balance between the Early and Late cohorts (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Table S 1).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Adopting the same age strata as the PEP study, we found in the Early cohort non statistically significant Risk Ratios of 0.53 (18-35 years), 0.52 (36-50 years), and 2.80 (&#x003E; 50 years). With no <italic>a priori</italic> reason for selecting these strata, the data are less subjectively supportive of two age strata. Conservatively (Supplement), we set the boundary at 45 years. We found HCQ-associated reductions of Covid-19 when given Early in both younger (18-45 years) (RR 0.54, 95&#x0025;CI 0.29-0.97; p=0.0448, NNT 11.5) and older (&#x003E;45 years) (RR 0.75, 95&#x0025;CI 0-27-2.05) subjects. Within the Early and Late cohorts, further stratification revealed no obvious gender-dependent effects (Table S 4).</p>
<p>Considering only subjects reporting no co-morbidities (particularly excluding asthma and co-morbidities classified as &#x201C;other&#x201D;), suggested stronger effects associated with HCQ within time- or age-related strata (Supplement).</p>
<p>Numerical differences in HCQ-associated effects of Early prophylaxis in the whole cohort between Household (RR 0.69) and HCW (0.92) contacts reached statistical significance after time-stratification with a reduction of Covid-19 in household contacts (RR 0.35, 95&#x0025;CI 0.13-0.89; p=0.025, NNT 5.7, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Differences in the baseline incidence of Covid-19 and the relationship between contact type, risk level and changes in risk definitions are described in the Supplement.</p>

<p>Directionally similar results were obtained after excluding subjects not contributing outcome data and subjects who did not take study medication. Stratifying into Early and Late prophylaxis cohorts revealed no discernible effect associated with folate (Supplement). With poorly detailed observational data, there did not appear to be an effect associated with zinc or ascorbate (Supplement). The use of zinc and ascorbate appears balanced between the groups both for the whole cohort and the Early and Late time strata (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In tackling our primary objective of defining any temporal effect of HCQ, we understood that HCQ prophylaxis had been &#x201C;<italic>initiated within 4 days after</italic> [&#x2026;] <italic>exposure</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Although others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> including the authors of NIH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> guidelines and the editorial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> accompanying the paper, shared this understanding, it requires revision for two main reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, many participants received medication after the intended overnight delivery or after four days from exposure. A similar issue likely pertains to the companion PET study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Secondly, inconsistent terminology led to an overestimate by one day of the time from exposure to enrollment or to drug receipt.</p>
<p>Correcting these understandings yields a statistically significant reduction of Covid-19 by 42&#x0025; associated with HCQ received between 1 and 3 days after exposure, but not later. The early use of HCQ is supported by estimates for an incubation period of 3-8 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>We found an age-dependent, statistically significant reduction of Covid-19 associated with Early prophylaxis. Re-analyzing the same PEP dataset without time stratification, we confirmed (Supplement) Luco&#x2019;s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> report of HCQ-associated reductions in Covid-19 in subjects younger than 50 years reaching statistical significance in the high-risk exposure cohort. Interpretation of age-related effects is limited by a poorly understood relationship between age and susceptibility to Covid-19, increases in incubation period with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and a low representation of older subjects with a low baseline incidence of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Small population sizes within the co-morbidity subgroups prompt cautious interpretation. However, the presence of co-morbidities attenuated age- and time-dependent HCQ-associated effects. Although age-related responses associated with HCQ may be related to co-morbidity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> excluding co-morbid patients did not yield equivalent effects in age strata. Asthma and co-morbidities classified as &#x201C;other&#x201D; contributed most to attenuating the HCQ-associated response. This finding is supported by the application of Multiple Correspondence Analysis and the Mantel test to the same dataset by Luco<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> who described confounding clinical differences between arms particularly regarding asthma and &#x201C;other&#x201D; co-morbidities.</p>
<p>Mirroring the original data, we found a significant HCQ-associated effect in household contacts. This result may reflect differences in access to advanced PPE, hygiene training, likely multiple exposures, and the ability to quarantine after exposure. Thus, household contacts in this study may share much with first responders in the companion PrEP study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> where a 64&#x0025; reduction in Covid-19 associated with HCQ was observed (combined dose groups). Further, the changing risk definitions and their apparently inconsistent application between contact types may confound understanding of how contact type and risk level affect Covid-19 development. Whether the apparent lack of an HCQ-associated effect in moderate-risk exposures is a statistical aberration or is biologically meaningful is unclear.</p>
<p>With a small &#x201C;no folate&#x201D; cohort, we did not detect an effect of folate. Due a paucity of data, we could not determine whether there was an effect of zinc or ascorbate other than noting no differences associated with HCQ in subjects taking neither agent and the entire ITT cohort. Based on the apparently balanced use of zinc and ascorbate in the stratified cohorts, confounding due to these agents seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Our findings are made in the climate of concern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> for the reliability of publications related to Covid-19 and the controversy surrounding HCQ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> This is partly fueled by a widening understanding of Covid-19 pathogenesis and the multiple, sometimes stage-dependent, mechanisms proposed for HCQ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>In hospitalized patients RCT findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> evincing HCQ&#x2019;s ineffectiveness are supported by observational studies, notably two<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> that report significant HCQ-associated reductions in mortality only with the use of zinc. The possibly synergistic use of steroids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> may further confound some studies. At earlier stages, any HCQ-associated effect appears independent of zinc, evinced (weakly) by the lack of synergy we observed. Further, using zinc may be futile in otherwise healthy, especially younger subjects with no zinc deficiency or dysregulation.</p>
<p>For prophylaxis, understanding differences in the ability to quarantine, testing methods, co-morbidities, and the possibility of multiple rather than single &#x201C;index&#x201D; exposures, appear important in reconciling apparently conflicting studies. Relying on different pharmacokinetic models, differences in dosing and intervention lag may be particularly significant (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl5" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 5:</label>
<caption><p>Comparison of HCQ-associated effects after early prophylaxis in similar PEP studies</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="20235218v2_tbl5.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Our findings are consistent with those of an Indian study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> in which subjects mostly exposed to laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases could opt to receive standard care alone or HCQ prophylaxis. With lower loading and maintenance doses than in the PEP study (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), there was an HCQ-associated 45&#x0025; reduction of Covid-19 at 4 weeks. A single &#x201C;index&#x201D; exposure could not be identified. Subjects enrolled after the primary case positive report and prophylaxis began at the earliest within 48 hours of knowing about the high-risk contact (D. Dhibar personal communication).</p>
<p>A well-executed cluster-randomized trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> from Spain reported a small HCQ-associated reduction of Covid-19 (aRR 0.86, 95&#x0025;CI 0.52-1.42), with the same loading dose as the Indian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> study but more frequent dosing over a shorter period (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The mean age was higher (48.6 years) than in the PEP study (41.6 years) where we have described possible age-dependent effects. There were poor HCQ-associated effects with an intervention lag of &#x003C;= 3 days (RR 0.89), 4-6 days (RR 0.93) and later (RR 4.09). Notably, there were differences according to PCR testing status at baseline. In PCR-positive subjects there was no HCQ-associated effect (aRR 1.02; 95&#x0025;CI 0.64&#x2013;1.63), whereas for PCR-negative patients there was an effect signal (aRR 0.68, 95&#x0025;CI 0.34&#x2013;1.34). A change in PCR status is likely to be a function of the moment beyond which a drug is unlikely to be effective, possibly more accurately than an estimate of intervention lag. Accordingly, this study supports our findings suggesting a beneficial effect of early intervention.</p>
<p>Another well-executed household-randomized trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> examined the effect of HCQ given to subjects (PCR negative at baseline) exposed to an infected person. Daily, subjects self-collected nasal swabs for PCR testing. By day 14, no difference in infection rate was associated with HCQ even for intervention lags under 72hrs. Underestimation of intervention lag using the time to dosing from last contact, rather than from first contact, may mask the ability to observe any time-dependent effect. As the authors acknowledge, the dosing, which is the lowest among comparable studies (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), may have been insufficient. The substantive lack of a loading dose may have extended the intervention lag beyond an effective range. The possibly anti-viral effect of the ascorbate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> placebo may have confounded the results. Although data were not age-stratified, the populations was of a similar age to the PEP study, but with a higher representation of Hispanic subjects.</p>
<p>Differences in HCQ-associated responses between &#x201C;Early&#x201D; and &#x201C;Late&#x201D; PEP illustrate the poorly defined position that PEP occupies on a continuum between PrEP and PET. The variable possibility of other exposures occurring before and after a single &#x201C;index&#x201D; exposure means that the Early PEP cohort has much in common with the population of the companion PrEP study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Although the PrEP study was hampered by poor recruitment, once or twice weekly use of HCQ (after a loading dose) in HCW was associated with reduced development of Covid-19 by 27&#x0025;, compared with folate placebo (HR 0.73, CI 0.48-1.09, p=0.12, combined groups). Age related HCQ-associated effects were of a similar order of magnitude (34-45&#x0025;) in the PEP and PrEP studies (Supplement Table S 6), consistent with the findings of an observational study involving mainly younger HCW.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> Comparison with another PrEP RCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> in HCW, with a very small population (n=132), early termination, and a low incidence of Covid-19, lacks meaning.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Given the enormity of the pandemic, we adopted a drug-development approach to glean efficacy signals possibly lost in the original study due to Type II errors related to underpowering, early termination and an environment of poorly understood pathogenesis. This could well justify shifting the threshold of toleration for Type I errors and other statistical challenges related to sub-group analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> These are partially offset by our use of two-sided tests, when directionality in the original data may have justified otherwise. Our primary time stratification based on newly-acquired data essentially represents the <italic>a priori</italic> analysis intended by the original authors. Nonetheless, this does remain a <italic>post hoc</italic> study; results should be interpreted cautiously, and hypotheses should be tested in prospective studies sufficiently powered to accommodate multiple comparisons in sub-groups.</p>
<p>Our study retains the limitations acknowledged by its original authors related to the availability and access to testing, the use of a clinical case definition of Covid-19, the reliance on self-reported data and the generally young population studied. There are other limitations. The study poorly represents African-American and Hispanic or Latino populations. The rapidly executed study overcame several logistical challenges to allow the collection of real-world data, having both advantages and disadvantages of a pragmatic design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Self-selection bias inherent in this type of study may have been compounded by FDA cautions regarding HCQ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> Unlike similar studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> the PEP study was not cluster-randomized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Limitations not already discussed relate to the estimation of the interval between exposure and treatment with 24-hour windows of uncertainty on either side. The earlier window is due to subjects providing only the date of their highest risk exposure. The later window is due to de-identification of shipping data, and the unknown interval before ingesting the first dose. The original authors (personal communication) attempted to minimized this by delivering medication to where the participant knew they would be at its expected arrival time.</p>
<p>Time-related or other biases may be associated with the exclusion of 100 randomized subjects who became symptomatic before medication was received and aggregated into the companion treatment study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Lastly, analysis of the effect of risk level is confounded by an inability to discriminate between nuances within the risk categories</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> of the PEP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> companion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and other<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> studies raise no significant safety concerns for using HCQ in the populations studied. Integrating a public dataset with new unpublished data, we found that, especially in younger subjects, hydroxychloroquine was associated with significantly reduced illness compatible with Covid-19 when initiated between 1 and 3 days after a high-risk or moderate-risk exposure at higher loading and maintenance doses than in similar studies. With relevance to pre-exposure prophylaxis, these findings warrant prospective confirmation until individual and community immunity is achieved with widespread availability of vaccination.</p>
