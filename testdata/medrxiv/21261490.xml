<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Sleep apnea is a common disorder that represents a global public health burden. <italic>KCNK3</italic> encodes TASK-1, a K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channel implicated in the control of breathing, but its link with sleep apnea remains poorly understood. Here we describe a novel developmental disorder with sleep apnea caused by rare <italic>de novo</italic> gain-of-function mutations in <italic>KCNK3</italic>. The mutations cluster around the &#x2018;X-gate&#x2019;, a gating motif which controls channel opening, and produce overactive channels that no longer respond to inhibition by G-protein coupled receptor pathways, but which can be inhibited by several clinically relevant drugs. These findings demonstrate a clear role for TASK-1 in sleep apnea and identify possible therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sleep apnea is thought to affect up to 1 billion people worldwide and is characterized by abnormal, interrupted breathing during sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The poor quality of sleep that arises results in huge economic and societal impact, a decreased quality of life, and increases the risk of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and depression, as well as the risk of motor vehicle accidents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Sleep apnea is therefore a major public health burden and there is a large unmet clinical need for more effective treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, it is also a complex disorder and the mechanisms involved are often unclear.</p>
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that instability of ventilatory control is involved in the pathogenesis of both central and obstructive sleep apnea, the two principal forms of the disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Peripheral and central chemoreceptors which detect O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> levels also play a critical role, though their molecular identity and the neuronal networks involved remain poorly defined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Two-Pore Domain K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channels (K2P) are a structurally distinct subset of K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channels where each gene encodes a subunit with two pore-forming domains that co-assemble as a &#x2018;dimer of dimers&#x2019; to create a single pseudotetrameric K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> selective channel across the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. K2P channels underlie the background K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> currents that control the membrane potential in many different cell types. Originally described as &#x2018;leak&#x2019; channels, their activity is now known to be regulated by diverse stimuli, including many G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways, thus enabling them to integrate different neuronal, metabolic and cellular signaling pathways into changes in cellular electrical activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Such regulatory pathways are known to be important in many of the neural systems that regulate breathing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, including the control of respiratory drive immediately after birth where dysfunctional regulation of this pathway gives rise to an increased frequency of spontaneous apneas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>KCNK3</italic> encodes the TASK-1 K2P channel and is expressed in a variety of neuronal populations throughout the central nervous system, including many chemosensitive regions involved in the control of ventilation as well in hypoglossal and spinal cord motor neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In peripheral tissues, TASK-1 is also found in the carotid bodies, lung, heart, and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Its expression throughout these tissues has therefore implicated TASK-1 in the control of breathing and also in sleep apnea<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, an X-ray crystal structure of the TASK-1 channel has recently been reported in complex with a compound class of TASK-1 inhibitors currently in clinical trials for the treatment of sleep apnea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. This structure also revealed several unique features of TASK-1, including a lower &#x2018;X-gate&#x2019;, a structural motif which controls opening and closing of the channel pore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, a clear mechanistic link between TASK-1 and sleep apnea remains unproven and is further complicated by the propensity of TASK-1 subunits to co-assemble with related TASK-3 (<italic>KCNK9</italic>) subunits to form novel heteromeric TASK-1/TASK-3 channels in cells where both genes are coexpressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, heterozygous loss-of-function variants in <italic>KCNK3</italic> are associated with a different disorder, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), an adult-onset, progressive and often fatal disease characterized by increased pulmonary arterial pressure in the absence of the common causes of pulmonary hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>; in addition loss-of-function mutations in the TASK-3 channel (<italic>KCNK9</italic>) are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder, Birk Barel syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study we describe nine probands with <italic>de novo</italic> missense mutations in <italic>KCNK3</italic> who exhibit global developmental delay, hypotonia, and central/obstructive sleep apnea with a range of structural malformations. The mutations all cluster near the recently identified lower X-gate of the TASK-1 channel and result in a novel gain-of-function phenotype that correlates with the severity of their disorder. These results have important implications for the treatment of these probands and other individuals with sleep apnea, as well as for our understanding of the role that TASK-1 channels play in cellular function.</p>

<title>Recurrent missense mutations in KCNK3 cause developmental delay with sleep apnea</title>
<p>A recent analysis of 31,058 parent-offspring trios with severe developmental disorders identified 28 novel disease-causing genes with a high burden of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations, including one caused by recurrent missense variants in <italic>KCNK3</italic> (ENST00000302909; NM_002246)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Through parent-offspring exome sequencing performed across four different diagnostic laboratories and research studies, we have now identified a total of nine probands, each heterozygous for one of six <italic>de novo</italic> missense variants in <italic>KCNK3</italic> (<bold>Methods</bold> and <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). These novel mutations were found to cluster in two regions of the protein (ENSP00000306275.3; NP_002237): L122V, L122P, G129D (two probands), and N133S (three probands) in the second transmembrane helix (M2); whilst L239P and L241F are in the fourth transmembrane helix (M4) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>All nine probands share similar phenotypes that define this new rare monogenic channelopathy, which we henceforth refer to as &#x2018;Developmental Delay with Sleep Apnea&#x2019; (DDSA) (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). All living probands (8/9, aged 3-25 years) had hypotonia, global developmental delay, central and/or obstructive sleep apnea that required nocturnal O<sub>2</sub>, and feeding difficulties that necessitated the insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. One proband was terminated at 21 weeks due to abnormalities detected during routine ultrasound scanning. The majority of probands (7/9) had major structural malformations, including microcephaly, arthrogryposis/flexion contractures, scoliosis, cleft palate and bilateral talipes, with some facial dysmorphology, and the male probands (5/6) had ambiguous genitalia.</p>
<p>However, two probands (aged 1-5 and 20-25 years) are notably less severely affected, with feeding difficulties, hypotonia and sleep apnea, but only mild developmental delay and no structural abnormalities. Intriguingly, both mutations (L239P, L241F) in these two phenotypically milder individuals are located in the M4 helix of the TASK-1 protein, whereas those in the more severely affected probands (L122V/P, G129D, N133S) are all found in the M2 helix.</p>

<title>DDSA mutations cluster around the X-gate in TASK-1</title>
<p>Most K2P channels are thought to open and close by controlling a &#x2018;gate&#x2019; within their K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> selectivity filter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. However, a recent structure of TASK-1 revealed a novel lower gate formed by an interaction of the pore-lining M4 helices that occludes the entrance to the pore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Importantly, this closed &#x2018;X-gate&#x2019; structure contains a six amino acid motif (VLRFMT) previously implicated in the control of channel activity by volatile anesthetics and GPCRs, though the mechanisms involved in opening and closing the pore remain unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Upon examination of the TASK-1 crystal structure (PDB ID: 6RV2), we found that, even though these six DDSA mutations are on two different transmembrane helices (M2 and M4), they all cluster near the X-gate and are involved in either inter- and/or intra-subunit interactions likely to hold the X-gate closed (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplementary Fig.1a,b</xref></bold>).

<title>DDSA mutations produce a gain-of-function phenotype in TASK-1</title>

Two-Electrode Voltage Clamp (TEVC) recordings revealed whole-cell K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> currents markedly larger than WT TASK-1.

<title>Gain-of-function in &#x2018;heterozygous&#x2019; TASK-1 and heteromeric TASK-1/TASK-3 channels</title>
<p>K2P channels are dimeric and the results described above were all obtained in homomeric channels where both subunits contain the mutation. However, the DDSA probands are heterozygous for a single mutation, meaning a mixture of channels can be created from coassembly of WT and mutant subunits (25% WT, 50% &#x2018;heterozygous&#x2019; and 25% &#x2018;homomeric&#x2019; mutant). Therefore to better replicate this heterozygous genotype, we co-injected oocytes with WT TASK-1 mRNA plus an equal amount of either WT or mutant mRNA in a 1:1 ratio. In all cases, the resulting currents were at least 80% the size of currents formed by homomeric mutant channels (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>)</bold>. An increase in current was also observed for the most common DDSA variant (N133S) in a &#x2018;pure&#x2019; heteromeric channel formed from a covalently linked WT/mutant tandem dimer which constrains channel stoichiometry (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>TASK-1 can also coassemble with TASK-3 subunits to form novel heteromeric channels <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. We therefore co-injected oocytes with WT TASK-3 mRNA plus an equal amount of either WT or mutant TASK-1 mRNA. In this case, all the mutants, including L239P, produced larger heteromeric TASK-1/TASK-3 currents than when WT TASK-1 was used (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>). This demonstrates that all these DDSA mutations produce a gain-of-function in either heterozygous TASK-1 and/or heteromeric TASK-1/TASK-3 channels.

<p>Unlike many other K2P channels which exhibit relatively poor pharmacology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, TASK-1 can be inhibited by a range of potent and highly selective small molecules, including a number of clinically relevant drugs such as doxapram, carvedilol and bupivacaine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The most potent inhibitor of TASK-1 known to date is BAY1000493 which binds deep within the pore of the channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and is a close analog of another TASK-1 inhibitor recently used in a clinical trial for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (the &#x2018;KOALA&#x2019; trial, NCT04236440 currently being progressed into a larger Phase 2 study).</p>

This result is in marked contrast to the reported effect of other gain-of-function mutations, e.g. the L244A and M247A mutations engineered into the X-gate of TASK-1 which also both increases channel activity, but which markedly reduce BAY1000493 sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.

Normally, G&#x03B1;q activates phospholipase C (PLC) which hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), a lipid which supports the activity of many K2P channels, and so PIP<sub>2</sub> degradation usually reduces channel activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.

<p>PLC activation can also affect the levels of many other signaling lipids, including the endocannabinoid, anandamide (AEA) which directly inhibits TASK-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, and we found that the N133S mutation also impairs the inhibitory effect of AEA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we describe a new monogenic channelopathy, Developmental Delay with Sleep Apnea (DDSA), resulting from heterozygous <italic>de novo</italic> gain-of-function mutations in <italic>KCNK3</italic>. These mutations result in defective X-gating of TASK-1 and increased K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> currents through these channels. Although DDSA is rare, our results also now highlight the important link between TASK-1 channels and sleep apnea, and identify therapeutic opportunities for both DDSA patients and those who suffer from sleep apnea.</p>
<p>TASK-1 channels (including heteromeric TASK-1/TASK-3) have long been regarded as attractive targets for the treatment of sleep apnea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. However, even though drugs that target TASK-1 are currently being progressed into Phase 2 clinical trials for treatment of sleep apnea, a clear link with this disorder has not been established and has even been questioned<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Furthermore, until now, the only known genetic mutations in TASK-1 were associated with a completely different, hypertensive phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our results therefore provide the first direct evidence of a link between <italic>KCNK3</italic> and sleep apnea due to a new class of <italic>de novo</italic> gain-of-function mutations that have very different effects on cellular electrical activity compared to the loss-of-function mutations associated with PAH. This causal link is not only consistent with expression of TASK-1 in many of the chemosensitive cell types and tissues involved in regulation of breathing, but also with the fact that current clinical trials for sleep apnea aim to suppress TASK-1 K<sup>&#x002B;</sup> channel activity.</p>
<p>The DDSA probands identified in this study all have a developmental disorder that includes sleep apnea as well as a number of other cognitive and musculoskeletal phenotypes (see <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). It is well known that inappropriate spatiotemporal expression of an ion channel can affect the development of many cell types, especially neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and studies in developing mouse embryos have shown that <italic>KCNK3</italic> is expressed at an early stage especially in the developing CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. It is also important to note that the effect of these DDSA mutants on electrical activity will be very different to the loss-of function PAH mutations in TASK-1. The phenotype in these probands could therefore arise via several possible mechanisms: a general increase in homomeric TASK-1 activity, increased heteromeric TASK-1/TASK-3 activity, and/or the resistance of these channels to inhibition by G&#x03B1;q-coupled signaling pathways (see <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>). However, the relative contribution of these different molecular mechanisms will be difficult to dissect.</p>

<caption><title>Proposed model for effect of DDSA mutants on cellular electrical activity.</title>
<p>In wild type cells the activity of TASK-1 (i.e. homomeric TASK-1 and/or heteromeric TASK-1/TASK3) channels contribute to the hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (RMP). This activity can be inhibited by stimulation of G&#x03B1;q-coupled receptor pathways and results in depolarization of the RMP. This gating process involves closure of the cytoplasmic X-gate. However, in cells with a single heterozygous DDSA mutation in TASK-1, these mutations (marked as X) result in defective closure of the X-gate (marked in red). Consequently, TASK-1 channel activity is either increased and/or unresponsive to GPCR-mediated inhibition which amplifies the underlying gain-of-function. This increased channel activity keeps cells hyperpolarized near the RMP and also uncouples them from regulation by many different GPCR signaling pathways. Importantly, mutant channels retain sensitivity to inhibition by several high affinity small molecule inhibitors including BAY1000493 that is similar to compounds currently in clinical trial for the treatment of sleep apnea. This offers a range of possible therapeutic strategies for these probands and strengthens their proposed use for the treatment of sleep apnea.</p></caption>

<p>Despite the many phenotypic features shared by the probands, the two with mutations in the M4 helix were much less severely affected than the probands with mutations in the M2 helix, including only mild developmental delay and no structural abnormalities. Interestingly, these M4 mutations (L239P and L241F) each produced the smallest overall increase in whole-cell currents. This genotype-phenotype correlation may therefore provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the DDSA phenotypes, but further studies are required to confirm this. Strikingly, central and/or obstructive sleep apnea was experienced by all (living) probands, and the general gain-of-function in TASK-1 is common to all these variants. We also note that, despite the reported overexpression of <italic>KCNK3</italic> in atrial fibrillation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, none of these DDSA probands exhibited any obvious cardiac phenotype.</p>
<p>The functional properties of these mutations provides further insight into the molecular mechanism of TASK-1 gating; in particular, how the X-gate opens and how this is regulated by G&#x03B1;q-coupled pathways. In the structure of TASK-1, the channel pore is occluded by the lower X-gate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The six residues in M4 that form this constriction were previously identified as important for channel regulation by volatile anesthetics and by several G&#x03B1;q-coupled pathways, though the mechanisms involved were unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Our results show that the DDSA mutations all cluster near the X-gate in its closed conformation and are likely to disrupt stability of the closed X-gate. In particular, the recurrent N133S variant destabilizes a critical H-bond and promotes channel opening. Likewise, the inhibitory effect of DAG on TASK-1 channels suggest that it favors stability of the closed state. The fact that all DDSA mutations produce similar effects in both homomeric and &#x2018;heterozygous&#x2019; channels also suggests that disruption of the X-gate within a single subunit is sufficient to open the channel.</p>
<p>The increased whole-cell currents generated by these DDSA mutants result primarily from an increase in channel <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub> rather than an increased number of channels at the cell surface, and in some cases the mutants may even decrease surface expression; e.g. the L239P mutant has a 10-fold greater <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>, but has similar whole-cell currents to WT TASK-1, an effect that can only result from fewer channels in the membrane. However, G&#x03B1;q-mediated inhibition of the L239P mutant channel is also completely abolished and so the remaining currents become &#x223C;2-fold larger than WT TASK-1 and therefore represent a gain-of-function effect.</p>
<p>Fortunately, despite their activatory effects, these mutants all retain their sensitivity to a number of small molecule inhibitors, some of which are already in clinical use and/or ongoing clinical trials. This offers a realistic prospect for therapeutic intervention in DDSA probands that may improve their quality of life. It remains to be determined precisely how TASK-1 dysfunction produces the phenotype observed in DDSA, in particular sleep apnea. However, our findings markedly strengthen the proposed use of TASK-1 inhibitors to treat sleep apnea and provide important new insights into a sleep disorder that severely impacts many millions of lives.</p>

<p>Four probands were identified through the UK Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) Study, which has been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Briefly, probands with severe, undiagnosed developmental disordered and their parents were recruited and phenotyped by referring clinical geneticists in 24 regional genetics services across the National Health Services in the UK and Ireland. Saliva and/or blood-extracted DNA samples were analysed at the Wellcome Sanger Institute using massively parallel whole exome sequencing of the family trio using SureSelect RNA baits (Agilent Human All-Exon V3 Plus with custom ELID C0338371 and Agilent Human All-Exon V5 Plus with custom ELID C0338371). Enriched libraries were analysed by 75-base paired-end sequencing (Illumina HiSeq); reads were mapped to GRCh37/UCSC hg19 and variants called using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> and annotated using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. <italic>DeNovoGear</italic> was used to predict likely <italic>de novo</italic> mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and variants were identified for clinical feedback as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Three probands were identified by the USA-based diagnostics company GeneDX. Using genomic DNA from the proband and parents, the exonic regions and flanking splice junctions of the genome were captured using the Clinical Research Exome kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) or the IDT xGen Exome Research Panel v1.0. Massively parallel (NextGen) sequencing was done on an Illumina system with 100bp or greater paired-end reads. Reads were aligned to human genome build GRCh37/hg19, and analyzed for sequence variants using a custom-developed analysis tool. Additional sequencing technology and variant interpretation protocol has been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. The general assertion criteria for variant classification are publicly available on the GeneDx ClinVar page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/submitters/26957/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/submitters/26957/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>One proband was identified by the Mayo Medical Laboratories in the USA. Whole exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA extracted from all samples submitted. The exome was captured utilizing a custom reagent developed by Mayo Clinic and Agilent Technologies. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Next Generation sequencing instrument, using HapMap Sample NA12878 as an internal control. Paired-end 101 base-pair reads were aligned to a modified human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19) using Novoalign. Sequencing quality was evaluated using FastQC. All germline variants were jointly called through GATK Haplotype Caller and GenotypeGVCF and each variant was annotated using the BioR Toolkit. Using a custom-developed analysis tool, data were filtered and analyzed to identify clinically relevant sequence variants. Variants of interest were confirmed by automated Sanger sequencing.</p>
<p>One proband was identified at the German Institute of Clinical Genetics Dresden, Germany. DNA was extracted from blood-derived lymphocytes using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen). Patient as well as parental samples were studied in parallel (trio exome strategy). Exome capture was performed using IDT Xgene exome research panel. 150 nucleotide paired-end sequencing was performed with a median target coverage of at least 50-fold on Illumina NextSeq500 Sequencing systems. Alignment (mapping to GRCh37/hg19), variant identification (SNVs and indels), variant annotation and filtering was performed using the CLC Biomedical Genomics Workbench (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Variants were filtered with a focus on protein-altering variants (missense, frameshift, splice-site and premature stop-codons), rare in public databases (gnomAD, allele frequency below 1% and not more than 5 homozygous or hemizygous individuals). Additionally, variants were prioritized based on assumed inheritance patterns (de novo heterozygous, homozygous, hemizygous and compound heterozygous).</p>
<p>For all studies, candidate <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in <italic>KCNK3</italic> were visually inspected using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.

<p>The wild-type human TASK-1 gene (<italic>KCNK3</italic>) was subcloned into a plasmid vector (pFAW) suitable for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and expression in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. Unless otherwise stated, a volume of &#x223C;18 nl of mRNA was injected oocytes at a concentration of 110 ng/&#x03BC;l for either wild-type or mutants (i.e. 2 ng of RNA per oocyte). Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Briefly, after injection of mRNA, oocytes were incubated for 20&#x2013;24 h at 17.5&#x00B0;C and measured in ND96 buffer at pH 7.4 (96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 5 mM HEPES). Unless otherwise stated, currents were recorded using a 400 ms voltage step protocol from a holding potential of -80 mV delivered in 10 mV increments between -120 mV and &#x002B;50 mV and 800 ms ramp protocols from -120 to &#x002B;50 mV. All recorded traces were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments), and graphs were plotted using Origin2019b (OriginLab Corporation). Unless otherwise described, all results shown are reported as mean &#x00B1; standard deviation and obtained with oocytes from at least 3 independent batches.</p>
<p>Single-channel currents in cell-attached patches from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes were recorded in symmetrical 140mM KCl solutions containing 10mM HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH). Data was filtered at 2 or 5 kHz and recorded at a 200 kHz sampling rate with program Clampex on an Axopatch 200B amplifier. Data analysis was performed using Clampfit. Single channel current amplitude of the L239P mutant channels was estimated as follows. First, a closed level histogram for current values above 0 pA was approximated as a mirror image of the values below 0 pA and the resulting histogram was subtracted from the data. The mean single channel current amplitude <italic>i</italic> was then calculated from the following equation where <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> represents the number of openings with a current value <italic>i</italic><sub><italic>K</italic></sub>.

Giant excised membrane patch measurements in inside-out configuration under voltage-clamp conditions were made at room temperature 72-120 h after injection of 50nl channel specific mRNA into Xenopus <italic>laevis</italic> oocytes. Thick-walled borosilicate glass pipettes had resistances of 0.25 - 0.35 M&#x03A9; (tip diameter of &#x223C;15 - 30 &#x00B5;m) and were back-filled with extracellular solution containing (in mM): 4 KCl, 116 mM NMDG, 10 HEPES and 3.6 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH was adjusted to 7.4 with KOH/HCl). Bath solution was applied to the cytoplasmic side of the excised giant patches via a gravity flow multi-barrel application system and had the following composition (in mM): 120 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 EGTA and 1 Pyrophosphate. Currents were acquired with an EPC10 USB amplifier and HEKA PatchMaster 2&#x00D7;91 software. The sampling rate was 10 kHz and the analog filter was set to 3 kHz (&#x2212;3 dB). Voltage ramp pulses (&#x2212;80 mV to &#x002B;80 mV) were applied from a holding potential (V<sub>H</sub>) of -80 mV for 0.8 s with an interpulse interval of 9 s and were analyzed at a given voltage of &#x002B;40 mV. The relative steady-state levels of inhibition for indicated blocker were fitted with the following Hill equation:

Each structure was embedded into POPC membranes in independent triplicates and solvated by aqueous NaCl at 150 mM. Temperature and pressure were maintained at 310 K and 1 bar using the velocity-rescaling thermostat and a semi-isotropic Parrinello and Rahman barostat, with coupling constants of 0.1 ps and 1 ps, respectively. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald method. The integration time step was 2 fs. Covalent bonds were constrained through the LINCS algorithm.
