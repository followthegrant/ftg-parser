<title>Abstract</title>
<p>It has long been known that forensic and clinical toxicologists should not determine the dose of a drug administered based on postmortem blood drug concentrations but to date there has been limited information as to how unreliable these dose calculations can be. Using amitriptyline as a model drug this study used the empirically determined pharmacokinetic variables for amitriptyline from clinical studies and clinical, overdose (where the individual survived) and death (ascribed to amitriptyline toxicity) case studies in which the dose of drug administered or taken was known. Using these data, standard pharmacokinetic equations and general error propagation it was possible to estimate the accuracy of the consumed dose of amitriptyline compared to the actual dose consumed. As was expected in postmortem cases, depending on the pharmacokinetic equation used, the accuracy (mean &#x002B;128 to &#x002B;2347 &#x0025;) and precision (SD &#x00B1; 383 to 3698&#x0025;) were too large to allow reliable estimation of the dose of drug taken or administered prior to death based on postmortem blood drug concentrations. This work again reinforces that dose calculations from postmortem blood drug concentrations should not be carried out.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is common for forensic or clinical toxicologists to be asked by lawyers or law enforcement personnel to calculate the dose or amount of drug that may have been taken by or administered to a deceased person. The forensic toxicology community have long known that the pharmacokinetic equations used to calculate dose in life from measured drug blood concentrations are unsuitable for calculation of drug doses in death cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Thus guidelines from professional organisations such as the Society of Forensic Toxicologists (SOFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), AAFS standards board (ASB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) and United Kingdom Association of Forensic Toxicologists (UKIAFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) recommend that these calculations are not attempted. To date however there has been no published proof as to how unreliable these calculations can actually be. This study estimated the accuracy and precision that can arise in postmortem pharmacokinetic dose calculations using an example drug (amitriptyline) published clinical and case study data and general error propagation methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). This work was also able to determine the contribution of each of the variables to the overall uncertainty of the estimate of the dose taken (or administered).</p>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Standard Pharmacokinetic Equations</title>
<p>The most common pharmacokinetic equation for the calculation of the dose (at equilibrium and assuming complete absorption of the drug) is: -
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21255383v1_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
D = dose of drug (at the time of measurement of plasma/blood drug concentration) (mg), Wt = body weight (kg), C = drug plasma/blood concentration (mg/L) and V = volume of distribution (L/kg) or volume of distribution (L). Although this calculation will only give the dose in the body at the time of measurement. It will not give the dose of the drug administered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b">
<title>Calculation of Dose after Intravenous Administration</title>
<p>In order to determine the dose of the drug administered the time elapsed since the dose was administered (t) and the half-life (t&#x00BD;) of the drug would also need to be known. For an intravenous bolus dose of the drug, the equation would be: -
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21255383v1_eqn2.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
k = elimination rate constant (h<sup>-1</sup>), <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="21255383v1_inline1.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, t&#x00BD; = half-life (h), t = time since administration of dose (h).</p>
<p>This equation however assumes that the pharmacokinetics of the drug fit a one compartment model. In the one compartment model the drug is assumed to be instantaneously distributed throughout the body into a single theoretical compartment. It is more common for the pharmacokinetics of a drug to fit a two-compartment model where there is an initial (&#x03B1;) distribution of the drug from the &#x201C;first&#x201D; theoretical compartment (commonly considered to be the circulation) to a &#x201C;second&#x201D; theoretical compartment (commonly considered to be the tissues). The &#x03B1; distribution phase is followed by a second &#x03B2; phase where there is equilibrium between the two compartments and elimination is the predominant factor.</p>
<p>The dose calculation for a drug administered by an intravenous bolus that fits a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model is: -
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21255383v1_eqn3.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
When the drug is infused, a revised equation is used:
<disp-formula id="eqn3a">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21255383v1_eqn3a.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
&#x03B1; = elimination rate constant of &#x201C;distributive&#x201D; alpha phase (h<sup>-1</sup>)</p>
<p>&#x03B2; = elimination rate constant of &#x201C;elimination&#x201D; beta phase (h<sup>-1</sup>) equivalent to k in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation 1</xref>.</p>
<p>K<sub>21</sub> = first-order transfer rate constant from the peripheral compartment to the central compartment (h<sup>-1</sup>)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1c">
<title>Calculation of dose administered after oral administration</title>
<p>The dose calculation is different if the drug is administered (or taken) orally as in this calculation the bioavailability (the amount of drug administered that reaches the systemic circulation) needs to be taken into account. Assuming the drug has been completely absorbed the equation is: -
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21255383v1_eqn4.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
F= Bioavailability (no units)</p>
<p>Again, the complexity is increased if absorption is not complete in which case the rate constant for absorption (Ka) (h<sup>-1</sup>) is needed giving the equation: -
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21255383v1_eqn5.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>

<sec id="s1d">
<title>Determining the precision and accuracy of postmortem dose calculations</title>
<p>In order to investigate the accuracy and precision of the estimation of the dose of a drug taken (or administered) based on a postmortem blood concentration an example drug amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) was selected. Amitriptyline is a drug for which there is a large amount of clinical data on both the pharmacokinetic parameters but also case studies of doses that were taken in overdoses or deaths attributed to amitriptyline along with the relevant blood amitriptyline concentrations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1e">
<title>Pharmacokinetic Variables of Amitriptyline</title>
<p>A literature search was carried out to identify studies with empirically determined pharmacokinetic parameters of amitriptyline using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pubmed.gov">www.pubmed.gov</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scopus.com">www.scopus.com</ext-link> (06FEB21 and 07FEB21). Any relevant references found in the articles found during the search were also included in the study. Only papers that contained empirically determined amitriptyline pharmacokinetic parameters from human subjects listed in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation 1</xref> - <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">5</xref> were included. The data obtained from the publications was compiled in Microsoft Excel 2015 (Microsoft Corporation. Redmond. USA). In order to determine if the pharmacokinetic data collected from previously published studies was normally distributed a D&#x2019;Agostino &#x0026; Pearson omnibus normality test was carried out using GraphPad Prism version 6.01 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>) a p value of &#x2264; 0.05 was considered significant. Only the half-life (t&#x00BD;) and its linked variable the elimination rate constant (&#x03B2;) were found not to be normally distributed (data not shown). <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists the mean, mode, standard deviation (SD), range and coefficient of variance (&#x0025;CV) that were used for the &#x201C;average&#x201D; individual for the calculation of uncertainty and accuracy of the administered dose using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equations 1</xref> - <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">5</xref>. In one study (Burch and Hullin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>)) the raw data of the blood concentration versus time was available and these data were used to determine the variables required for <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equations 1</xref> - <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">5</xref> using the Excel plugin PKsolver 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>).</p>

<title>Uncertainty in dose calculations</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to a) estimate the overall precision of the calculation of dose from a postmortem blood drug concentration using the various relevant pharmacological equations. b) estimate the accuracy of the calculations of dose using pharmacokinetic equations and c) estimate the contribution of each of the variables in the pharmacokinetic equations to the overall uncertainty of the calculation of dose from postmortem blood drug concentrations. This was completed using a) average (mean) pharmacokinetic parameter data from primary literature sources (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); b) from pharmacological studies where the dose administered was known and c) from case studies (of both overdoses (where the individual survived) and cases where death (which attributed to amitriptyline overdose)). For these case studies to be included in this investigation it was important that the study included a reasonable estimate of the dose of amitriptyline than was taken (see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The accepted method determination of the uncertainty associated with calculations, is that of general error propagation using GUM principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) this has a sound mathematical basis and has previously been used forensically for alcohol calculations using the Widmark equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Detailed information about this method of error calculation can be found in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). In order to estimate the total uncertainty associated with the various dose calculation equations and the proportional contribution of each variable to the total uncertainty GUM Workbench EDU Version 2.4.1.384 (Metrodata GmbH, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.metrodata.de">www.metrodata.de</ext-link>) was used. It was assumed that all the variables were independent and that each of the variables were normally distributed. The relevant equations (depending on the case circumstances, clinical; overdose or death) were entered into the software (along with the relevant data from <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref> or <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>). In order to calculate the overall uncertainty of these data and the contribution of each of the variables to the overall uncertainty a randomly selected individual in each case series was selected. For the intravenous administration of amitriptyline (15 mg) subject AJ was used from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). For the oral administration of amitriptyline (100 mg) subject DB from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) was used. For the overdose and death cases only, oral administration was investigated as there were only oral overdoses and deaths. Subjects 2 and 3 from study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) for overdose were used and subjects 9 and 10 from study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) were used for the death cases. The ratio of amitriptyline to nortriptyline (the major metabolite of amitriptyline) was used to determine if the subject was in the elimination phase or the absorptive phase to allow selection of the relevant pharmacokinetic equation. Based on the work of Bailey &#x0026; Shaw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and Hebb <italic>et al</italic>., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) this study considered a ratio of amitriptyline to nortriptyline of &#x003C; 1.5 to be in the elimination phase and &#x003E; 1.5 to be in the absorptive phase. The accuracy of the calculated dose was determined using the following equation:

<title>Accuracy and precision of dose calculations from drug blood concentrations</title>
<p>As can be seen in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>, on average for clinical and overdose cases <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation 1</xref> was the most accurate and precise although there was a mean underestimation of the dose administered (approx. -0.6 to -82 &#x0025;). As expected, due to the increased complexity of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">equations 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">5</xref> ((that require additional factors such as half-life (t&#x00BD;), bioavailability (F), time since administration (t) and absorption rate constant (Ka))) on average these equations were less accurate (&#x002B;23.1 to 549.6&#x0025;) that <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation 1</xref>. Again <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. shows that when the pharmacokinetic <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equations 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">5</xref> were used to estimate the dose taken (or administered) in deaths attributed to amitriptyline toxicity there was a very large overestimation of the dose that was taken with an overestimation of between &#x002B;127.6 &#x0025; and 2346.0 &#x0025;. The differences between the actual dose administered compared to the estimated dose administered seen in this study for the clinical group are likely to be due to individual variation in the pharmacokinetic factors as these are known to be person specific. The pharmacokinetic factors are influenced by age, sex, disease state, the physicochemical properties of the specific drug and genetics amongst other factors (for a review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>)). Even with the most investigated and understood forensically relevant drug, ethanol, there are still large contributing uncertainties from specific pharmacokinetic factors (such as the elimination rate and volume of distribution of ethanol (see reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) for summary) and as in the investigation in this work may only be generalised for the &#x201C;average&#x201D; person leading to increased uncertainty of the &#x201C;true&#x201D; value unless specifically measured in the individual. This something that is impossible in a deceased individual.</p>

<sec id="s1j">
<title>Postmortem changes and their influence on pharmacokinetic parameters</title>
<p>The changes in the postmortem environment of the body also increase the uncertainty for various of the variable in the pharmacokinetic equations. Postmortem redistribution is the phenomenon known as the &#x201C;toxicological nightmare&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Postmortem redistribution is the change in drug concentration at a specific sampling site after death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). It is more common for drug concentrations to increase after death at specific sampling sites (sometimes up to 10-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) but they can also decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>), thus there could be a large under (or overestimation) of the drug concentration at the time of death when compared to the measured postmortem drug concentration adding to the uncertainty of the actual blood concentration parameter used in pharmacokinetic equations. Femoral blood is the postmortem sample that is considered to be the &#x201C;least affected&#x201D; by postmortem redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), but recent studies suggest that popliteal blood may be a &#x201C;better&#x201D; sample to use than femoral blood(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). However, any postmortem sample is liable to be affected by postmortem redistribution. To date there are no markers to allow determination of the amount of postmortem redistribution that may, or may not have occurred since death and the time the blood is sampled. Thus, the uncertainty of the concentration of the drug will be likely be larger than used in this study (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The of half-life and volume of distribution of drugs are also likely be different in fatal drug intoxications compared to those observed in life. For example, the data in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> demonstrates that on average the elimination rate concentration decreases by about half in overdose cases when compared to clinical cases (from 0.046 &#x00B1; 0.031 h<sup>-1</sup> to 0.023 &#x00B1; 0.014 h<sup>-1</sup>) this is likely to decrease further in fatal intoxications as metabolic enzymes and other process become saturated and drug elimination move from 1<sup>st</sup> order to zero-order elimination. The mean volume of distribution measured in normal individuals is also likely to be different than that found in fatal intoxication cases as in the postmortem environment there are changes in pH (leading to changes in the ionisation of drugs) and drug partitioning (due to loss of cell membrane integrity) along with other changes such as cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Another factor that may be altered in fatal intoxications is that of absorption. The absorption of drugs from the stomach, and thus the bioavailability (F) of a drug, is also assumed to cease in the pharmacokinetic equations. However depending on the case circumstances this has been shown not to be the case especially where tables (or ethanol) reman in the stomach after death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The changes of these variables (volume of distribution, elimination rate (half-life), drug concentration and absorption (bioavailability)) in a specific individual leading up to and after death compared to normal healthy individuals is likely to be unknowable. As this study demonstrates these added uncertainties lead to poor accuracy and precision of postmortem dose estimations when compared to the actual doses consumed. The changes in the postmortem environment also make other calculations that are commonly carried out in ethanol forensics such as back-calculations (retrograde extrapolation) highly unreliable. Even in living individuals these calculation are likely to be unreliable due to the lack of large studies of the elimination rate and volume of distribution of specific drugs.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>As expected, both the uncertainty and the accuracy of the calculation of the dose of a drug administered (or taken) from a postmortem drug concentration are too large to allow reliable estimation of the dose of drug taken or administered prior to death. This work again reinforces that dose calculations from postmortem blood drug concentrations should not be carried out.</p>
