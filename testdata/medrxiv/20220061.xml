<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>OBJECTIVE</title>
<p>It is important to know if mortality among hospitalised covid-19 patients has changed as the pandemic has progressed. The aim of this study was to describe the dynamics of mortality among patients hospitalised for covid-19 in a nationwide study.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>DESIGN</title>
<p>Nationwide observational cohort study of all patients hospitalised in Sweden 1 March to 30 June 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity 14 days before to 5 days after admission, and a discharge code for covid-19.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>SETTING</title>
<p>All hospitals in Sweden.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>PARTICIPANTS</title>
<p>15 761 hospitalised patients with covid-19, with data compiled by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</title>
<p>Outcome was 60-day all-cause mortality. Patients were stratified according to month of hospital admission. Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk of death by month of admission, adjusting for pre-existing conditions, age, sex, care dependency, and severity of illness (Simplified Acute Physiology, version 3), for patients in intensive care units (ICU).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>The overall 60-day mortality was 17.8&#x0025; (95&#x0025; confidence interval (CI), 17.2&#x0025; to 18.4&#x0025;), and it decreased from 24.7&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI, 23.0&#x0025; to 26.5&#x0025;) in March to 13.3&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI, 12.1&#x0025; to 14.7&#x0025;) in June. Adjusted relative risk (RR) of death was 0.56 (95&#x0025; CI, 0.51 to 0.63) for June, using March as reference. Corresponding RR for patients not admitted to ICU and those admitted to ICU were 0.60 (95&#x0025; CI, 0.53 to 0.67) and 0.61 (95&#x0025; CI, 0.48 to 0.79), respectively. The proportion of patients admitted to ICU decreased from 19.5&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI, 17.9&#x0025; to 21.0&#x0025;) in the March cohort to 11.0&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI, 9.9&#x0025; to 12.2&#x0025;) in the June cohort.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>There was a gradual decline in mortality from March to June 2020 in Swedish hospitalised covid-19 patients, which was independent of pre-existing conditions, age, and sex. Future research is needed to explain the reasons for this decline. The changing covid-19 mortality should be taken into account when management and results of studies from the first pandemic wave are evaluated.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has put enormous pressure on the healthcare system in general and on hospitals in particular, despite extensive interventions to reduce spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Patients admitted for covid-19 have been reported to have mortality fractions of &#x2265;20&#x0025; overall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and of &#x003E;34&#x0025; among patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> The proportion of patients requiring ICU admission is reported to be 17-32&#x0025;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most studies on covid-19 mortality have included patients admitted between February and April 2020, i.e. early in the covid-19 pandemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there has been a gradual and substantial increase in our understanding of covid-19. This may have contributed to the improved survival that has been noted among ICU-treated covid-19 patients. In an ICU study of covid-19 patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by Doidge et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> a decline in 28-day mortality was noted from 43.5&#x0025; before the peak of the first pandemic wave to 34.3&#x0025; after the peak. A meta-analysis of Armstrong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> showed lower ICU mortalities in studies published April-May than in those published January-March. However, a large proportion of hospitalised covid-19 patients are never admitted to ICU, and to our knowledge it has not been clarified if mortality has changed among non-ICU treated hospitalised patients. Karagiannidis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> reported no considerable change in mortality over time in a large German cohort of unselected hospitalised covid-19 patients.</p>
<p>The present Swedish study was undertaken to examine whether mortality has changed with time in a nationwide cohort of hospitalised covid-19 patients. The specific aim was to evaluate nationwide 60-day mortality separately for non-ICU treated and ICU treated patients, during the first 4 months of the pandemic, using data compiled by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study population was derived from cross-linked national population-based registers using the unique personal identity number assigned to each Swedish resident at birth or on immigration to Sweden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the National Patient Register (NPR), held by the NBHW, all patients admitted to hospitals in Sweden between 1 March and 30 June, 2020 were identified, see flowchart in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">fig 1</xref>.Cross-linking with the Swedish reporting system for notifiable infectious diseases (SmiNet)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> provided data on SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results. Hospitalised patients with a PCR test result positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA 14 days before to 5 days after admission were then identified. Finally, those with a discharge code of covid-19, i.e. U07.1 according to the <italic>10</italic><sup><italic>th</italic></sup> <italic>International Statistical Classification of Diseases</italic> (ICD-10), (n=15 761) constituted the study population of the present study.</p>

<title>Outcome and covariate data</title>
<p>Primary outcome was 60-day mortality, defined as death from any cause within 60 days of index hospital admission. Sixty days was considered to be a reasonable follow-up time since very few patients remain in hospital for longer periods, but patients in ICU often remain hospitalised beyond 30 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Date of death was obtained from the Swedish Cause of Death Register<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> (held by NBHW). Since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, the register has been updated daily with all dates of death, as reported to the Swedish Tax Agency (mandatory reporting by law), resulting in no loss to follow-up.</p>
<p>ICU episodes were identified from the Swedish Intensive Care Registry, a national quality register for intensive care in Sweden including 83 of 84 ICUs in the country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Since the outbreak of the pandemic the register has had complete coverage of all ICU treated covid-19 patients in Sweden.</p>
<p>In the present study, patients were stratified according to month of admission, in line with the Swedish epidemiological curve of new admission for covid-19 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">fig 2</xref>), i.e. rapid increase in admission rate in March, relatively stable high admission rate in April, relatively stable moderately high admission rate in May, and decreasing admission rate in June. The date of index admission for each patient was defined as the admission date of the first hospital care episode that fitted the inclusion criteria.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="20220061v1_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To account for patient transfer within or between hospitals, resulting in multiple entries in the NPR, duration of hospital stay was defined as number of days between index admission date and last discharge date in cases with sequential admissions. A sequential admission was defined as a readmission occurring within 1 day of the previous one, starting with the index admission. Duration of hospital stay in days was compared using the outcome discharge status (alive/deceased) rather than 60-day mortality, to avoid truncating one group at 60 days by default.</p>
<p>Comorbidities were defined using discharge diagnoses for the last five years and/or prescribed drugs dispensed during the year preceding index admission. A 30-day wash-out window prior to index admission date was applied. Codes defining each comorbidity are provided in table E1. In addition, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was calculated as described in table E2.</p>
<p>Information on discharge diagnoses were identified through the NPR, which contains information on all reported cases of inpatient care and/or visits to a physician at a specialised outpatient clinic in Sweden. The validity of the register is generally high with positive predictive values of 85&#x0025; to 95&#x0025; for most diagnoses in validation studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data on drugs dispensed were obtained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register (held by NBHW), which contains all prescribed and pharmacy-dispensed medicines in the community classified according to the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC). It has almost complete coverage (data missing &#x003C;1&#x0025;).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Information on care dependency (nursing home resident or homecare) prior to admission was obtained from the Care and Social Services for the Elderly and for Persons with Impairments Register (held by NBHW). Date and country of birth were obtained from the NPR.</p>
<p>Data on Simplified Acute Physiology, version 3 (SAPS3), oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2), treatments and procedures on the ICU were obtained from the Swedish Intensive Care Registry. For SAPS3 and PaO2/FiO2, information from the first admission only was used. If a patient had several ICU admissions, treatment information was retrieved for all episodes of ICU care for covid-19.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Baseline patient characteristics were tabulated by month of admission, ICU treatment and survival outcome. Confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for proportions using the Wilson Score interval and expressed as percentages.</p>
<p>Crude survival curves with 95&#x0025; Hall-Wellner confidence bands were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, plotted by month of admission with all-cause mortality as event. Follow-up was truncated at 60 days after index admission. The log-rank test was used to test for differences in survival between groups, with a two-sided alpha of 0.05.</p>
<p>Furthermore, percentage mortalities were plotted by month of admission, overall, by age groups (&#x003C;60, 60-69, 70-79, &#x2265;80), sex, and healthcare region.</p>
<p>Incident number of covid-19 patients admitted to hospital per day was plotted by index admission date for the whole patient cohort as well as separately for ICU, using the first occurring ICU admission date for a patient. The number of covid-19 patients residing in hospital care per day was also calculated, again showing one curve for the overall cohort and one for the ICU treated cohort separately. Lines were smoothed using a seven-day rolling average, based on three days prior-three days after admission.</p>
<p>Relative risk (RR) with 95&#x0025; CI was estimated in multivariable analysis for the outcome 60-day mortality with month of hospitalisation as exposure of interest, using modified Poisson regression models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Estimates of RR were obtained from three models: Model 1 adjusted for age (continuous, both a linear and quadratic term), sex (male/female), CCI (categorical, 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5&#x002B;), care dependency (nursing home, homecare, neither), country of birth (Sweden/other), and healthcare region (North, Uppsala-&#x00D6;rebro, Stockholm-Gotland, Southeast, West, and South). Model 2 additionally included an interaction term between month of admission and healthcare region. Model 3 estimated age as a categorical variable (&#x003C;60, 60-69, 70-79, &#x2265;80) for increased interpretability, and included an interaction term between month of admission and age group.</p>
<p>Model 1 was also stratified between ICU admission or not during the hospital episode. In cases of ICU care, the SAPS3 score (continuous) for the first ICU episode was added, creating Model 4.</p>
<p>In all regression models, missing data were handled by complete case analysis. Data were complete on all variables except for country of birth and CCI (5&#x0025; missing) and SAPS3 (&#x003C;1&#x0025; missing). Sensitivity analyses were performed comparing adjusted RR when imputing missing country of birth to &#x2018;Sweden&#x2019; or &#x2018;Outside Sweden&#x2019;, and when imputing missing CCI to extreme values &#x2018;0&#x2019; or &#x2018;5&#x002B;&#x2019;.</p>
<p>All data management and statistical analyses were performed using SAS Software SAS Enterprise guide v7.15, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC.</p>

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Altogether, 15 761 patients admitted for covid-19 in Swedish hospitals were studied, median age 64 years (interquartile range, 51 to 78 years), 57.5&#x0025; men and 42.5&#x0025; women. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> shows the number of new hospital admissions and the total numbers of in-patients on each time point. The peak numbers of patients admitted and in hospital care occurred during April. The proportion of patients admitted to ICU was 14.4&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI, 13.9&#x0025; to 15.0&#x0025;).</p>
<p>Patient characteristics, stratified according to month of admission, are shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. The proportion of men decreased from 60.1&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI, 58.1&#x0025; to 62.1&#x0025;) in March to 54.2&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI, 52.4&#x0025; to 56.1&#x0025;) in June. Age distribution changed over time with the number of patients &#x003C; 40 years and &#x003E; 90 years increasing between March and June. The proportion of patients with a CCI of zero was 58.1&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI, 56.1&#x0025; to 60.1&#x0025;) in March and 63.7&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI, 61.9&#x0025; to 65.5&#x0025;) in June. In March 42.2&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI, 40.2&#x0025; to 44.2&#x0025;) of patients were born outside Sweden compared to 33.7&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI 32.0&#x0025; to 35.5&#x0025;) in June.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present nationwide study on patients hospitalised for covid-19 in Sweden showed a distinct gradual decline in 60-day mortality between March and June both for non-ICU treated and ICU treated patients. The results were stable after adjustment for pre-existing conditions, age, sex, level of care dependency, country of birth, healthcare region, and SAPS3 (ICU treated patients).</p>
<p>The mortalities of 17.9&#x0025; among hospitalised covid-19 patients overall and 25.5&#x0025; among ICU treated covid-19 patients were low compared to reported mortalities from other countries, i.e. &#x2265; 20&#x0025;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and &#x003E; 34&#x0025;,<sup>2,6-8</sup> respectively. Reasons for differences in outcome are difficult to analyse since studies use different outcome definitions, provide different patient characteristics, and often include patients that are still treated in hospital. Importantly, the time period of inclusion is probably crucial for the overall mortality and for differences between studies, since the mortality has clearly been changing over time. In the present study, the overall 60-day mortality declined from 24.7&#x0025; in March to 13.3&#x0025; in June, it declined from 36.1&#x0025; to 20.1&#x0025; among ICU treated patients, and from 21.9&#x0025; to 12.5&#x0025; among non-ICU treated patients. However, as noted in fig E6, the mortality dynamics over time varied between the Swedish healthcare regions. The reasons for these variations are not known, but a number of factors may have contributed to those and to the overall decline in mortality.</p>
<p>First, improvements of management and care have probably been of great importance for the declining mortality. For instance, the present study shows that even though acute severity of illness (SAPS3) among ICU-treated patients remained unchanged over time, the proportion of patients managed in the prone position increased, and the proportion receiving invasive mechanical ventilation decreased (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>During the study period the drug therapy of patients with covid-19 changed continuously. In March 2020, many covid-19 patients in Sweden received off-label treatment with chloroquine phosphate/hydroxychloroquine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> until this use was stopped by the European Medicines Agency on April 1. However, this use may not have affected outcome, since a randomised control trial (RCT) by Horby et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> found that patients treated with hydroxychloroquine had similar mortality as those receiving standard of care treatment. In March and early April, publications showed that anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was associated with a better prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and that thromboembolic events occurred despite standard doses thromboprophylaxis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Accordingly, high-dose LMWH treatment became standard in Swedish ICUs in April. We are still awaiting the results of ongoing RCT of LMWH at different doses (NCT04345848; NCT04344756)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, so we do not yet know the impact of high-dose LMWH on outcome. Corticosteroids became standard care for covid-19 patients requiring oxygen therapy after June 16, when the RECOVERY RCT showed survival benefits from corticosteroids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Prior to that, corticosteroids were predominantly used on the ICU, and their use increased over the study period (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). However, the infrequent use of corticosteroid treatment in March-May suggests that corticosteroids were unlikely to be a major cause for the decline in mortality among ICU patients.</p>
<p>Second, the high load of new admissions and of patients in hospital care for covid-19 in March and April (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">fig 2</xref>) may have contributed to the high initial mortality. This notion is supported by the result from healthcare region Stockholm-Gotland, which had the highest number of new covid-19 admissions/population in March-April (table E4) and also the clearest decline in mortality (fig E6).</p>
<p>Third, the decline in mortality may have been due to a change in the selection of covid-19 patients for hospital care. Among hospitalised covid-19 patients in the present study, the proportion admitted to ICU and receiving invasive mechanical ventilation decreased substantially over time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">fig 6</xref>). In addition, the proportion of patients without comorbidity (CCI zero) increased significantly over time. These aspects indicate that the overall hospitalised covid-19 population was gradually less severely ill. This explanation is supported by an Italian study of covid-19 patients diagnosed in the emergency department between March and May, showing that the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract gradually decreased and the proportion of patients requiring ICU care decreased over time.</p>
<p><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>Fourth, the decline in mortality could perhaps be due to changes in virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Young et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> showed that a major deletion in the SARS-CoV-2 genome was associated with milder infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Among 521 virus strains in Sweden with complete genome sequences, 19 different SARS-CoV-2 strain sequences were identified, 11 of which were identified in strains collected in March only.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> It will be important to investigate if the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strains in May and June had an inherent reduced virulence or had undergone genetic changes that reduced virulence.</p>
<p>The results of the present study, showing declining mortality over time in both non-ICU treated and ICU treated patients, combined with some previous studies showing declining mortality among ICU treated patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, shed new light on covid-19 mortality and enables a more appropriate evaluation of the management of the pandemic. For instance, in studies using mortality as endpoint, the timing of inclusion may play a crucial role regarding outcome. The results of before-and-after studies on specific interventions should thus be interpreted with caution. The impact of an intervention during a high-mortality period does not necessarily apply to the same intervention during a period with significantly lower mortality. This is important when planning for allocation of healthcare resources to meet the next phases of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The present study has a number of strengths. First, it was a nationwide study including all hospitals in Sweden, minimising risk of selection bias. Second, it was based on national registers with standardised reporting on a national level, minimising bias of ascertainment. The unique national personal identification number of all Swedish residents enabled cross-linkage of registers at the individual level. Third, the inclusion of both non-ICU treated and ICU treated patients enabled analyses of the full nationwide cohort of hospitalised covid-19 patients. Fourth, the use of 60-day mortality provided a robust outcome measure with a follow-up long enough to enable hospital discharge of most patients.</p>
<p>The study also has limitations. First, clinical data regarding organ function were not available for non-ICU treated patients. Thus, it was not possible to determine degree of respiratory failure within the whole cohort. Second, data on do-not-resuscitate orders were not available and thus, it is not known if criteria for admission to ICU changed with time. However, SAPS3 scores on ICU admission were constant throughout the study period, indicating that the criteria for ICU admission had probably not changed considerably. Third, we did not have access to data on drug therapy on wards during hospital stay, and thus we could not appropriately assess the impact of different drug therapy for outcome. Fourth, the NPR lacks information from primary care, hence the CCI may be underestimated. However, replacing CCI with the individual comorbidities measured from both the NPR and the Prescribed Drug Register (thus catching primary care) in the models did not attenuate RR estimates further (not shown).</p>
<p>In conclusion, there was a distinct gradual decline in mortality for both non-ICU treated and ICU treated hospitalised covid-19 patients. Future studies are needed to address and explain this decline. The changing covid-19 mortality should be considered when the management and results of studies from the first pandemic wave are evaluated.</p>
