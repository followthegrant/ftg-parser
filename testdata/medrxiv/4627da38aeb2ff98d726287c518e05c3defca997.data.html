<meta name="DC.Description" content="Background It is important to understand the spectrum of pulmonary diseases that patients are presenting after recovery from initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to study small airway disease and changes in Computed Tomography (CT)and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with time.

Methods This is retrospective observation study including adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with at-least two CT scans either during acute (defined as &lt;1 month) or subacute (1-3 months) or chronic (&gt;3months) phase after positive test. Radiological features and follow up PFTs were obtained.

Results 22 patients met the inclusion criteria with mean age 57.6 years (range 36-83). Out of these,18 (81.81%) were hospitalized. Mean duration of diagnosis to CT and PFT was 192.68(112-385) days and 161.54(31-259) days respectively. On PFTs, restrictive pulmonary physiology was predominant finding during subacute 56.25% (9/16) and chronic phases 47% (7/15). PFTs improved significantly with time {FEV1((p=0.0361), FVC (p=0.0341), FEF 25%-75% (p=0.0259) and DLCO (p=0.0019)}, but there was persistent air trapping in the expiratory chronic phase CT. There was resolution of ground glass opacity, consolidation, and bronchiectasis however air trapping increased with time in 41.61% (10/21) of subacute CTs compared to 81.25% (13/16) in chronic CTs.

Conclusion Our study shows evidence of airway as well as parenchymal disease as relatively long-term sequel of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also highlights the natural course and spontaneous recovery of some radiological and pulmonary function test abnormalities over time with evidence of persistent small airway disease (air trapping) on expiratory CT imaging months after infection.

Highlights 

1.  Long term pulmonary complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection include small airway disease

2.  There is role of inspiratory and expiratory Computed tomography (CT) scan to identify air trapping in patients with persistent respiratory symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection

3.  Normal spirometry and normal routine CT may not be sufficient to characterize and identify cause of persistent respiratory complains in patients after COVID-19

4.  This study highlights persistent parenchymal and physiological airway abnormalities more than six months after recovery from initial SARS-CoV-2 infection

We aim to study small airway disease and changes in Computed Tomography (CT)and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with time.</p></div><div id="sec-2" class="subsection"><p id="p-3"><strong>Methods</strong> This is retrospective observation study including adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with at-least two CT scans either during acute (defined as &lt;1 month) or subacute (1-3 months) or chronic (&gt;3months) phase after positive test. Radiological features and follow up PFTs were obtained.</p></div><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><p id="p-4"><strong>Results</strong> 22 patients met the inclusion criteria with mean age 57.6 years (range 36-83). Out of these,18 (81.81%) were hospitalized. Mean duration of diagnosis to CT and PFT was 192.68(112-385) days and 161.54(31-259) days respectively. On PFTs, restrictive pulmonary physiology was predominant finding during subacute 56.25% (9/16) and chronic phases 47% (7/15). PFTs improved significantly with time {FEV1((p=0.0361), FVC (p=0.0341), FEF 25%-75% (p=0.0259) and DLCO (p=0.0019)}, but there was persistent air trapping in the expiratory chronic phase CT. There was resolution of ground glass opacity, consolidation, and bronchiectasis however air trapping increased with time in 41.61% (10/21) of subacute CTs compared to 81.25% (13/16) in chronic CTs.</p></div><div id="sec-4" class="subsection"><p id="p-5"><strong>Conclusion</strong> Our study shows evidence of airway as well as parenchymal disease as relatively long-term sequel of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also highlights the natural course and spontaneous recovery of some radiological and pulmonary function test abnormalities over time with evidence of persistent small airway disease (air trapping) on expiratory CT imaging months after infection.</p></div><div id="sec-5" class="subsection"><p><strong>Highlights</strong></p><ol class="list-ord " id="list-1"><li id="list-item-1"><p id="p-6">Long term pulmonary complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection include small airway disease</p></li><li id="list-item-2"><p id="p-7">There is role of inspiratory and expiratory Computed tomography (CT) scan to identify air trapping in patients with persistent respiratory symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection</p></li><li id="list-item-3"><p id="p-8">Normal spirometry and normal routine CT may not be sufficient to characterize and identify cause of persistent respiratory complains in patients after COVID-19</p></li><li id="list-item-4"><p id="p-9">This study highlights persistent parenchymal and physiological airway abnormalities more than six months after recovery from initial SARS-CoV-2 infection</p></li></ol></div></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-10">The authors have declared no competing interest.</p><h3>Funding Statement</h3><p id="p-11">This study did not receive any funding</p><h3>Author Declarations</h3><p id="p-12">I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.</p><p id="p-13">Yes</p><p id="p-14">The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:</p><p id="p-15">IRB of University of Iowa gave ethical approval for this work</p><p id="p-16">I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.</p><p id="p-17">Yes</p><p id="p-18">I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
