<title>BACKGROUND</title>
<p>Monitoring trajectories of intrinsic capacity (IC) in older adults has been suggested by the WHO as a means to inform prevention to avoid or delay negative health outcomes. Due to a lack of longitudinal studies, it is currently unclear how IC changes over time and whether repeatedly measured IC predicts negative health outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>METHODS</title>
<p>Based on 4,751 repeated observations of IC (range=0-100) during 21 years of follow-up among 754 older adults 70&#x002B; years, we assessed longitudinal trajectories of IC, and whether time-varying IC predicted the risk of chronic ADL disability, long-term nursing home stay, and mortality using joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>Average IC declined progressively from 77 to 11 points during follow-up, with substantial heterogeneity between older adults. Adjusted for socio-demographics and chronic diseases, a one-point lower IC value was associated with a 7&#x0025; increase in the risk of ADL disability, a 6&#x0025; increase in the risk of a nursing home stay, and a 5&#x0025; increase in mortality. Accuracy for 5- and 10-year predictions based on up to three repeated measurements of IC ranged between moderate and good (AUC = 0.76-0.82).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Our study indicates that IC declines progressively and that it predicts negative health outcomes among older adults. Therefore, regular monitoring of IC could work as an early warning system informing preventive efforts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In a shift from a disease-oriented to a functioning- and life-course-oriented approach of healthy aging, the World Health Organization (WHO)[<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] introduced the construct of intrinsic capacity (IC), which is defined as a composite measure of a person&#x2019;s physical and mental capacities. IC is conceptualized as a dynamic construct[<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] comprised by five domains (vitality, locomotor, sensory, cognitive, and psychological)[<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Based on fine-grained measurements and regular monitoring, it may be possible to detect declines in IC ahead of clinical manifestations. This could facilitate the development and testing of preventive interventions to avoid, attenuate or delay the onset of geriatric syndromes and subsequent health care utilization.</p>
<p>Although there is solid evidence[<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that indicators associated with IC-domains such as grip strength (vitality) or gait speed (locomotor) predict adverse health outcomes, few studies, to date[<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], have assessed the predictive ability of the overall IC construct. Moreover, these studies were either cross-sectional[<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], or assessed only the association of between-person differences in IC at baseline with the incidence of disability in activities of daily living (ADL)[<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and mortality[<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, it is currently unclear how IC changes over time and whether longitudinal monitoring of IC is informative with regard to the prediction of negative health outcomes. This knowledge is required if IC is to act as an early warning system informing preventive efforts. The aim of this study is therefore to measure changes in IC longitudinally, and to assess whether repeatedly measured IC predicts three negative health outcomes (ADL disability, nursing home stay, and mortality) among community-dwelling older adults.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Data</title>
<p>In the Yale PEP Study[<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], monthly telephone interviews and comprehensive home-based face-to-face assessments at 18-month intervals have been conducted since 1998 among 754 community-dwelling health plan members from greater New Haven, Connecticut (US). Eligible participants were aged 70 years or older, and without ADL disability at baseline. For the current study, we used follow-up data through June 2019 (21 years).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Variables</title>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Intrinsic capacity</title>
<p>IC was monitored based on the 18-months assessments, which amounted to a total of 4,751 repeated observations (6.5 observations of IC per person on average). IC was measured via its five domains. (1) <italic>Vitality</italic> was operationalized via muscle strength and respiratory functioning. Muscle strength was assessed by mean hand grip strength (kg) over three readings with a hand-held Chatillon 100 dynamometer. Respiratory functioning was assessed with the maximum peak expiratory flow value (liter/min) over three attempts measured with a Mini-Wright meter. (2) <italic>Locomotor</italic> was assessed with gait speed (in seconds) tested across a 20-foot walk with a turn, the time required to perform three stands in the chair-rising test (in seconds), and the balance test (tandem, semi-tandem, side-by-side, 0-4 points) from the short physical performance battery. (3) The <italic>sensory</italic> domain included near-vision acuity, which was measured with a Jaeger chart (impairment in &#x0025;), and hearing impairment, which was measured with an Audioscope (impairment in &#x0025;). (4) <italic>Cognition</italic> was measured with the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (MMSE, range=0-30), and (5) the <italic>psychological</italic> domain was measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D, range=0-11). Input variables were rescaled after stratification by sex with the percent of maximum possible method[<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], so that values were comparable longitudinally[<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and ranged from 0 (minimum possible) to 100 (maximum possible). We computed IC in each wave by first calculating a meanscore for domains with multiple indicators (vitality, locomotor) before calculating a meanscore over all five domains. Finally, the obtained meanscore values of IC were again re-scaled so that they ranged from 0-100.</p>
<p>Internal consistency reliability and construct validity of IC was assessed with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), where we tested a second-order and a bi-factor model[<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], with the latter providing the better model fit. We removed hearing impairment due to low correlation (r&#x003C;.10) to all other IC input variables which led to problematic negative variances in the CFA. Without hearing impairment, maximum-likelihood estimation with robust standard errors via R-package <italic>lavaan</italic> yielded a very good fit for the bi-factor model: e.g. at baseline <italic>&#x03C7;</italic><sup>2</sup>(16)=23.56, RMSEA=0.03, CFI=0.99, TLI=0.99, SRMR=0.02. Reliability of the IC as a general factor ranged between acceptable (e.g. at baseline: hierarchical <italic>&#x03C9;</italic>=0.71) to good (e.g. at 7.5 years: hierarchical <italic>&#x03C9;</italic>=0.86) during follow-up. The correlation between the extracted IC factor scores and the IC meanscores which were used in the further analysis was high (r=0.93-0.96) throughout follow-up.</p>

<sec id="s2b2">
<title>Negative health outcomes</title>
<p>Negative health outcomes included (1) onset of chronic ADL disability[<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (need for personal assistance in either dressing, bathing, walking inside the house, or transferring from a chair) lasting at least three months, (2) long-term (3&#x002B; months) nursing home stay (NHS), and (3) mortality (MOR). ADL and NHS were assessed via monthly telephone interviews, MOR was determined from local obituaries and informants (100&#x0025; complete). For each outcome, a time-line was created, with the first interview marking the beginning of the observation period until either the time of the outcome, the end of follow-up, or dropout for other reasons, whatever came first.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b3">
<title>Additional predictor variables</title>
<p>These included sex (men/women), 12 or more years of education (no/yes), age at baseline (years), ethnicity (white/non-white) and the number of chronic diseases at baseline (range=0-9).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>To predict the negative health outcomes, we used joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data[<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], an advanced statistical approach where effects of time-varying predictors on time-to-event outcomes are estimated based on their longitudinal characteristics captured with mixed-effects regression models. In contrast to the extended Cox-models for time-dependent predictors, joint models are better suited to handle both incomplete follow-up data and noisy information in time-varying covariates. In the mixed regression sub-model, we first compared different specifications of time according to goodness-of-fit measures (AIC, BIC, LRT-Test) to correctly characterize population- and individual-level IC trajectories[<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The best fit was obtained with a restricted natural cubic spline with one internal knot placed at the median of the follow-up time capturing non-linear population- and individual-level trajectories of IC. The survival regression sub-model was formulated as:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21257829v1_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where the risk of an adverse health outcome <italic>h</italic> for individual <italic>i</italic> at time <italic>t</italic> depends on the baseline hazard function <italic>h</italic><sub>0</sub> estimated with a cubic-spline (five knots), the regression coefficients <italic>&#x03B3;</italic><sub>1&#x2212;5</sub> of the time-constant predictors, and the association parameter <italic>&#x03B1;</italic>. For <italic>&#x03B1;</italic>, we used the current value parametrization, i.e. the &#x2018;true&#x2019; value of IC based on the individual-level growth model at <italic>t</italic> as a time-varying predictor. To assess the predictive performance, we calculated time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values using information on IC up to the third year and medium (5 years) and long-term (10 years) prediction windows. AUC values were corrected for overfitting with an internal validation procedure using bootstrap[<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Joint models were fitted using R-package JMbayes (v0.8-85), and all calculations were done in R: A language and environment for statistical computing (v4.0.3).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>At baseline, average age was 78.4 (SD=5.3, range=70-96) years; 67.1&#x0025; of the sample were women, 89.5&#x0025; identified as white, 68.3&#x0025; had 12 or more years of education, and the median number of chronic diseases reported was 2 (IQR=1). The distribution of IC values at baseline was skewed to the left, i.e. most older adults had initially high levels of IC (Plot A in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The mean IC at baseline was 77 (SD=11), which declined progressively to 11 points at the end of follow-up (Plot B in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> also shows that there was substantial variance between participants (thin grey lines), which increased during follow-up: e.g. IQR at baseline=14, after 6 years=21, and after 12 years=23. Participants who developed chronic ADL disability, who were admitted to a nursing home, or who died during follow-up exhibited faster deterioration in IC on average, relative to those who did not develop the specific outcome (Plot A in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Older adults with below-average IC at baseline also had a higher risk of negative health outcomes compared to those with above-average baseline-IC (Plot B in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>During follow-up, 61.4&#x0025; of the participants reported the onset of chronic ADL disability after a median of 5.8 years (IQR=8.1), 42.7&#x0025; were admitted to a nursing home after a median of 7.3 (IQR=8.8) years, and 93.1&#x0025; eventually died after a median of 9.4 (IQR=8.6) years. The results from the joint models, adjusted for socio-demographics and chronic diseases, (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) indicate that a one-point lower IC (on scale 0-100) was associated with an 7&#x0025; (=1/0.94) increase in the risk for ADL (95&#x0025; CI: 1.06-1.07), a 6&#x0025; increase in the risk for NHS (95&#x0025; CI: 1.05-1.07), and a 5&#x0025; increase in the risk of death (95&#x0025; CI: 1.04-1.05). The AUC-values indicate that IC, together with information on socio-demographics and chronic diseases, has good discriminative power predicting future negative health outcomes (5-year AUC: ADL=0.81, NHS=0.80, MOR=0.76; 10-year AUC: ADL=0.82, NHS=0.81, MOR=0.76). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows how individual predictions are updated as additional values of IC become available. To illustrate, we selected three female participants aged 74, 81, and 77 years at baseline, of whom B and C developed chronic ADL disability after 11 and 12 years of follow-up, respectively. Their baseline IC values and their IC-trajectories varied considerably, as did their predicted outcome probabilities at different time points. The sharp decline of IC in participant C over time, for example, results in an ever more certain and lower probability to remain free from chronic ADL disability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>IC has been suggested as a fine-grained, comprehensive measure of overall health status to monitor minor health declines in older individuals and populations in order to intervene and subsequently avoid or delay further major health declines. Based on extensive longitudinal data covering more than 20 years among 754 older adults (70&#x002B;), we showed in this report that IC declined progressively in later life, and that regularly monitoring of IC can predict future negative health outcomes, particularly the onset of chronic ADL disability and NHS, a proxy for severe long-term care needs. These results suggest that monitoring IC could help to target older persons with a heightened risk of care-dependency for preventive interventions.</p>
<p>In the current study, we found that, on average, IC declined progressively over time. However, it is important to keep the substantial between-person heterogeneity around this average trajectory in mind: participants entered the study with broadly varying levels of IC, and IC-trajectories during follow-up varied from stability and even some improvements to drastic declines within a few years. What is more, the between-person variance in IC increased during follow-up. Plans to develop normative trajectories of IC &#x2013; to identify individual deviations from normality &#x2013; for preventive actions[<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] should pay attention to this increasing heterogeneity. In our analysis, we measured IC up to 13 times per person at 18-months intervals. Assessments of IC among older adults during annual health check-ups could provide even more timely information to better tailor diagnostic and therapeutic decisions without additionally taxing routine medical care.</p>
<p>Our study is the first attempt to predict negative health outcomes based on repeatedly measured IC. Whereas previous studies relied on one-time assessments of IC[<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we could show that IC declines progressively and the current (or last) IC value predicts future negative health outcomes. The IC therefore could be used to predict probabilities for medium- and long-term negative health outcomes dynamically and to update prognoses, which may act as an early warning system and support medical decision making.</p>
<p>IC has been discussed[<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] as a concept complementary to or leading up to phenotypic frailty[<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, there is a potentially problematic overlap in some of the indicators of frailty and IC (i.e. gait speed, grip strength, items on exhaustion from CES-D), which precluded the inclusion of (pre-)frailty as a negative health outcome in our study. IC also shares a number of characteristics with the other main model of frailty, namely the health deficit accumulation approach and its frailty index (FI)[<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Both FI and IC are multidimensional &#x2013; i.e. including information about physical, cognitive and mental health &#x2013; and continuous indicators of overall health that can be measured repeatedly to assess longitudinal trajectories in the general older population (e.g.[<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). Interestingly, the FI, which is based on 30&#x002B; dichotomized health deficits, typically exhibits a right-skewed distribution in community-dwelling samples of older adults, whereas IC values &#x2013; which are based on fewer but continuous measurements of functioning &#x2013; exhibited a left-skew in our study. Future studies should compare the predictive performance of the FI and IC for negative health outcomes, considering also the more established conceptual framework and the more straightforward calculation of the FI.</p>
<p>In our analysis, we used joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data which have two major benefits over extended Cox-regression models. First, the mixed regression sub-model provides unbiased population-level estimates of IC trajectories by making use of all available observations. Second, the joint model approach can handle measurement error in the time-varying predictor. A recent simulation study[<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed, that when there is a considerable level of measurement error in the time-varying predictor as found in our study by the <italic>&#x03C9;</italic>-coefficients of IC, joint models provide more accurate estimates compared to the down-biased coefficients from Cox-regression models.</p>
<p>Strengths of this analysis include the long follow-up period and the high number of repeated observations of IC, the use of continuous indicators and assessment of reliability and construct validity of IC, and the statistical approach which accounted for non-linear trajectories of IC, the measurement error in IC, and which yield population-level and individual-level predictions. However, there are also several limitations to this research. First, there is no consensus yet on how to measure IC, with regard both to the selection of indicators[<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and how to calculate, rescale, or validate the summary measure of IC. In this study, we used similar indicators &#x2013; although no biomarkers were available &#x2013; and also a bi-factor model as Beard et al.[<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to operationalize IC. However, hearing impairment would not fit into our model, and thus, the domain sensory included only near-vision acuity. Also, there was a considerable level of measurement error in IC, which calls for further clarification of the conceptual model and the measurement strategy. Second, we focused on the overall construct of IC in this study, although our understanding of changes in IC and of potential targets for prevention and treatment could benefit also from assessing the co-evolution of the constituting dimensions of IC over time. Also, different domains likely exhibit different dynamics, e.g. mood likely changes faster or fluctuates compared to more gradual declines in sensory functioning. Third, our data did not include young older adults (50-70 years old), who might be a more appropriate target population for long-term prevention efforts. Fourth, the study participants were members of a single regional health plan 70 years or older who were initially non-disabled. Hence, our results might not be generalizable to the older U.S. population.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study indicates that IC declines progressively and that regular monitoring of intrinsic capacity can predict negative health outcomes among older adults. IC could therefore work as an early warning system informing preventive efforts. However, more research is needed to improve the conceptual foundations and measurement of IC before routine monitoring can be implemented.</p>
