<title>Abstract</title><p>COVID-19 is a huge threat to global health. Due to the lack of definitive etiological therapeutics currently, effective disease monitoring is of high clinical value for better healthcare and management of the large number of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we recruited 37 COVID-19 patients, collected 176 blood samples upon diagnosis and during treatment, and analyzed cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in these samples. We report gross abnormalities in cfDNA of COVID-19 patients, including elevated GC content, altered molecule size and end motif patterns. More importantly, such cfDNA characteristics reflect patient-specific physiological conditions during treatment. Further analysis on tissue origin tracing of cfDNA reveals frequent tissue injuries in COVID-19 patients, which is supported by clinical diagnoses. Hence, we demonstrate the translational merit of cfDNA as valuable analyte for effective disease monitoring, as well as tissue injury assessment in COVID-19 patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The current pandemic, COVID-19, has become a huge threat to global health: as many as 130 million patients had been diagnosed worldwide by early-Apr 2021. At present, there is no effective etiological treatment for COVID-19, and the number of diagnosed patients increases rapidly. Considering the tremendous amount of COVID-19 patients, disease monitoring is of particular clinical value for better management of these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>); however, efficient approaches are still limited. Since the pathogen of COVID-19 is a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), nucleic acid test of the pathogenic virus has become a standard method for diagnosis, treatment monitoring and cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Most patients turn negative for the nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 several weeks after treatment, but some patients show persistent viral shedding with low IgG antibody response. Considering that many asymptomatic and discharged patients are also positive for SARS-CoV-2 test, additional diagnostic approaches are thus needed for better disease monitoring of the patients. Furthermore, as evidenced in multiple investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), COVID-19 causes damages to various organs including lungs, the primary infected tissue, as well as heart, kidney, and brain. Such damage could further induce organ failures, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome and even patient mortality. Hence, to take early intervention measurements to prevent the occurrence of serious complications of the patients, it is of particular importance and urgent clinical need to develop methods for disease monitoring and organ injury assessment of COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in peripheral blood has been discovered and actively studied for more than 70 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). CfDNA molecules are mostly derived from dying cells and retain various cell-type-specific signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Numerous studies have demonstrated that cfDNA is a valuable analyte for diagnosis and monitoring of various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). In healthy subjects, cfDNA mostly originate from the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>); while in organ transplantation and cancer patients, cfDNA molecules released from the affected organs are readily detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Moreover, cfDNA molecules are rapidly cleared with a short half-life time (typically a few hours) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), thus reflect the real-time responses of the human body. The successful applications of plasma cfDNA in various physiological and pathological conditions suggest that these molecules may promise a practical and efficient approach for COVID-19 monitoring; however, comprehensive investigations have not been explored yet.</p>
<p>In this study, we have utilized plasma cfDNA to investigate the disease dynamics of COVID-19 patients during treatment. We have collected and analyzed a total of 208 blood samples from 37 COVID-19 patients and 32 controls. We report gross abnormalities, dynamics as well as organ injury signals in cfDNA, demonstrating high clinical potential of these analytes for effective disease monitoring and tissue injury assessment of COVID-19.</p>

<title>Overview of the study</title>
<p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the overall design of this study. A total of 37 COVID-19 patients, either in mild (N&#x003D;18) or severe (N&#x003D;19) conditions, were recruited from local hospitals in Guangdong province of China. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the major clinical characteristics of these patients. Briefly, in the COVID-19 patients, severe cases suffer from acute severe viral pneumonia and show serious clinical symptoms that require mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit treatment, while mild cases show weak symptoms of pneumonia (usually minor upper respiratory tract infection) and recover within a few weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). All the COVID-19 patients are immediately hospitalized upon diagnosis; for all COVID-19 patients, the first blood-collection timepoints are within 3 days after diagnosis. All COVID-19 patients receive standard treatment following the &#x201C;Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 5)&#x201D; guidelines published by National Health Commission &#x0026; National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China. In short, all COVID-19 patients receive antiviral treatment; severe patients receive additional antibacterial treatment, and most of them also receive antifungal treatment (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Notably, 1 severe patient also receives convalescent plasma therapy (Focosi et al. 2020; National Health Commission &#x0026; National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine 2020) on day 16 of hospitalization. The most common comorbidity in the COVID-19 patients is hypertension (4 and 6 in mild and severe groups, respectively), followed by type-II diabetes (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A total of 176 blood samples were collected at multiple timepoints upon hospitalization and during treatment. In addition, 32 age-matched non-COVID-19 controls were also recruited. CfDNA from all blood samples were investigated. Key clinical data, including SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin (i.e., IgG and IgM) levels, Chest X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT) scan, coagulation profile, liver and renal functions, electrolyte, myocardial enzymes, interleukin-6, TNF-&#x03B1;, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels, were also collected (when available) during treatment to analyze the disease states of the patients. The plasma cfDNA was extracted, sequenced, and analyzed to investigate their correlations with COVID-19 as well as dynamics during treatment.</p>

<title>Abnormalities in cfDNA of COVID-19 patients</title>
<p>In a previous work, we found that SARS-CoV-2-derived DNA does not present in the plasma of COVID-19 patients (which is in consistent with the RNA-virus nature of SARS-CoV-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>); hence, we focused on cell-free DNA from human sources in this study. We first investigated the global characteristics of plasma cfDNA in COVID-19 patients. Firstly, cfDNA samples from COVID-19 patients show significantly higher GC content (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) than controls, and the GC contents in COVID-19 patients are positively correlated with IgG levels in the peripheral blood (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Secondly, cfDNA samples from COVID-19 patients show significantly altered size patterns compared to controls. We divided the cfDNA data into short (i.e., &#x003C; 150 bp), intermediate (150-250 bp), and long (i.e., &#x003E; 250 bp) categories, as size pattern is a known characteristic that correlates with the tissue origin of cfDNA as well as various physiological conditions of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). As a result, cfDNA samples from COVID-19 patients show significantly higher proportions of short fragments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) while lower proportion of intermediate fragments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>); for the proportions of long fragments, cfDNA from COVID-19 patients do not show significant differences compared to controls; however, mild cases show significantly increased proportion of long molecules than severe patients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The cfDNA size pattern is further validated using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) platform for 10 randomly selected samples (Supplementary Fig. S2). Besides fragment size, end motif pattern is a newly discovered characteristic of plasma cfDNA that correlates with various physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). We analyzed two types of end motifs (termed as 5&#x2019;-CCCA and CT-5&#x2019;-CC; see Methods and Supplementary Fig. S1B) in our data. CfDNA samples from COVID-19 patients show significantly increased levels of 5&#x2019;-CCCA and CT-5&#x2019;-CC end motif usages than controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S1C). In addition, when 5&#x2019;-CCCA and CT-5&#x2019;-CC motif usages are analyzed side-by-side, the COVID-19 blood samples compose two patterns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, one pattern is highlighted in purple circle). In addition, hypertension is the most common comorbidity in the COVID-19 patients; GC contents and motif usages do not show significant differences between COVID-19 patients with hypertension and without hypertension in the same group, while cfDNA size patterns show slight differences between COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension in the same group (Supplementary Fig. S3). Together, the results demonstrate gross abnormalities in cfDNA characteristics of COVID-19 patients.</p>

<title>Alterations and dynamics of cfDNA characteristics during treatment</title>
<p>We compared the plasma cfDNA characteristics at the first timepoint (i.e., upon hospitalization) versus the last timepoint, when treatment had taken effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S4). COVID-19 patients show significant increase in GC levels after treatment for both mild and severe groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). For cfDNA size patterns, differences in proportion of short fragments after treatment are not remarkable in mild patients, while significantly decreased in severe patients; in contrast, both mild and severe groups show significantly elevated proportion of long fragments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). For end motif patterns, elevation in 5&#x2019;-CCCA and CT-5&#x2019;-CC end motif usages is marginal in mild patients while significant in severe patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).

<p>We further investigated whether cfDNA characteristics could reflect the body responses during treatment. To do this, we profiled cfDNA characteristics along with immunoglobulin levels for COVID-19 patients over the time courses during treatment. Three representative cases (1 mild and 2 severe) are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-G</xref>. The SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM level is an important clinical indicator for effective immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Hence, for the patient shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, the immune system starts to take effect from the second timepoint, when SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG level also starts to increase; however, the other 2 cases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref>) do not show convincing SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM signal, suggesting possible immune deficiency or insufficient immunization. CfDNA characteristics also show dynamics during treatment in these samples, such as the proportion of long fragments at certain timepoints. In particular, cfDNA end motif patterns gradually increase in the patient shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> while remain modestly changed in the other two cases.</p>

<title>Tissue injury signals in cell-free DNA</title>
<p>To explore whether plasma cfDNA could reflect organ damages induced by COVID-19, we adapted our previous orientation-aware cfDNA fragmentation analysis approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) to detect signals linked to the tissue origins of cfDNA. Notably, besides blood cells, we focused on lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, pancreas, and brain in this study (Supplementary Tables S1), because these organs are known to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). CfDNA fragmentation patterns for controls are consistent with our previous report that cfDNA coverage decreases in the tissue-specific open chromatin regions if the corresponding tissues contribute DNA in plasma (e.g., blood cells; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), as nucleosome-depletion in such regions makes the DNA unprotected from nuclease digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>); however, we find that cfDNA coverage in the open chromatin regions increase in most COVID-19 samples, which may be due to the elevated GC content in cfDNA of COVID-19 patients, as GC content for tissue-specific open chromatin regions are higher than adjacent regions (Supplementary Fig. S5); nevertheless, altered fragmentation signals (e.g., imbalanced coverage patterns) around tissue-specific open chromatin regions are still observed in certain timepoints in almost all severe COVID-19 patients. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> shows the coverage signal from the same patients as <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref>. For instance, strong fragmentation signals around lung-, pancreas- and brain-specific open chromatin regions are observed at timepoint 2 of the severe case, which echoes the altered cfDNA characteristics (e.g., increase of long fragments) of this patient at the same timepoint (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>).</p>

<p>As an interesting example, we investigated the severe patient who receives convalescent plasma therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) on day 16 of hospitalization. Blood samples are taken 1 day before and &#x223C;6 hours after treatment. Both GC content, size and end motif patterns change remarkably after treatment. Orientation-aware cfDNA fragmentation analysis reveals drastic signal changes after treatment: both coverage and ends around blood cell-, lung-, kidney-, and brain-specific open chromatin regions alter sharply (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Indeed, clinical records of this patient show various positive changes after treatment that are related to these organs, including returning to normal body temperature and improvements in the lung condition (lesions in the lower right lung field are slightly reduced according to chest radiograph and relief of respiratory distress) as well as consciousness state (increased dose of sedative and muscle relaxant).</p>
<p>Moreover, cfDNA fragmentation patterns for lungs, liver, heart, kidney, pancreas, and brain were quantified using our previous OCF (<underline>O</underline>rientation-aware <underline>C</underline>fDNA <underline>F</underline>ragmentation) approach (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). The results for the two presentative patients illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref> are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>. In general, significantly altered OCF values are observed in the majority of patients and/or tissues, suggesting prevalent tissue injuries in COVID-19 patients. Notably, in COVID-19 patients, OCF values are decreased for lungs and brain, while they are elevated for other tissues. We also observe abnormal OCF values in certain timepoints in the COVID-19 patients while the overall statistical comparisons do not show significant differences (mostly due to limited number of timepoints in this patient or other timepoints show similar OCF values to the controls). To overcome this drawback and to provide explicit tissue injury assessment results, we further built a machine learning-based classification model to predict the tissue injuries based on the orientation-aware cfDNA fragmentation signals (see Methods). The results are summarized in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. Notably, clinical diagnoses on tissue injuries for lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart are also available for a proportion of patients. Frequent injuries are observed in various tissues, including lungs, pancreas, and brain, which results are consistent with clinical diagnoses for the majority of patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 has last for more than 1 year. Considering the unclear therapeutics, disease monitoring is of high clinical value for better management and healthcare of the large amount of COVID-19 patients; however, efficient methods are still limited, especially for assessment of various organ injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). In this proof-of-principle study, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of 176 blood samples collected from 37 COVID-19 patients. Although previous studies on cfDNA characteristics exist, most of them focus on elevated cfDNA concentration and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), while our study reveals gross abnormalities and dynamics in a broad range of cfDNA characteristics as well as their clinical potentials in disease monitoring, including increased GC content, altered size and end motif patterns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-D</xref>). COVID-19 patients suffer from active immune response to the viral infection and produces high level of immunoglobulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), which prefer binding/protecting GC-rich DNA (e.g., DNA molecules originated from the open chromatin regions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), suggesting that immune response may be responsible to the abnormalities in plasma cfDNA characteristics in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the NET process is known to generate long cfDNA molecules; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> shows that mild COVID-19 patients tend to have more long cfDNA molecules than controls while severe patients do not. This result suggests that patients in the mild group may have a higher innate immune activity than those in the severe group, which may explain why their symptoms are weaker. In the meantime, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> shows that after treatment, the proportions of long cfDNA molecules are increased in both mild and severe COVID-19 patients, suggesting more NETs, i.e., enhanced immune responses of the patients after treatment, which is consistent with the improvement of clinical symptoms in these patients. It is also interesting to see differences in size patterns between COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension (Supplementary Fig. S3), as previous studies have demonstrated that cfDNA alterations could serve as a diagnostic biomarker for cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). In addition, end motif analysis reveals two patterns in COVID-19 patients; interestingly, most of the samples that form the altered pattern (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, purple circle) are collected at the first or second timepoints of severe patients, when the patients&#x2019; conditions are most critical (e.g., in a coma). Plasma cfDNA fragmentation patterns could be affected by various biological and clinical scenarios, while current knowledge in this field is still limited. Hence, the altered cfDNA signals may suggest aberrant, yet elusive, cell death in COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Furthermore, plasma cfDNA reveal disease dynamics and organ injury signals during the treatment. For instance, significant changes are observed in cfDNA samples at the last timepoint compared to the first timepoint (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref>), indicating that cfDNA characteristics could reflect therapeutic efficacies. Moreover, cfDNA show fragmentation signals around tissue-specific open chromatin regions in various cases, which is partly in line with clinical observations on organ injuries in these patients. In fact, organ injury in COVID-19 patients may correlate and partially explain the altered characteristics in cfDNA, as cells in damaged organs may die abnormally thus release DNA with aberrant fragmentation patterns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). As an interesting example, cfDNA from a severe case receiving plasma therapy show huge alterations &#x223C;6 hours after treatment: we observe drastic changes around blood cell- and lung-specific open chromatin regions, suggesting that the patient has responded to the treatment, especially the lungs, which is evidenced by the clinical observations; kidney-specific open chromatin regions also show strong fragmentation patterns after treatment, which is reasonable because kidney is an important organ for metabolism and is known to involve in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Hence, the data indicate that cfDNA analysis is indeed sensitive in monitoring the body response during treatment.</p>
<p>Detection and monitoring of organ injuries are highly valuable for COVID-19 patients. Tissue injury assessment could be indicative for potential sequelae of the patients as COVID-19 patients frequently suffer from multiple tissue injuries even months after discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), and organ failure is a major cause of mortality in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). In this study, we compared the quantified orientation-aware fragmentation patterns (i.e., OCF values) between COVID-19 patients and controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), which results show frequently altered fragmentation patterns in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that tissue injuries are indeed common in COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, the OCF values for lungs and brain show an opposite direction in COVID-19 patients compared to other tissues. The underline mechanisms are elusive; while for lungs, we think that it may be related to their unique position as the primary organ of viral infection where frequent non-apoptotic cell deaths may occur. Besides the statistical comparisons, we further developed a machine learning-based approach to for qualitative (i.e., yes or no) measurement of tissue injuries, which could provide an explicit result for easier interpretation of the data.</p>
<p>Considering that cfDNA analysis could reveal tumor signals long before clinical diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), we think that cell-free nucleic acid analysis could be more sensitive than clinical diagnosis in tissue injury assessment. For instance, cfDNA analysis shows that almost all COVID-19 patients suffer from lung injury which is consistent with the fact that lungs are the primary infection sites in COVID-19. Besides lungs, kidneys, pancreas, and brain are other organ with frequent injuries, which is consistent with clinical reports on COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Hence, COVID-19 induced low-level oxygen in the blood, blood clots, and cytokine storms can cause kidneys to malfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>); diabetes is one of the most common comorbidities in COVID-19 patients and COVID-19 also causes diabetic symptoms in the non-diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>); neurological abnormalities are also common in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Furthermore, currently convalescent plasma therapy is a legal, yet controversial, therapeutic method for COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Through analyzing the blood sample from one patient with plasma therapy, we show that although plasma therapy makes improvements of clinical symptoms in this patient, it also introduces various tissue injuries therefore suggesting that dedicated medical inspections on various organs would be helpful for patients receiving plasma therapy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we only have limited clinical data for tissue injury assessment in the COVID-19 patients, and clinical diagnoses for pancreas and brain are not available at all. In fact, clinical approaches for organ injury assessment usually require dedicated assays for assessment of each tissue, while such assays may not be feasible, or with a low priority, when the medical system is overloaded during the outbreak of the pandemic; as a contrast, cfDNA is much more favorable as it able to profile the injury landscape of various organs from one tube of peripheral blood, therefore promises a much more efficient and convenient approach. In previous studies, Cheng et al. and Andargie et al. have also investigated tissue injuries in cfDNA through tissue-specific DNA methylation markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>); however, considering the experimental challenges and complexities in current cfDNA methylation profiling assays, our approach significantly lowered the experimental difficulty as we only require routine whole-genome sequencing. In particular, the dynamics of cfDNA characters and tissue injury signal for a mild and a severe patient (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) show favorable consistency (e.g., kidney injury signal in the mild case, and signals of multiple tissue injuries in the severe case), demonstrating the potential of cfDNA in disease monitoring during treatment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are various limitations in this study. Firstly, the clinical diagnosis for many COVID-19 patients and tissues are not available due to the limited medical resources during the outbreak of the pandemic. Secondly, we could only perform qualitative analyses without comprehensive statistical analyses for tissue injuries. Hence, to provide more meritorious information to the clinic, it is worthwhile to validate the results using larger and more thorough datasets in the following studies. In addition, it would be favorable to explore the feasibility of other analyses, such as nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) and promoter coverage patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>) , for quantitative measurement of organ injuries in following works.</p>
<p>As a summary, through analysis of cfDNA in COVID-19 patients, we report alterations and dynamics of cfDNA characteristics during treatment, as well as organ-specific signals in cfDNA, demonstrating that cell-free DNA could serve as valuable analytes for effective disease monitoring and tissue injury assessment of COVID-19 patients.</p>

Considering that most nucleases in mammals function in an endonuclease manner (i.e., they bind to DNA and cut within the bound sequence), besides the 4-mer motifs at the 5&#x2019;-end of cfDNA as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), we extended 2 bp from the 5&#x2019;-end and proposed a novel 4-mer motif definition: 5&#x2019;-CCCA motif usage was calculated as the proportion of reads starting with CCCA, and CT-5&#x2019;-CC motif usage was calculated as the proportion of reads starting with CC and the 2 bp in the genome prior to the 5&#x2019;-end are CT. The definition of 5&#x2019;-CCCA and CT-5&#x2019;-CC motifs are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S1B. As a result, the previous definition presents CCCA while our new definition reveals CTCC as the motif with the highest usage. Notably, in our cohort, the CT-5&#x2019;-CC motif usage is positively correlated with, and always higher than, 5&#x2019;-CCCA, suggesting that our newly discovered CT-5&#x2019;-CC motif could also reflect enzymatic preferences during cell apoptosis.</p>

<title>Orientation-aware cfDNA fragmentation analysis</title>
<p>In our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), we had mined and investigated tissue-specific open chromatin regions for blood cells, lungs, liver, intestines, breast, ovary, and placenta. Based on clinical reports on tissue injuries of COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), we added kidney, pancreas, heart, and brain into the tissue list, while removed placenta from the tissue list (as there is no pregnancy samples in our cohort) in the current study. Tissue-specific open chromatin regions for all the tissues in the list were mined using the same algorithm as described in our previous work. The accession numbers of the Dnase I hypersensitivity data and the final list of tissue-specific open chromatin regions used in this study were summarized in Supplementary Table S1. For each cfDNA sample, coverage and end pattern around the tissue-specific open chromatin regions were profiled using the same algorithm as described in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). To minimize the biases of the abnormally high coverage in the center of open chromatin regions in COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), OCF values for each patient and tissue were quantified using (&#x2212;210, &#x2212;180) and (180, 210) windows around the tissue-specific open chromatin regions.</p>

<title>Prediction of tissue injury using cfDNA fragmentation pattern</title>
<p>Considering that the GC content is significantly elevated in COVID-19 samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), to minimize the potential biases (e.g., from sequencing), we developed a new method to infer tissue injury signals that solely depends on the cfDNA data from the COVID-19 samples. Based on the knowledge that blood cells are the major contributor of cfDNA in most clinical scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>) and to date there is no clinical/genetic evidence of ovary injuries in COVID-19 patients (in fact, a large proportion of the COVID-19 patients are male in our cohort), we utilized the orientation-aware cfDNA fragmentation pattern around blood cell- and ovary-specific open chromatin regions from all COVID-19 blood samples as positive and negative signals, respectively, to train a classification model for injury assessment of other tissues. Briefly, for each cfDNA sample, after profiling of orientation-aware cfDNA end signals around the tissue-specific open chromatin regions, for all the tissues-of-interest (i.e., blood cell, ovary, lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas, heart, and brain), the differences in normalized upstream (<italic>U)</italic> and downstream (<italic>D)</italic> end signals were calculated for each locus in two symmetrical 30 bp windows around the corresponding tissue-specific open chromatin regions (i.e., (&#x2212;210,&#x2212;180) and (180,210)); hence, a vector of 60 values would be obtained for each tissue; then, we collected all the vectors for blood cells and ovary in the COVID-19 blood samples as positive and negative datasets, respectively, to train a classification model using SVM (Support Vector Machine) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). During training, a 5-fold cross-validation was employed, which showed an overall accuracy of 93.5&#x0025; on the training dataset. After model-training, for each of the tissue-of-interest, we applied the SVM classification model on its <italic>U</italic> and <italic>D</italic> end signal difference vector to determine whether it showed injury or not, during which procedure a score (calculated by the classification model) of 0.8 was used as the classification cutoff. Lastly, for each patient, we calculated the frequency of positive injury predictions in his/her blood samples for all the tissues-of-interest as the final prediction results (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4h">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Comparisons of cfDNA characteristics between COVID-19 patients and controls were performed using Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test; comparisons of cfDNA characteristics for COVID-19 patients at the first and last timepoint were conducted using Wilcoxon signed-rank test; comparisons between OCF values for COVID-19 patients and controls were performed using Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. All p-values are two-tailed and a p-value lower than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p>
