<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NiRS) is a relatively new technology of brain imaging with its potential in the assessment of cerebrovascular health only recently discovered. Encouraging early results suggest that NiRS can be used as an inexpensive and portable cerebrovascular health tracking device using a recently proposed pulse relaxation function (PReFx). In this paper, we propose a new NiRS timing index, TI<sub>NiRS</sub>, of cerebrovascular health. TI<sub>NiRS</sub> is a novel use of the NiRS technology. TI<sub>NiRS</sub> is motivated by the previously proved relationship of the timing of the reflected wave with vascular resistance and compliance in the context of pressure waveforms. We correlated both TI<sub>NiRS</sub> and PReFx against age, a non-exercise cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) index, and two existing indices of cerebrovascular health, namely Transcranial Doppler (TCD) augmentation index, AI<sub>TCD</sub>, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) blood flow pulsatility index, PI<sub>MRI</sub>. The TI<sub>NiRS</sub> correlations with Age, CRF, PI<sub>MRI</sub> and AI<sub>TCD</sub> all are significant, i.e., <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.53 (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.002), <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; &#x2212;0.44 (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.011), <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.45 (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.012) and <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.46 (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.010), respectively. PReFx, however, did not have significant correlations with any of the vascular health factors. The proposed timing index is a reliable indicator of cerebrovascular aging factors in the NiRS waveform.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vascular stiffening is an important health indicator and influences health in a manner that is independent of blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The American Heart Association recommends that vascular stiffening be used as a predictor of cardiovascular disease risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Vascular stiffness is inversely proportional to compliance and reflects arterial resistance to stretching and recoiling in response to blood ejection from the heart. In a young or otherwise healthy vascular system, compliant arteries help smooth out the vascular pulsatility induced by blood pressure. As compliance decreases, blood pressure causes structural changes within the arterial walls that adversely affect their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Another change that occurs with reduced vascular compliance is increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. PWV is the speed of the pressure wave traveling from the heart towards the periphery. Simultaneous measurement of arterial pulse in a proximal and a distal arterial sites e.g. common carotid and femoral gives the travel time of the pressure waveform. The distance between the measurement sites can be measured over the body surface. Hence, PWV is calculated as distance divided by travel time between two measurement sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. PWV is commonly measured by applanation tonometry, however, other non-invasive technologies such as MRI and Doppler ultrasound can also be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. A photoplethysmograph (PPG) which uses infrared light emitters and detectors to measure blood volume changes in periphery (e.g. fingertip, ankle, wrist or earlobe), is similarly used to estimate PWV by dividing subject height to the travel time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>When a pressure wave reaches a vascular bifurcation point, a portion of the wave is reflected back towards the heart. The reflected wave eventually augments an incident wave coming from the heart, thereby increasing the pulse pressure. Due to the increased PWV in a stiff arterial system, the reflected wave travels faster, thereby reaching the incident wave earlier in systole and increasing the local pulse pressure even further. Both forward and reflected waves leave a peak or an inflection point on the pressure waveform. The time difference between these peaks is believed to be an estimation of the travel time and used in calculation of PWV and PPG SI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Increased arterial stiffness can damage the arterial endothelium in small arteries and can, over time, produce a pathology known as small vessel disease (SVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The brain, in particular, is highly vulnerable to SVD, as the blood flow to the sub-surface brain structures is compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Based on a comprehensive review, cerebral SVD is believed to be one of the main causes of vascular cognitive impairments and accounts for a quarter of all acute ischaemic strokes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Cerebrovascular compliance is commonly assessed non-invasively using indices derived from blood pressure and flow readings. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the modalities most widely used to acquire cerebrovascular compliance and cerebrovascular health indices. TCD measures blood flow velocity; i.e., the speed at which the blood cells move inside a vessel. While it is possible to estimate compliance using TCD blood flow velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], the method relies on estimates of vascular cross-sectional area, arterial inflow and venous outflow, which are not readily measurable. The TCD indices such as the pulsatility index, PI<sub>TCD</sub>, and augmentation index, AI<sub>TCD</sub>, are the commonly reported TCD cerebrovascular health indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Of these two, PI<sub>TCD</sub> is the most commonly used TCD index due to its ease of calculation. However, AI<sub>TCD</sub> has been shown to have a stronger correlation with cerebrovascular health indicators such as age and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The MRI pulsatility index (PI<sub>MRI</sub>) is the commonly adopted MRI-based cerebrovascular health measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. While MRI has a high spatial resolution for localized measurements, it is less commonly used as it is both costly and time consuming, making it unsuitable for simple and routine monitoring of vascular health in the general population.</p>
<p>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NiRS) is a relatively new technology that measures regional blood volume changes based on absorption of near-infrared light, mainly by oxygenated blood inside cerebral arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. NiRS offers high temporal resolution and is sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in blood volume during the cardiac cycle. Therefore, NiRS allows local studies of cerebrovascular behaviour and possible assessment of cerebrovascular health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. The recently proposed pulse relaxation function (PReFx) is the first NiRS based approach to the indexing of cerebrovascular compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. PReFx measures the deformation of the blood volume waveform during the systolic relaxation phase due to the presence of reflected waves. It has been demonstrated to correlate with CRF and inversely correlate with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. PReFx is an area measurement in the averaged NiRS signal. The PReFx algorithm assumes that the first positive peak after the diastolic minimum is the systolic peak, which may not be the case when the systolic maximum is an inflection point rather than a peak. Therefore, we are motivated to use an index that can be easily applied to NiRS signals. In our previous works we have proposed a new timing index (TI) which which has been shown to significantly correlate with vascular health factors such as age and CRF in a mathematical model of the pressure wave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] and in an experimental study using TCD waveforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. TI is defined as the inverse of the reflection time, i.e. the time difference between the systolic and reflected peaks, and using a tube-based model of the arterial tree, the timing index has been proven to be directly controlled by vascular aging factors including compliance, resistance and PWV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In fact, it has been shown that the reflection time is more than the time it takes for the blood waveform to travel the distance between the measurement site and the reflection site and the waveform faces an additional delay before turning back from the reflection site which is a function of resistive and capacitive properties of the vascular system beyond the reflection site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Therefore, the reflection time is a sum of two time delays, one is a line delay controlled by PWV and physical distance between the measurement and reflection sites and the other is a load delay forced by the vascular properties beyond beyond the reflection site. All these parameters are known to change with ageing and vascular health and thus making TI a powerful vascular stiffness index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. As such, we propose a new NiRS timing index (TI<sub>NiRS</sub>) to directly measure the timing of reflected waves. Here, the NiRS timing index is defined as the inverse of the time between the systolic and reflected waveform peaks in the NiRS signal. Then, we will examine the correlation of the proposed index with other health indices including age, CRF and the most currently used vascular health measures derived from other imaging modalities, namely TCD augmentation index and MRI pulsatility index.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Protocol and Data Collection</title>
<p>Thirty eight adults (23 female, 15 male, age range &#x003D; 24-67 years, mean age &#x003D; 41.7 years) were recruited from the Newcastle, Australia. They provided informed consent prior to assessment. The study protocol was approved by the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee and is registered in the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (AC-TRN12619000144112). All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. TCD recordings from these participants were previously reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Each participant attended the Hunter Medical Research Institute and the University of Newcastle Callaghan campus over two consecutive days and participated in three scanning sessions. Participants were asked to refrain from consuming caffeine before their scans. Height, weight, age, sex and resting heart rate were recorded for each participant and a physical activity questionnaire was completed.</p>
<p>TCD ultrasound (DopplerBox X; Compumedics DWL, Singen, Germany) was used to record resting-state cerebral blood flow velocity from the right and left middle cerebral arteries. Participants were also scanned on a 3T MRI scanner (Magnetom Prisma, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany), equipped with 64-channel receive only head coil, while a standard built-in dual channel body coil was used for RF transmission. Blood flow was quantified using a phase contrast flow quantification sequence (TR &#x003D; 26.5ms, TE &#x003D; 6.9ms, slice thickness &#x003D; 5mm, matrix 256 <italic>&#x00D7;</italic> 256) of a single excitation with a velocity encoding value of 120cm/s on middle cerebral arteries. Finally, participants were instructed to relax and sit still for 300 seconds of resting-state NiRS recording. A frequency-domain NiRS (ISS Imagent, Champaign, Illinois, USA) was used at a 110MHz modulation frequency and sampling rate of 39.0625Hz. The setup montage was designed to cover the majority of the frontal lobe and consisted of four detectors, each crossed with 16 time-multiplexed sources (eight of which operated at 690nm and the other eight at 830nm), making a total of 64 channels. Participants were asked to wear an Equivital EQ02 LifeMonitor sensor belt during this session, which recorded ECG and NiRS signals simultaneously.</p>
<p>During the TCD imaging session, resting-state heart rate was measured using an heart rate monitoring device (Omron HEM-7320). Participants assumed a sitting position for approximately five minutes during headpiece setup before recording commenced. During TCD recording, the heart rate was measured once per minute three times. The mean of these three heart rate measurements was used as the resting-state heart rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Calculating the Indices</title>
<sec id="s2c1">
<title>MRI Pulsatility Index</title>
<p>MRI phase contrast images were processed using the scanner software (Siemens Syngo) by manually placing a region of interest around the middle cerebral artery and quantifying the flow. The MRI pulsatility index, PI<sub>MRI</sub>, was then obtained by subtracting the minimum flow from the maximum flow and dividing it by the mean flow over the cardiac cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]; i.e.,
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21256921v1_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>F</italic> indicates the flow and the bar sign indicates the mean value. Three subjects did not have an MRI scan and among the remaining 35 subjects, PI<sub>MRI</sub> was calculated either for both middle cerebral arteries (<italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 21) or for a single middle cerebral artery (MCA) (<italic>n</italic> &#x003D; 14) based on data quality. The indices from right and left MCAs were then averaged for each subject.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c2">
<title>TCD Augmentation Index</title>
<p>Calculation of the augmentation index, AI<sub>TCD</sub>, requires identification of three characteristic points on an averaged Doppler waveform. Peak systole (<italic>V</italic><sub>sys</sub>), peak diastole (<italic>V</italic><sub>dia</sub>) and the peak of the reflected wave (<italic>V</italic><sub>refl</sub>) are the parameters required to calculate the augmentation index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21256921v1_eqn2.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Thus, the timing of the diastolic peaks was first determined automatically in MATLAB using a peak detector function. Then, each signal was averaged with respect to its diastolic peaks, resulting in an averaged signal covering the duration of a single cardiac cycle. The systolic and reflected peaks were set manually on the averaged signal. The TCD data for two subjects were excluded from the analysis due to noise. The AI<sub>TCD</sub> index was calculated using data from both MCAs (and averaged) for 34 subjects and from a single MCA for two subjects, depending on data quality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c3">
<title>Evaluating Cardiorespiratory Fitness</title>
<p>The CRF was determined using the non-exercise test model proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. It involves a self-reported physical activity score, age, sex, body mass index and resting heart rate. See the <italic>supplementary materials</italic> for the physical activity questionnaire and cardiorespiratory fitness formula.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c4">
<title>NiRS Indices</title>
<p>Optical light intensity NiRS signals were used to derive two different indices: the pulse relaxation function (PReFx) and the proposed timing index, TI<sub>NiRS</sub>. The pre-processing of the recordings was done similarly for both methods and was adopted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] using the &#x201C;<italic>p pod</italic>&#x201D; package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] which is a MATLAB-based software module developed by the same group. Specifically, channels with source detector distances of 20-60 mm were selected and went through a quality-control process passing 1283 channels out of the original 38 <italic>&#x00D7;</italic> 64 &#x003D; 2432 channels. These channels were then normalized by dividing by their mean values and then bandpass-filtered to 0.5-5.0 Hz to capture the dynamics of the pulse signal and remove any low-frequency elements and moving artefacts. The resulting signal was averaged with respect to the ECG R peaks, and then rotated around the x-axis (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The result is called the arterial pulsation signal, <italic>s</italic>. The rotation was performed so that the systolic peak would appear as a positive peak and the shape of the signal would look similar to that of a blood pressure, flow or volume signal. This facilitates understanding of the waveform. The arterial pulsation signals were visually inspected and channels that did not have a pulse shape were removed (i.e., low blood volume at the beginning and end representing diastole, and an increase in between representing systole). Some 964 channels passed the pre-processing stage for further analysis. Channels with source detector distances between 25 and 50 mm proved to be most likely to generate usable waveforms.</p>

<title>PReFx</title>
<p>The pulse relaxation function is calculated based on the methods explained in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. In brief, <italic>s</italic><sub>D1</sub> and <italic>s</italic><sub>D2</sub> peaks occur as minima in the <italic>s</italic> signal in the first and the second cardiac cycles and <italic>s</italic><sub>S</sub> occurs as the first local maximum after <italic>s</italic><sub>D1</sub> (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). {<italic>s</italic><sub>D1</sub>, <italic>s</italic><sub>D2</sub>} and <italic>s</italic><sub>S</sub> are intended to represent the diastolic and systolic peaks, respectively. However, <italic>s</italic><sub>S</sub> is not necessarily a systolic peak, see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2b</xref> where <italic>s</italic><sub>S</sub> is the reflected peak and the systolic peak indicated by an arrow.

Note that if the drop in volume between peaks was linear, PReFx would equal zero. After communicating with the authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], channels with PReFx value outside the interval of [&#x2212;0.1, 0.4] were removed and other channels were manually excluded from the calculations where reflected peaks were selected by the algorithm (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> for an example). A total of 245 additional channels were removed in this process. Finally, for each subject with more than ten PReFx values, an averaged PReFx value was calculated as the index of vascular compliance. We were able to calculate PReFx for 29 of the 38 subjects.</p>

<sec id="s2c6">
<title>TI<sub>NiRS</sub></title>
<p>We define the timing index as the inverse of the time between the forward and reflected waveform peaks. In order to find the timing of these peaks, named <italic>t</italic><sub>sys</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>refl</sub> for peak systole and peak reflection, respectively, for a given signal, <italic>s</italic>, a completely automated algorithm is proposed (Sample data and codes available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Rashid-Afkhami">https://github.com/Rashid-Afkhami</ext-link>). The algorithm uses the second derivative to locate key points in the signal, this is based on similar approaches that have been proposed for locating inflection point in the pressure waveform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Firstly, the second derivative, <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub>, of <italic>s</italic> is calculated. Next, the following time points are defined on the <italic>s</italic> and the <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub> signals: {<italic>t</italic><sub>p1</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>p2</sub>, &#x2026;,} the time of the peaks on the <italic>s</italic> signal and {<italic>t</italic><sub>zc1</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>zc2</sub>, &#x2026;} the time of zero-crossings on the <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub> signal. If the number of <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub> zero-crossings is less than 4, the channel is excluded. Otherwise,
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21256921v1_eqn4.gif"/></alternatives>

Then, to define <italic>t</italic><sub>refl</sub> the algorithm checks only the time period between <italic>t</italic><sub>zc3</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>zc4</sub>. If <italic>s</italic> has a positive peak, <italic>t</italic><sub>refl</sub> is set as the time point corresponding to this peak, <italic>t</italic><sub>pi</sub>, otherwise, it is set as the time when <italic>s</italic><sub>2</sub> reaches its minimum, <italic>t</italic><sub>min</sub> (all in the specified time period between <italic>t</italic><sub>zc3</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>zc4</sub>) i.e.,

After all channels are processed for a subject, channels with <italic>t</italic><sub>sys</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>refl</sub> outside their mean <italic>&#x00B1;</italic>1.5 std (i.e., standard deviation) or outside a predefined threshold were also excluded from further calculations. The predefined threshold for <italic>t</italic><sub>sys</sub> was any value &#x003C;125 ms and for <italic>t</italic><sub>refl</sub> it was any value &#x003E;500 ms. Then, if ten or more channels remained, the <italic>t</italic><sub>sys</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>refl</sub> values for each channel were used to calculate the timing index as:

</disp-formula>
The timing index values of different channels were then averaged for each participant. Of the original 38 subjects, we were able to calculate a TI for 32 of them. Examples of the proposed algorithm are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> when the algorithm is applied to in vivo and simulated signals. Three main types of the arterial pulsation signals, <italic>s</italic>, are shown in this figure where the detected <italic>t</italic><sub>sys</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>refl</sub> correspond to either a peak point or an inflection point on the recorded signal. The simulated signals are formed by adding three waveforms, an incident forward-traveling waveform, a reflected waveform and a re-reflected waveform (which is also traveling towards the periphery). The purpose of the simulated waveforms is to better visualize where the underlying waveforms reach their peak and how the algorithm performs in terms of detecting the peak times. For each simulated case the underlying waveforms are arranged in a form that the resulted observed signal (black line) resembles an in vivo case. Using a NiRS device only the composite signal <italic>s</italic> is detected and the wave components shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">f</xref> are for illustrative purposes only.</p>

<p>Statistical analysis was carried out in MATLAB using the inbuilt <italic>corr</italic> function.

<title>Results</title>
<p>The correlations of the proposed NiRS timing index and existing NiRS PReFx index with the indices derived from other imaging modalities, age and CRF are reported in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Corresponding scatter-plots are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. Least-squares linear models have not been provided for <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4.G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4.H</xref> due to small slopes. Significant correlations after correcting for multiple comparisons are marked with an asterisk. Note that PReFx is an index of vascular compliance whereas TI<sub>NiRS</sub> is an index of vascular stiffness that is inversely proportional to compliance. Therefore, the two indices show opposite signs when correlated with the same factors. The proposed systolic peak and reflected wave peak detection algorithm for TI<sub>NiRS</sub> detected 228 channels (out of 964 input channels) with a systolic peak corresponding to an inflection point (mean participant age for these channels &#x003D; 42.5 years). Both TI<sub>NiRS</sub> (the peak detection algorithm) and PReFx indices are affected by the sampling frequency of 39.0625Hz (i.e. <italic>&#x2248;</italic> 25ms sampling interval) used in this study; a faster sampling rate would allow a higher resolution and more accurate results.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The NiRS indices are designed to measure vascular stiffness, which is well correlated with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] and cardiorespiratory fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Thus, a common approach with any vascular index is to compare its relationship with age and CRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and here we have done the same. The PReFx correlation coefficient reported here for age is consistent with existing studies; however, the correlation with CRF is lower than previously reported. PReFx correlations with age and CRF in the adult population have so far been studied by the same research group using two different datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Reported correlations with age are <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; &#x2212;0.39 (mean age &#x003D; 69.87 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; &#x2212;0.43 (mean age &#x003D; 47.8 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]; a correlation of <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; &#x2212;0.60, mean age &#x003D; 58.8 years was reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] for a combination of the two datasets. Our reported correlation, <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; <italic>&#x2014;</italic>0.40 (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.030), although consistent with the previous values, is not significant. Reported correlations with CRF are <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.416 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], however, our correlation with CRF of <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.24 (<italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.203) was not significant. Given that the mean age for our sample is 41.7 years, we suspect that the PReFx measure has a lower correlation in younger subjects than older ones. Based on the performance of the PReFx algorithm on the current data, we have identified two potential sources that can distort the PReFx calculation and potentially cause lower correlations. Firstly, there are cases where the PReFx algorithm detects reflected peaks instead of systolic peaks as the <italic>s</italic><sub>S</sub> points. The PReFx algorithm assumes the first local maximum after the minimum peak, i.e. <italic>s</italic><sub>S</sub>, to be the systolic peak, which is not accurate when the true systolic peak is in the form of an inflection point (e.g., see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and 3b). Based on our analysis these cases account for almost one-fourth of all channels (228 of the 964 studied channels) and are more likely to occur in older participants in which the reflected wave moves faster and reaches the incident wave sooner than in younger participants. The second problem occurs in channels with a notch in the signal after the systolic and reflected peaks, which is likely caused by closure of the aortic valve (similar to the dicrotic notch seen in the pressure waveform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]). This notch can appear as a large deformation in the signal (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> for an example), which will change PReFx values independently of vascular health factors. Among the aforementioned two potential causes of low correlation for PReFx, the first was eliminated in the results reported in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> by discarding channels where <italic>s</italic><sub>S</sub> was assigned to the reflected peak. However, if all the channels are included in the calculations, it will remove the significant correlation of PReFx with age; i.e., <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; &#x2212;0.19.</p>
<p>While no previous NiRS studies have reported a timing index, the correlations of TI<sub>NiRS</sub> with age and CRF match those of the TCD reported by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. That is, correlations of <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.70 and <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.50 between TCD TI and age in two different datasets and a correlation of <italic>r</italic> &#x003D; &#x2212;0.79 between TCD TI and CRF. The proposed NiRS timing index, TI<sub>NiRS</sub>, also shows significant correlations with age (<italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.53, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.002) and CRF (<italic>r</italic> &#x003D; &#x2212;0.44, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.011). TI<sub>NiRS</sub> correlated more strongly with both age and CRF than PReFX. This suggests that TI may be a more sensitive index than PReFX to age and lifestyle related cerebrovascular changes in middle-aged participants.</p>
<p>Based on a previously proven association between PI<sub>MRI</sub> and SVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], we expect NiRS indices to correlate with the MRI pulsatility index which is an indicator of vascular health. PReFx showed no significant correlation with PI<sub>MRI</sub> (<italic>r</italic> &#x003D; &#x2212;0.01, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.978), whereas TI<sub>NiRS</sub> correlated significantly with PI<sub>MRI</sub> (<italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.45, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.012). PI<sub>MRI</sub> indicates vascular health by measuring the pulsatility of the blood flow. High pulsatility means that fast traveling reflected waves join incident waves and contribute to increased maximum flow peaks. Similarly, TI<sub>NiRS</sub> reaches greater values when the reflected wave peak is closer to the systolic peak and pulsatility is high. PReFx also changes based on the location of the reflected wave; high PReFx values correspond to channels with high deformation from a perfect sinusoidal waveform, i.e., the existence of a reflected peak. However, the presence of a dicrotic notch may also affect the PReFx index by distorting the wave shape while having no effect on PI or TI. Thus, in channels with a prominent dicrotic notch the PReFx may be high while pulsatility is low, which may explain the lower correlation for PReFx.</p>
<p>TI<sub>NiRS</sub> showed a significant correlation with the TCD augmentation index (<italic>r</italic> &#x003D; 0.46, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.010), while the correlation of PReFx with AI<sub>TCD</sub> was not significant (<italic>r</italic> &#x003D; &#x2212;0.26, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.173). The augmentation index is a widely accepted index used in both blood pressure and flow velocity (TCD) signals, and is a strong predictor of vascular aging and stiffening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The AI captures the augmentation of the incident wave by the reflected wave, with smaller values reflecting no augmentation when the arteries are healthy and the propagation speed is low. TI indexes this delay between the incident and reflected waves directly, which is why AI<sub>TCD</sub> and TI<sub>NiRS</sub> are significantly correlated. The PReFx also correlates with AI as larger PReFx values can correspond to late reflected waves leaving a peak on the systolic-to-diastolic segment of the arterial pulsation signal and thus increasing the area under the curve. Nevertheless, the correlation may be weakened when the presence of dicrotic notch increases PReFx regardless of the reflected wave.</p>
<p>Overall, NiRS blood volume waveforms are believed to closely resemble the changes in blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] which is also supported by the use of infrared light in PPG and its morphological similarity to the arterial blood pressure waveform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Thus, we believe that the proposed NiRS timing index is affected similarly by vascular health parameters in the same way as the timing index derived from the blood pressure waveforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. As blood pressure can not be readily measured in cerebral vessels, a NiRS-based timing index can provide an alternative approach.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this paper, we presented a novel NiRS based cerebrovascular stiffness index, TI<sub>NiRS</sub>. The TI<sub>NiRS</sub> correlates significantly with age, CRF and other cerebrovascular health indices derived from TCD and MRI data, indicating it has high performance in tracking changes in the cerebrovascular system. NiRS offers a potentially valuable means of indexing vascular health and has superior cost, portability and widespread implementation potential compared with existing techniques.</p>
