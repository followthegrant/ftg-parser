<title>Abstract</title>
<p>For the first time, we report the influence of vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on genome-wide gene expression in whole blood from healthy women representing two ethnic groups, white European and South Asian. In this randomised placebo-controlled trial, participants were given daily physiological doses (15 &#x03BC;g) of either vitamin D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> for 12 weeks and changes in the transcriptome were compared relative to the transcriptome at baseline. While there was some overlap in the repertoire of differentially expressed genes after supplementation with each vitamin D source, most changes were specific to either vitamin D<sub>3</sub> or vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that each form of the vitamin may have different effects on human physiology. Notably, following vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation, the majority of changes in gene expression reflected a down-regulation in the activity of genes, many encoding components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. These are consistent with the emerging concept that vitamin D orchestrates a shift in the immune system towards a more tolerogenic status. The profound differences in gene expression after supplementation with vitamin D<sub>2</sub> compared with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> warrant a more intensive investigation of the biological effects of the two forms of vitamin D on human physiology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vitamin D is a pro-hormone that is critical for good health. While vitamin D&#x2019;s function in maintaining the musculo-skeletal system is best understood, it fulfils myriad roles in human physiology, including maintaining a healthy immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Prietl et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Martens et al., 2020</xref>). Vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) below 25 nmol/L) or inadequacy (defined as serum level of 25(OH)D below 50 nmol/L) is considered a global pandemic and a public health issue of great importance in the human population, especially in older people, individuals not exposed to sufficient sunlight and, importantly, ethnic minority groups with dark skin tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kohlmeier, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lanham-New et al., 2020</xref>). Vitamin D deficiency is considered to have many detrimental effects on human health which include increased risk of osteoporotic and stress fractures, increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and some cancers, and poor modulation of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Holick, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bouillon, 2018</xref>). Low vitamin D status is associated with higher mortality, including death from cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) is produced in the skin by the action of ultraviolet B radiation from the sun. Following two successive hydroxylation steps, in the liver and kidney, respectively, the active form of the vitamin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>) binds to the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) and, in complex with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), the heterodimer regulates expression of hundreds of genes through the vitamin D response element (VDRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Long et al., 2015</xref>). Vitamin D can also be obtained from foods or as a supplement. Both the plant/fungus-derived vitamin D<sub>2</sub> (ergocalciferol) and the animal-derived D<sub>3</sub> forms are available as nutritional supplements. Both can be hydroxylated into their active forms and bind to the VDR with similar affinity, but there are differences in their catabolism and in their binding affinity to vitamin D binding protein (DBP), the major vitamin D transport protein in blood. Vitamin D<sub>2</sub> binds DBP with lower affinity and is catabolised faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hollis, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Houghton and Vieth, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The functional equivalence, or otherwise, of vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> for human health has been a subject of much debate in recent years, with some authors suggesting that the two compounds have equal efficacy while others provide evidence that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> increases circulating serum 25(OH)D concentration more efficiently than vitamin D<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tripkovic et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>). Current guidance given to the general public by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the UK Department of Health and Social Care, and other government bodies around the world lack acknowledgement that the two forms of vitamin D are not considered equivalent or equally effective when used at nutritional (physiological) doses, while at high doses vitamin D<sub>2</sub> is less potent. The NIH state that most evidence indicates that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> increases serum 25(OH)D levels to a greater extent and maintains these higher levels longer than vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, even though both forms are well absorbed in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">ODS, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Although vitamin D is best known for its role in maintaining bone health and calcium homeostasis, it also exerts a broad range of extra-skeletal effects on cellular physiology and on the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Pilz et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schwalfenberg, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Christakos et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Rosen et al., 2012</xref>) and multiple studies have linked poor vitamin D status with the pathogenesis of immune mediated inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Damoiseaux and Smolders, 2018</xref>). Vitamin D is essential for human health and it is recommended that individuals maintain serum concentrations of at least 25 nmol/L of 25(OH)D (the accepted biomarker of systemic vitamin D status), throughout the year and throughout the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">SACN, 2016</xref>). However, it can be difficult to sustain such levels of serum 25(OH)D year-round from diet and sunlight alone, particularly amongst &#x2018;at-risk&#x2019; groups, such as those with limited sun exposure or those with darker skin tone living in northern latitudes (above 40&#x00B0;N).</p>
<p>In acute studies comparing the efficacy of vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> in raising serum 25(OH)D concentration, vitamin D<sub>2</sub> is less effective than D<sub>3</sub> when given as single bolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tripkovic et al., 2012</xref>). However, the findings from studies following the daily administration of D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> over longer time-periods are more equivocal, with clinical trials showing higher efficacy of D<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zittermann et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tripkovic et al., 2017</xref>) or equal efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Holick et al., 2008</xref>). In a recent meta-analysis, supplementation with vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> were found equally effective in raising 25(OH)D concentrations in infants up to 1 year of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zittermann et al., 2020</xref>). It should be noted that supplementation with one form of vitamin D can reduce circulating concentrations of the other form. For example, our recent comparative trial of D<sub>2</sub> versus D<sub>3</sub> revealed that serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentration was reduced over the 12-week intervention in participants given vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, compared with the average 12-week concentration in participants given placebo ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tripkovic et al., 2017</xref>), see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, for example). The implications of such reciprocal depletion remain to be explored.</p>

<p>There is limited understanding of the effects of vitamin D supplementation on gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> in humans because of the diversity of experimental designs used. This includes: (i) diverse sampling intervals, ranging from hours to years following vitamin D supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berlanga-Taylor et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Neme et al., 2019</xref>); (ii) use of substantially different doses ranging from physiological (moderate) to supra-physiological doses; and (iii) relatively small numbers of participants were recruited so that most studies were considerably underpowered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Neme et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hossein-nezhad et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, there is no robust evidence, from <italic>in vivo</italic> human genome-wide expression analysis, about which specific cellular pathways are influenced by vitamin D supplementation. Moreover, the influence of vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, as distinct from vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, on gene expression in humans has not yet been evaluated, even though vitamin D<sub>2</sub> is used widely as a supplement and food fortificant.</p>
<p>We have addressed this gap in knowledge by investigating gene expression in a relatively large cohort of healthy white European and South Asian women who participated in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial that compared the relative efficacy of vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> in raising serum 25(OH)D concentration. The study concluded that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> was superior to vitamin D<sub>2</sub> in raising serum 25(OH)D concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tripkovic et al., 2017</xref>). As an integral part of the original study design, we also investigated gene expression in the participants over the 12-week trial period. This allowed us to examine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the transcriptome and to determine whether these effects might differ depending on supplementation with vitamin D<sub>2</sub> compared with vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. We therefore sampled blood at the beginning, middle and end of the 12-week intervention and quantified changes in the whole blood transcriptome. Surprisingly, we observed that the two vitamins exerted overlapping but different effects on the human blood transcriptome. Our findings support the hypothesis that the biological effects of vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> may differ in humans and suggest that a more comprehensive analysis of the biological effects of the two forms of vitamin D on human physiology is warranted. In this context, it is important to note that a recent meta-analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials found that reduced cancer mortality was seen only with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation, not with vitamin D<sub>2</sub> supplementation, and indicated that all-cause mortality was significantly lower in trials with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation than in trials with vitamin D<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The study volunteers were South Asian (SA) and white European (WE) women based in the United Kingdom, aged between 20 and 64 years (n=335; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tripkovic et al., 2017</xref>)) and participation was for 12 weeks over the winter months (October to March, in Surrey, UK; latitude, 51&#x00B0;14&#x2019; N). Serum measurements, including concentrations of total 25(OH)D, 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> and 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, were determined from fasting blood samples taken at the start (baseline defined as Visit 1 (V1)) and at weeks 6 (V2) and 12 (V3). To determine whether changes in serum 25(OH)D concentration as a result of vitamin D supplementation are associated with physiological changes at the level of gene expression, we investigated the whole blood transcriptome from a representative subset of the study participants (n=98) using total RNA isolated from V1 and V3 blood samples and Agilent Human Whole Genome 8&#x00D7; 60K v2 DNA microarrays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Participants for transcriptome analysis were selected to provide comparable numbers between the placebo and the two vitamin D treatment groups, covering the full range of serum responses to supplementation within the D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> treatment groups, as judged from the measured changes in serum 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> or 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentration between V1 and V3 (<bold>Supplementary Data File 1</bold>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Metadata for the transcriptome analysis cohort</title>
<p>Following microarray data quality control, transcriptome data were available for both the V1 and V3 samples of 97 study participants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>); the RNA from one participant failed quality control and was excluded. Similar to data reported previously for the entire study cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tripkovic et al., 2017</xref>), the sub-set of participants in the present study showed increased concentrations of 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> and 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> only after supplementation with vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, respectively, and higher total 25(OH)D in both treatment groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> treatment groups the mean 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> serum levels rose by 59&#x0025; (WE) and 116&#x0025; (SA) over the 12-week intervention. Conversely, mean serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentrations fell across the 12 weeks of the study in the placebo groups who did not receive additional vitamin D; 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> baseline vitamin D levels in the SA ethnic group tended to be lower than for the WE group and dropped, respectively, by 23&#x0025; and 29&#x0025; relative to baseline V1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>; <bold>Supplementary Data File 1</bold>). It is notable that, in the vitamin D<sub>2</sub> treatment group, serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentration decreased to a greater extent over the 12-week period, by 52&#x0025; (SA) and 53&#x0025; (WE); the implications of this are considered further in the Discussion. Serum 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> was low in the absence of specific supplementation, typically less than 5 nmol/L (152/162 samples analysed). Serum calcium concentration, appropriately adjusted for serum albumin concentration, was maintained within a normal clinical range across all sample groups, while the concentration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) was stable between V1 and V3 only within the SA placebo group, the WE vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and WE vitamin D<sub>3</sub> intervention groups. PTH concentrations showed an increase at V3 compared with V1 in the WE placebo group, but a decrease in both the vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> intervention groups in the SA ethnic cohort.</p>

<p>Filtering of the normalised microarray data to select for probes showing signals at least 10&#x0025; above background in at least 41 (&#x223C;20&#x0025;) of the arrays yielded transcript abundance data from 20,662 probes corresponding to 17,588 different genomic features (12,436 of which were annotated with an ENTREZ gene identifier). Using the filtered data, we identified significant differences in the transcriptional responses occurring across the 12-week V1 to V3 period of the study <italic>between</italic> the vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and placebo treatment groups for each ethnic cohort and, in a separate analysis, to determine significant changes <italic>within</italic> each group between the V3 and V1 sampling points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; <bold>Supplementary Data File 2</bold>). The former was tested in a &#x2018;difference-in-difference&#x2019; analysis according to the generalised null hypothesis [treatment1.V3 &#x2013; treatment1.V1] - [treatment2.V3 &#x2013; treatment2.V1] = 0 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, rows 7-12), and the latter using treatment.V3 &#x2013; treatment.V1 = 0 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, rows 1-6).</p>

<p>No significant changes in probe signals (adj.P.Val&#x003C;=0.05) were identified in the &#x2018;difference-in-difference&#x2019; analysis for the data for the WE ethnic group, but five were found in the corresponding analysis of the SA cohort (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Furthermore, difference-in-difference analysis of the entire study data, ignoring ethnicity, did not yield statistically significant changes between the D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> treatment groups and the placebo control (data not shown). We note that another &#x2018;difference-in-difference&#x2019; study on the influence of vitamin D on gene expression (the BEST-D trial) failed to identify any significant changes in gene expression following long-term vitamin D treatment in a Caucasian cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berlanga-Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). The observed log<sub>2</sub> fold-change (log<sub>2</sub>FC) in signal abundances between V3 and V1 in the study typically fall well within &#x002B;/- 1, and in such a context it is likely that the sample sizes used within the study restrict our ability to reliably identify individual gene expression responses using this highly conservative approach. We consider that inter-individual differences in human populations are likely to hinder detection of small statistically significant gene expression changes <italic>across</italic> treatment groups from microarray-derived data; however, statistically significant differences are detected when evaluating gene expression changes <italic>within</italic> an individual across time (as described below where we examine paired observations with two time points per subject). The five significant changes that were identified as occurring in response to treatment of the SA ethnic group with vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, relative to the placebo, are summarised in <bold>Supplementary Fig. 1</bold>. These are driven primarily by the marked changes in the placebo group between the V1 and V3 sampling points, and may be associated with the sustained low serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, or high PTH, concentrations observed in this group of subjects. One of these differentially expressed genes encodes the cAMP response element binding protein CREB1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) which is part of the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway in bone cells which contributes to the regulation of skeletal metabolism in response to PTH concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the difference-in-difference analysis, the direct <italic>within</italic>-group comparisons of transcript abundance measurements at V3 versus V1 per subject identified large numbers of significant changes in gene expression, most notably in the WE D<sub>2</sub>, WE D<sub>3</sub> and WE placebo groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">c</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Data File 2</bold>). These significant gene expression changes in the WE ethnic cohort arising in the vitamin D treatment groups are considered in more detail below. While there is some overlap in the groups of differentially expressed genes, only 13&#x0025; of down-regulated differentially expressed genes (102 of 774) were common between the two vitamin D treatment groups, while 28&#x0025; (216 of 774) and 59&#x0025; (456 of 774) were uniquely down-regulated by D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub>, respectively (excluding those additionally down-regulated in the placebo group over the equivalent 12-week intervention)(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>). As previously noted above, the serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentration fell over the 12-week intervention period in the vitamin D<sub>2</sub>-treated group; thus, changes in gene expression observed in this group could <italic>a priori</italic> either be due to the influence of vitamin D<sub>2</sub> itself, or could be attributable to the depletion of the endogenous 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> reserves. It was therefore important to have included comparative transcriptomic analysis of the placebo group in this study to distinguish gene expression changes resulting from vitamin D<sub>2</sub> <italic>per se</italic> from those changes arising due to the depletion of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels in this vitamin D<sub>2</sub> treatment group.</p>
<p>It is notable that expression of a large number of genes was altered between the first and last visits (V1 to V3) in the non-treated placebo group. While some of these changes will be attributable to the effects of the vitamin D depletion observed in this group over the course of the study, there is significant over-representation of genes known to exhibit seasonal differences in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dopico et al., 2015</xref>) (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2</bold>). There is however no unique association of seasonally expressed genes with the data for the WE placebo group; a similar significant enrichment is also observed for the significant changes in gene expression identified in the WE D<sub>2</sub> and WE D<sub>3</sub> treatment groups (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2</bold>) and therefore it is unlikely that this apparent seasonal effect exclusively reflects vitamin D-specific effects. There was no overlap between genes significantly down-regulated exclusively in the placebo group and those significantly up-regulated exclusively in the vitamin D treatment groups (or vice versa). Consistent with the 12-week period of the study, seasonal changes in gene expression are therefore a background feature of all the data collected, and is therefore a factor that needs to be considered when undertaking such time course studies.</p>
<p>In the group of probe signals with significantly reduced abundance in the V3 samples compared with V1 in the data for the vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> supplemented participants, but not in the placebo participants, Probe A_33_P3275751, detecting <italic>SEC14L1</italic> gene transcription showed the largest decrease in response to both forms of vitamin D (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). This probe was originally designed to detect &#x2018;transcript variant 7&#x2019; and hybridizes to a location at the 3&#x2019; end of the <italic>SEC14L1</italic> locus, detecting several splice variants. High expression of <italic>SEC14L1</italic> is significantly associated with lymphovascular invasion in breast cancer patients, where transcript abundance correlates positively with higher grade lymph node metastasis, and poor prognostic outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sonbul et al., 2018</xref>). Its overexpression is also frequent in prostate cancer where <italic>SEC14L1</italic> has been identified as a potential biomarker of aggressive progression of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agell et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burdelski et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Genes significantly down-regulated by both D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub>, but not placebo, are enriched for functions associated with immune responses</title>
<p>Given the relatively small sample sizes used in this study it is considered more appropriate to examine enrichment of cellular pathways among differentially expressed genes rather than focusing on changes in individual genes. Functional enrichment analysis of the genes represented by the probes specifically repressed by vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> (blue data points in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) suggests that both supplements have suppressive effects on the immune response in the WE ethnic group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <bold>Supplementary Data File 3</bold>). Indeed, a significant (p = 1.98E-06) protein-protein interaction network derived from the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> medium confidence interactions curated in the STRING database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Szklarczyk et al., 2017b</xref>) is centred on a highly connected group of proteins associated with the innate immune response, neutrophil degranulation and leukocyte activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>; all protein groups are detailed in <bold>Supplementary Data File 3</bold>). This includes the histone acetyltransferase, EP300, known to function as a transcriptional coactivator with VDR, the vitamin D receptor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fetahu et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, these findings are consistent with the emerging view that vitamin D exposure leads to a shift from a pro-inflammatory to a more tolerogenic immune status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Prietl et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Martens et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparative functional enrichment analysis supports roles for vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> in the suppression of immunity, and in chromatin modification and spliceosome function</title>
<p>As a complementary approach to the functional enrichment analysis of specific subsets of genes whose expression is altered by supplementation with vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> but not by placebo treatment, a comparative functional enrichment analysis of all significant changes in each treatment group was performed (see Methods). This aimed to identify functional categories that are more extensively affected by vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, or by vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, or by both vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub>, than by the placebo, and took into consideration the changes occurring in the placebo treatment group across the 12 weeks of the study (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; <bold>Supplementary Data File 4</bold>). Consistent with the earlier analysis, functional categories associated with immunity and immune response pathways are prominent among those genes repressed by vitamin D supplementation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), while mitochondrial, ribosomal and spliceosomal functions are prominent in the induced genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Although the two vitamin treatments share many common categories identified from this analysis, the results also highlight some differences between the respective effects of D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> supplementation. For example, &#x2018;histone exchange&#x2019; is significant only in the vitamin D<sub>2</sub> up-regulated genes, and &#x2018;chromatin modifying enzymes&#x2019; are significant only in the D<sub>3</sub> down-regulated genes.</p>

<title>Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identifies modules of co-expressed genes that significantly correlate with serum markers of vitamin D supplementation in the WE and SA ethnic groups</title>
<p>WGCNA quantifies both the correlations between individual pairs of genes or probes across a data set, and also the extent to which these probes share the same neighbours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>). The WGCNA process creates a dendrogram that clusters similarly abundant probes into discrete branches, and subsequent cutting of the dendrogram yields separate co-expression modules, representing putatively co-regulated sets of genes. The first principal component of the expression matrix of each module defines the expression profile of the eigengene for the module, and this can then be correlated with experimental metadata. By allowing phenotypic traits to be associated with relatively small numbers (tens) of module eigengenes, instead of thousands of individual variables (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. gene probes), WGCNA both alleviates the multiple testing problem associated with standard differential expression analysis and also directly relates experimental traits to gene expression data in an unsupervised way that is agnostic of the experimental design.</p>
<p>WGCNA was used to construct separate signed co-expression networks for the WE and SA ethnic groups as described in the Methods, and Pearson correlations between expression of the module eigengenes and serum 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub>, 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, total 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations were calculated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and <bold>Supplementary data files 6 - 8</bold>). These results therefore ignore whether the data originates from the vitamins D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> or placebo treatment groups and focus solely on the relationship between the serum metabolite concentrations and gene expression. A significant negative correlation was observed between 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> concentration and expression modules in the WE co-expression network that are enriched for immune-associated functions (midnight blue and pink modules in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). This is consistent with the results from the different analytical approaches (presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Similarly, the only module exhibiting a significant positive correlation with 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> (and total 25(OH)D concentration), the red expression module, is enriched for GO categories associated with the ribosome and mRNA processing (<bold>Supplementary Data File 6</bold>). No significant correlations with serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentrations were detected in the WE cohort.</p>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, stronger and more numerous correlations were observed in the co-expression network for the SA cohort (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). In agreement with the WE network, an expression module significantly associated with the ribosome (black module in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>) showed a general positive correlation with total 25(OH)D concentration whereas a module enriched for histone binding (turquoise) had a significant negative correlation with 25(OH)D concentration. Strikingly however, modules enriched for immune response functions (midnightblue, orange, purple, yellow in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>) were consistently positively correlated with total 25(OH)D and usually 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, but not 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the SA network, and negatively correlated with PTH concentrations. This raises the possibility that vitamin D supplementation may exert different effects on the immune system depending on ethnicity of the individual, may indicate that PTH status has an influence on the outcome and may reflect physiological differences resulting from the low baseline vitamin D status in SA women. In this context we observed that PTH concentrations at the V1 sampling point in the SA cohort were elevated compared with those in the WE cohort (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Vitamin D intake down-regulates expression of many genes including those encoding multiple pathways involved in innate and adaptive immunity</title>
<p>In the present study we shed light on the physiological effects of the two forms of vitamin D commonly used as food-fortificants or vitamin supplements. Using data from the same intervention study, previously we reported that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation is more effective than supplementation with vitamin D<sub>2</sub> in raising serum 25(OH)D concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tripkovic et al., 2017</xref>). However, other studies have reported that the two forms of vitamin D are equally effective in raising serum 25(OH)D concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Holick et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zittermann et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study we examined gene expression changes <italic>in vivo</italic> following supplementation with either vitamin D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> (or placebo) in healthy women from the South East of the UK. Here we extend the results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tripkovic et al. (2017)</xref> by conducting whole genome transcriptome analysis in 97 of the original cohort of 335 women from two ethnic backgrounds, South Asian (SA) and white European (WE). We characterised gene expression changes in the human blood transcriptome in response to vitamin D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> supplementation over a 12-week treatment intervention over the winter months; the randomised groups were provided with physiological (15 &#x03BC;g) daily doses of vitamin D<sub>2</sub> or vitamin D<sub>3</sub> fortified foods, or identical foods without added vitamin D (placebo). We found extensive changes in gene expression in all three treatment groups, some of which were unique to the vitamin D<sub>2</sub>-treated or D<sub>3</sub>-treated groups, with the majority exhibiting downregulation of transcription over the 12-week intervention period. Our success in detecting statistically significant differential gene expression in this study stems partly from the longitudinal design where it was possible to evaluate statistical differences in transcript levels within each group (from baseline to 12-week measurement). This approach partly circumvents the problems with inter-individual differences in human studies which make it difficult to detect robust changes between different groups of individuals. Furthermore, the statistical analysis approach examined pairwise differences in gene expression from the V1 and V3 samples, which helps to reduce the impact of inter-individual differences on statistical significance.</p>
<p>This <italic>in vivo</italic> human transcriptome study has demonstrated long-term effects on gene expression. The majority of differentially expressed genes identified in this study were suppressed by vitamin D supplementation, and many of these encoded pathways were involved in immunity. Many of these observed gene expression changes are consistent with vitamin D exerting a modulating effect on the immune system, leading towards a more tolerogenic state, a concept reviewed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Prietl et al., 2013</xref>). The findings from this study are based on an analysis of 97 individuals divided equally between the three treatment groups. Our ability to detect differences in the effects of vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> may have been negatively impacted by the inclusion of two different ethnic groups among the 97 participants, since the transcriptome results from the two ethnic groups are clearly different. It will be very important to independently replicate this study using a much larger cohort in order to verify, or otherwise, the key findings from this study. From power calculations it is considered that for a whole human microarray-based gene expression study of this nature, and with gene expression changes of the magnitude we observe, at least 400 participants of each ethnic group should be recruited for each treatment, giving a total cohort size of 2,400. The biological interpretation of our findings in the present study should be considered as preliminary in this context, requiring independent verification.</p>
<p>It is difficult to compare the findings of the present study with other reported <italic>in vivo</italic> studies because of the considerable differences in experimental design, including the use of supra-physiological vitamin D doses (up to 2,000 &#x03BC;g single bolus doses), different population types and small sample sizes which make statistical analysis not feasible (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hossein-nezhad et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Neme et al., 2019</xref>)). Furthermore, our study is unique in that it compared gene expression in participants given either of the two commonly used forms of vitamin D, vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Intriguing, this revealed that there were considerable differences in the gene expression profiles following each nutritional treatment. For example, excluding genes that were also differentially expressed over the 12-week intervention in the placebo group, only 13&#x0025; of down-regulated differentially expressed genes were common between the two treatment groups while 28&#x0025; and 59&#x0025; were uniquely down-regulated by vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub>, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>
<p>It is questionable whether it is useful to extrapolate the results from single high dose bolus and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies such as those described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Koivisto et al., 2020</xref>) with this sustained dietary intake <italic>in vivo</italic> study. In the former study 15 &#x2018;vitamin D-responsive&#x2019; genes were identified as important mediators of innate and adaptive immunity. Five of these 15 genes are also identified as differentially expressed in our present study (<italic>CD93, CEBPB, THBD, THEMIS2</italic> and <italic>TREM1</italic>). However, in the present study these five genes were <italic>down-regul</italic>ated by vitamin D intake (<bold>Supplementary Data File 2</bold>) whereas they are reported to be up-regulated in the studies reported by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Koivisto et al., 2020</xref>). These contrasting results highlight the difficulties with comparing data from different experimental designs. As argued previously, because of the relatively small sample sizes investigated and the small effect sizes, this study has focussed on identification of statistically significant pathway enrichment following sustained vitamin D supplementation, rather than a gene-focussed analysis. Nevertheless, we consider it useful to consider the respective roles of these five specific gene products since their <italic>down</italic>-regulation by vitamin D would make sense from a biological perspective. In our study the gene encoding thymocyte selection-associated family member 2 (<italic>THEMIS2</italic>) is down-regulated after vitamin D<sub>2</sub> supplementation, the CD93-encoding gene is down-regulated following D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> supplementation, while the genes encoding thrombomodulin (<italic>THBD</italic>) and the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein beta (<italic>CEBPB</italic>) are down-regulated following D<sub>3</sub> supplementation. <italic>THBD</italic> is a key vitamin D target in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the function of reducing blood clots while at the same time preventing the pro-inflammatory consequences of NF-kB signalling. The <italic>THBD</italic> and <italic>CD93</italic> genes are next to each other, share the same super-enhancer, and their transcription start site regions respond to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D<sub>3</sub>. <italic>CEBPB</italic> encodes a transcription factor important in the regulation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. <italic>TREM1</italic> encodes triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells which stimulates neutrophil and monocyte-mediated inflammatory responses. It triggers release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, as well as increased surface expression of cell activation markers. TREM-1 amplifies inflammatory responses that are triggered by bacterial and fungal infections and is a crucial mediator of septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bouchon et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Another cellular function that is affected by vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> supplementation is chromatin modification and remodelling. The <italic>EP300</italic> gene is down-regulated by both vitamins, but unaffected in the placebo group. <italic>EP300</italic> encodes a histone acetylase that regulates transcription by chromatin remodelling, in particular histone acetylation of H3 at lysine-27, representing an epigenetic modification which activates transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hatzi et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, EP300 is also a coactivator of VDR.</p>
<p>Functional categories of genes enriched among the upregulated genes, following supplementation with either vitamin D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3,</sub> include translation, mitochondrial and spliceosome function (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Data File 4</bold>); statistically enriched biological cellular component terms in these functional categories are ribosomal proteins, components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, two subunits of the histone H4 and snRNP Sm protein components of the spliceosome assembly. It is established that, in addition to influencing transcription, vitamin D can also influence post-transcriptional events by recruiting co-regulators. In this context it is relevant that components of the spliceosome such as snRNP Sm proteins that mediate both transcriptional control and splicing decisions, leading to alternatively spliced transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), were upregulated by vitamin D supplementation in this study. These statistically significant gene expression changes were detected as temporal differences <italic>within</italic> each treatment group (differences at baseline (V1) versus 12 weeks after the intervention (V3) <italic>within</italic> single individuals). Differences in gene expression <italic>across</italic> treatment groups were only found in the South Asian group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). The SA treatment group that received supplementation with vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, revealed three genes significantly upregulated and two down-regulated after the 12-week intervention relative to the placebo group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; <bold>Supplementary Fig. 1</bold>). We note that the gene encoding cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (<italic>CREB1</italic>) is one of the three upregulated genes. It encodes a transcription factor that binds as a homodimer to the cAMP-responsive element. CREB1 protein is phosphorylated by several protein kinases, and induces transcription of genes in response to hormonal stimulation of the cAMP pathway. The protein kinase A (PKA) pathways are activated by the parathyroid hormone PTH in response to low serum calcium levels to maintain serum calcium homeostasis, primarily by promoting vitamin D 1&#x03B1;-hydroxylation in the kidney. Both PTH and 1,25 (OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D have similar effects in promoting the maturation of osteocytes and opposing the differentiation of osteoblasts into osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">St John et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">St John et al., 2014</xref>). It is relevant to note in this context that all treatment groups in the SA cohort showed elevated serum PTH at the baseline sampling point relative to the WE cohort.</p>

<title>Vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> do not influence expression of the same genes</title>
<p>Our results indicate that the cellular responses to the two forms of vitamin D supplementation have some commonalities but also show some clear differences (catalogued in <bold>Supplementary Data File 4</bold>). For example, some biological processes such as histone modification and covalent chromatin modification are downregulated following vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation only, while spliceosomal function are upregulated by vitamin D<sub>2</sub> only. In light of the finding that vitamins D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> influence expression of different genes in the human blood transcriptome, recently we undertook a parallel <italic>in vitro</italic> study with a model rat cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mengozzi et al., 2020</xref>). We examined the respective influences of the two physiologically active forms of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 1,25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> on differentiation and global gene expression in differentiating rat CG4 oligodendrocyte precursor cells and revealed considerable differences in the influence of the two types of vitamin D on gene expression at 24 h and after 72 h following onset of differentiation. We demonstrated that 1,25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 1,25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> respectively influenced expression of 1,272 and 574 genes at 24 h following addition of the vitamin to the culture, where many of the changes in expression were specific to one or the other form of the vitamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mengozzi et al., 2020</xref>). This study provides evidence of the different direct effects of the two active vitamin D metabolites on gene expression <italic>in vitro</italic> in cultured cells and provides some evidence that the changes we observed in the <italic>in vivo</italic> study may reflect the influence of the physiologically active forms of the vitamin, 1,25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 1,25(OH)D<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>Influence of vitamin D on expression of genes encoding immune pathways</title>
<p>In common to both the D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> treatment groups, but not the placebo group, we found that many different pathways of the immune system are differentially expressed (largely down-regulated) by vitamin D, consistent with the emerging theme that one physiological role of vitamin D is to suppress, or balance, the activity of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Prietl et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Martens et al., 2020</xref>)(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>; Supplementary data files 3, 4 and 5). The immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D on both innate and adaptive immunity are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Liu et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hayes and Nashold, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Teles et al., 2013</xref>). Vitamin D supplementation has the potential to ameliorate the symptoms of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, as supported by several lines of evidence: the role in promoting differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and therefore remyelination of CNS neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gomez-Pinedo et al., 2020</xref>); suppression of the differentiation of potentially pathogenic T-cells and enhancement of regulatory T-cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wasnik et al., 2020</xref>). However, a recent Cochrane review found little benefit of vitamin D in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jagannath et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>We have also found some differences in response to vitamin D in relation to ethnicity (with the caveat that the sample size of the SA group was smaller than the WE group). Ethnic differences in response are suggested from the weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). A direct correlation between the stimulation of the immune response with an increase in serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentration (and a corresponding negative correlation with the serum concentration of PTH) was evident in the SA group only. This is the opposite of that observed in the WE group where the effect of vitamin D supplementation was to suppress immune pathways.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The transcriptome results from this study differ from those of previous <italic>in vivo</italic> studies which used supra-physiological doses of vitamin D over a short time-frame, or used <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured cells. Indeed, where there is overlap in the identity of the differentially expressed genes identified in the respective studies vitamin D appears to exert the opposite effect relative to our longer-term repeated physiological dose study. Short-term responses to large boluses are relatively simple to do, and less prone to noise, but their effect on gene expression does not seem to be consistent with that observed with longer term repeated physiological dose studies like the present study and therefore may not represent the real-world effects of repeated dietary intake of vitamin D. Thus, despite the challenges and limitations of doing longer term <italic>in vivo</italic> human studies, that are complicated by seasonal variation in gene expression, inter-individual human variation, subtle physiological changes in gene expression, more &#x2018;noise&#x2019; through intake of other vitamin D sources during the treatment intervention, our work suggests it may be important to conduct more such longer term studies since the results from the shorter term interventions may not be representative of the influence of vitamin D on normal physiological gene expression. One potential criticism of whole blood transcriptome studies is that the results may not represent the gene expression changes that occur in other tissues as a result of vitamin D supplementation. However, we have shown, in comparable whole blood transcriptome studies of human sleep physiology, that the changes in the human blood transcriptome correlate with the changes that are observed in other tissues and organs in comparable mammalian animal studies, giving us some confidence in the physiological relevance of the changes identified in this vitamin D transcriptome study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Archer et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Moller-Levet et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The transcriptome results differ considerably between the two different ethnic groups. While some of the differences may be attributable to differences in sample sizes studied between the two groups it is also possible that some of the differences represent genuine differences in the respective physiological responses of the two ethnic groups. Alternatively, the differences may reflect the starting physiological status of the SA participant group, who were found to have considerably lower baseline vitamin D concentrations (and higher PTH concentrations) than the WE group. The importance of clarifying these different responses is given particular impetus by the emerging evidence for the interplay between ethnicity, skin tone, vitamin D status and susceptibility to viral infection, COVID-19 being of particular current relevance here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lanham-New et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kohlmeier, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kmietowicz, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Weir et al., 2020</xref>). The transcriptomic data presented in this study might provide a useful context for further studies aimed at understanding the role of vitamin D in influencing the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in relation to severe COVID-19.</p>
<p>In summary our results indicate that whilst the two forms of vitamin D (D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub>) exert some overlapping roles in human physiology, each form may elicit different molecular responses, findings which warrant a more detailed consideration of the system-wide effects of these two forms vitamin D. Clearly, this type of study requires replication, using a much larger independent cohort, with balanced representation from different ethnic groups. This is perhaps of particular importance to at-risk ethnic groups, including black and South Asian populations who reside in northern latitudes. The studies would need to be time course-based (temporal) to track gene expression changes <italic>within</italic> individuals from baseline activity to defined sampling times and would need in-built control to account for seasonal gene expression changes. They would need to be designed specifically to answer whether different ethnicity or different vitamin D baseline levels give rise to different responses to vitamin D supplementation.</p>
<p>Since some pathways appear to be regulated specifically by vitamin D<sub>3,</sub> future studies should investigate whether vitamin D<sub>2</sub> supplementation might counteract some of the benefits of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on human health. This possibility is prompted by the findings from this cohort that the circulating concentration of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> within vitamin D<sub>2</sub>-treated participants was significantly lower after the 12-week intervention than in the placebo group who received no vitamin D supplements &#x2013; suggesting that the former might be depleted by the latter. The results from this study suggest that guidelines on food fortification and supplementation with specific forms of vitamin D may need revisiting.</p>

<title>Blood Transcriptome analysis</title>
<p>The recruitment of individuals as part of the BBSRC D2-D3 Study was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tripkovic et al., 2017</xref>). This study received ethical approval from the South-East Coast (Surrey) National Health Service Research Ethics Committee (11/LO/0708) and the University of Surrey Ethics Committee (EC/2011/97/FHMS). All of the participants gave written informed consent in agreement with the Helsinki Declaration before commencing study activities. Briefly, 335 women of both South Asian (SA) and white European (WE) descent were randomised to one of three intervention groups for 12-weeks and provided with daily doses of vitamin D within fortified foods: placebo, 15 &#x03BC;g/d vitamin D2 or 15&#x03BC;g/d vitamin D3. Of the 335 participants, 97 were selected for transcriptome analysis (32 were WE, 32 were A and 33 were selected at random from both ethnic groups to form a balanced placebo group). High responders (&#x003E;50&#x0025; increase in 25OHD concentrations) and low responders (&#x003C;50&#x0025; increase in 25OHD concentrations) were included within both vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> supplementation groups to maximize the chance of observing differences in gene expression among subjects. The selected time points for transcriptome analysis were V1 representing the baseline and V3, 12 weeks after treatment commenced.</p>
<p>Whole peripheral blood (2.5 ml) was collected using PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (Becton Dickinson). PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes were inverted ten times immediately after drawing blood, stored upright at 15-25&#x00B0;C for 24 hours, followed by a &#x2212;20&#x00B0;C freezer for 24 hours and then into a &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C freezer for long-term storage.</p>
<p>Transcriptomic analysis was conducted essentially as described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Archer et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Moller-Levet et al., 2013</xref>). Total RNA was isolated using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturers recommendations. cRNA was synthesised and fluorescently labelled with Cy3-CTP from 200 ng of total RNA using the Low Input QuickAmp Labelling Kit, One Color (Agilent Technology). Labelled cRNA was hybridised on a Sure Print G3 Human Gene Expression 8 &#x00D7; 60K v2 microarray slide (Agilent Technologies). Standard manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions for one colour gene-expression analysis were followed for labelling, hybridsation and washing steps. Extracted RNA was quantified using NanoDrop ND2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). RNA quality and integrity was evaluated using either the Bioanalyzer 2100 or the TapeStation 4200 (Agilent Technologies). Only RNA samples with an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of &#x003E;7.0 were subjected to DNA microarray analysis. Microarrays were hybridised at 65&#x00B0;C for 17 hours in an Agilent Hybridization Oven on a rotisserie at 10 rpm. The washed microarrays were scanned using an Agilent Microarray Scanner with a resolution of 2 &#x03BC;m.</p>

<title>Transcriptome data processing and differential expression analysis</title>
<p>Raw scanned microarray images were processed using Agilent Feature Extraction software (v11.5.1.1) with the Agilent 039494_D_F_20140326_human_8&#x00D7;60K_v2 grid, and then imported into R for normalization and analysis using the LIMMA package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). Microarray data were background-corrected using the &#x2018;normexp&#x2019; method (with an offset of 50) and quantile normalised, producing expression values in the log base 2 scale. The processed data were then filtered to remove probes exhibiting low signals across the arrays, retaining non-control probes that are at least 10&#x0025; brighter than negative control probe signals on at least 41 arrays (&#x223C;20&#x0025; of the arrays in the analysis). Data from identical replicate probes were then averaged to produce expression values at the unique probe level. Initial data exploration identified one sample (participant 0017, V3 time point) with array data that was a notable outlier from the group and therefore both the V1 and V3 microarrays for this subject were excluded from all subsequent analysis, reprocessing the data as above in their absence before proceeding.</p>
<p>Tests for differential expression were performed using LIMMA, applying appropriate linear model designs to identify: (i) significant differences in the transcriptional responses occurring across the 12-week V1 to V3 period of the study between the treatment and placebo groups for each ethnic cohort (example contrasts tested, in the format ethnicity_treatment_time: (WE_D2_V3 - WE_D2_V1) - (WE_P_V3-WE_P_V1) = 0, and (WE_D3_V3 - WE_D3_V1) - (WE_P_V3 - WE_P_V1) = 0); and ii) to determine significant changes for each ethnic cohort within each treatment group between the V3 and V1 sampling points, blocking on subject identity (example contrasts tested: WE_D2_V3 - WE_D2_V1 = 0, WE_D3_V3 - WE_D3_V1 = 0). Blocking on subject identity was used to control for inter-subject variability. Significance p-values were corrected for multiplicity using the Benjamini and Hochberg method, obtaining adjusted p-values (adj.P.Val). Normalised data for all participants (V3 &#x2013; V1) was assessed by principal component analysis to screen for any batch effects (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3</bold>).</p>

<title>Functional enrichment and network analysis</title>
<p>Functional enrichment analysis of lists of genes of interest possessing valid ENTREZ gene identifiers was performed using the R package clusterProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) The software produces adjusted p-values (p.adjust) using the Benjamini and Hochberg correction method. Construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction networks from sets of genes was undertaken in Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>) using the STRING plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Szklarczyk et al., 2017a</xref>). Cytoscape was also used to construct and visualise commonality in the functional categories identified as being significantly enriched in the genes responding to the experimental treatments. To visualise categories identified from the D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> treatment groups but not from the placebo (e.g. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) significantly enriched categories (p.adjust &#x003C; 0.01) from all groups were imported such that treatment group nodes (D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and placebo (P)) are linked to functional category nodes by edges assigned the corresponding p.adjust values. All nodes with an edge connection to the placebo treatment node were then removed and the resulting networks further filtered to retain only those nodes with at least one edge connection with p.adjust&#x003C;=0.001.</p>
<p>Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed in R using the WGCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>) and CoExpNets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Botia, 2019</xref>) packages. A normalised expression data matrix generated by filtering to retain probes with signals more markedly above background (30&#x0025; brighter than negative control probe signals on at least 41 arrays) was used as input, consisting of 12,169 unique probes. Signed scale-free networks were constructed separately for the data for the SA and WE ethnic groups using 50 iterations of the k-means clustering option in the CoExpNets &#x2018;getDownstreamNetwork&#x2019; function to refine the clustering process (<bold>Supplementary Data File 6</bold>). Pearson correlations between cluster module eigengenes and metadata for serum 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub>, 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, total 25(OH)D and PTH concentrations were calculated using pairwise complete observations.</p>
