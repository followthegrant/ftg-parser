<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Objectives</title>
<p>Recent observations in systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) suggest an increasing incidence of high-mortality interstitial lung disease, characterized by a variant of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). Co-occurrence of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and PAP in sJIA suggested a shared pathology, but sJIA-PAP patients also commonly experience features of drug reaction such as atypical rashes and eosinophilia. We sought to investigate immunopathology and identify biomarkers in sJIA, MAS, and sJIA-PAP.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We used SOMAscan to measure &#x003E;1300 analytes in sera from healthy controls and patients with sJIA, MAS, sJIA-PAP and other related diseases. We verified selected findings by ELISA and lung immunostaining. Because the proteome of a sample may reflect multiple states (sJIA, MAS, sJIA-PAP), we used regression modeling to identify subsets of altered proteins associated with each state. We tested key findings in a validation cohort.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Proteome alterations in active sJIA and MAS overlapped substantially, including known sJIA biomarkers like SAA and S100A9, and novel elevations of heat shock proteins and glycolytic enzymes. IL-18 was elevated in all sJIA groups, particularly MAS and sJIA-PAP. We also identified an MAS-independent sJIA-PAP signature notable for elevated ICAM5, MMP7, and allergic/eosinophilic chemokines, which were all previously associated with lung damage. Immunohistochemistry localized ICAM5 and MMP7 in sJIA-PAP lung. ICAM5&#x2019;s ability to distinguish sJIA-PAP from sJIA/MAS was independently validated.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Serum proteins support an sJIA-to-MAS continuum, help distinguish sJIA, sJIA/MAS, and sJIA-PAP, and suggest etiologic hypotheses. Select biomarkers, such as ICAM5, could aid in early detection and management of sJIA-PAP.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of childhood characterized by a combination of systemic inflammation, quotidian fever, evanescent rash, adenopathy/organomegly, serositis, and arthritis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Its adult equivalent is adult-onset Still&#x2019;s disease (AOSD)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a life-threatening form of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) that complicates about 10&#x0025; of patients with sJIA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. It is characterized by cytokine storm, very high serum ferritin, progression to organ failure, and a mortality of up to 17&#x0025;. Active sJIA and MAS may share a common etiology, representing a spectrum of disease severity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>For decades, pleuritis and pleural effusions were the typical lung manifestations identified in sJIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. In recent years, pediatric rheumatologists have increasingly observed sJIA patients who developed acute digital clubbing and an insidious parenchymal lung disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The predominant pathology of this new lung disease is a variant of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP)/endogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP), with increased inflammatory infiltrate, pulmonary arterial wall thickening, but little fibrosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Nearly all cases with this pathology were exposed to IL-1 and/or IL-6 inhibition, and the drug-exposed group demonstrated other clinical features atypical for sJIA, such as acute erythematous clubbing, atypical rash, eosinophilia, and anaphylaxis to tocilizumab[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Though the initial descriptions were associated with severe sJIA (with MAS in 80&#x0025;)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], larger follow-up series suggested that MAS at sJIA onset was not associated with the unusual clinical features of the sJIA-PAP group, and some patients with treatment-responsive sJIA nevertheless developed lung disease. However, 78&#x0025; had overt or subclinical MAS at the detection of or during lung disease, suggesting lung disease may stimulate MAS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>To better understand the underlying pathology and relationships between sJIA and its complications MAS and sJIA-PAP, we assembled serum proteomes from a multi-center cohort of sJIA patients with or without these complications and relevant comparators (monogenic autoinflammatory diseases and PAP from other causes). We also sought to identify biomarkers that might aid in detecting or monitoring PAP in sJIA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Cohort &#x0026; Disease Definitions</title>
<p>Several names have been used for the syndrome of digital clubbing and PAP-variant parenchymal lung disease observed in sJIA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Herein, we use the term &#x201C;sJIA-PAP&#x201D; to identify patients known or strongly suspected to have this constellation of features <bold>(Supplementary Table 1)</bold>. Clinical data and serum from sJIA-PAP, healthy controls, inactive sJIA, active sJIA, MAS, hereditary/autoimmune PAP, STING-associated Vasculopathy of Infancy (SAVI, all with interstitial lung disease, prior to Jak inhibitor therapy), Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID, prior to IL-1 blockade), and NLRC4-MAS were collected under ongoing protocols using established diagnostic, classification, or genetic criteria. Notably, arthritis was not required for classification as sJIA. The study included a discovery cohort comprised of all groups above, as well as a validation cohort consisting of only samples from controls and sJIA patients (see <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supplemental Table 1</bold>, and <bold>Supplemental Methods)</bold>.</p>

</table-wrap>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Serum protein analysis</title>
<p>For the discovery cohort, we profiled serum samples by SOMAscan assay (SOMAlogic, Boulder, CO), an aptamer-based proteomics platform[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], in collaboration with the NIH Center for Human Immunology. 1271 analytes were evaluated, with most being mapped to a single protein (exceptions are listed in <bold>Supplementary Tables 2-4</bold>). IL-18 was assessed by Luminex. CXCL9 and IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) were measured by both SOMAscan and Luminex to verify reproducibility (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1</bold>). We performed ICAM-5 ELISA on remnant sera from the discovery cohort as a technical verification. Serum and plasma samples from an independent validation cohort were assayed for IL-18 and CXCL9 by Luminex and ICAM-5 and MMP7 by ELISA. <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supplementary Table 1</bold>, and <bold>Supplemental Methods</bold> contain further details.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Linear Regression-Based Modeling Analysis</title>
<p>A schematic overview of the study is shown in <bold>Supplementary Figure 2A</bold>. Patients&#x2019; disease, and therefore their proteomes, may reflect multiple disease components (e.g., patients with sJIA-PAP may have an active sJIA disease component). Thus, our analysis required distinguishing patient groups from disease components, with some overlap of disease and component names (e.g., the active sJIA group vs. the sJIA disease component). Likewise, components can contribute to the proteomes of multiple disease groups (e.g., MAS disease component in MAS and sJIA-PAP patient samples). To capture the serum proteome alterations attributed to a specific disease component, we used LIMMA (Linear Models for Microarray Data), in which the overall proteome alteration was regressed against the disease component(s) present in each individual patient <bold>(Supplementary Figure 2B-C)</bold>. We used these disease components to assign disease (sJIA, MAS, sJIA/PAP) activity scores to individual samples. For details on LIMMA, disease component construction, and calculating disease activity scores, see <bold>Supplemental Methods</bold>.</p>

<sec id="s3a">
<title>A discovery cohort including sJIA, MAS, sJIA-PAP and related inflammatory conditions</title>
<p>We included 151 serum samples from 120 patients for proteomic profiling using SOMAscan. The patients represented 10 patient groups, based on clinical characterizations <bold>(<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supplementary Table 1)</bold>. Most samples and patients were from five main groups that we analyzed by linear regression: healthy controls (n=21), inactive sJIA (28), active sJIA (24), MAS (10), and sJIA-PAP (10), <bold>(Supplemental Methods)</bold>. The sJIA-PAP samples were divided into those with high levels of both ferritin and CRP (sJIA-PAP<sup>FCHi</sup>) and those without (sJIA-PAP<sup>FCLo</sup>, <bold>Supplementary Figures 3A-B)</bold>. All sJIA-PAP patient samples were collected during or following exposure to IL-1 and or IL-6 inhibitors <bold>(Supplementary Table 1)</bold>.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Determine the proteome changes associated with each disease component</title>
<p>In all patient sera studied, the proteome in a single sample may reflect contributions of multiple concurrent pathologic processes <bold>(Supplementary Figure 2)</bold>. A central goal of this study was to capture the serum proteome alterations attributed to a specific disease component (sJIA, MAS or sJIA-PAP), as distinguished from the disease groups (see above and <bold>Supplemental Methods</bold>). We used Limma to determine the statistically significant differences associated with each disease component <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>, Supplementary Figures 2B-C)</bold>.</p>

<title>MAS further exaggerates many molecular changes present in sJIA</title>
<p>We first characterized the sJIA and MAS components. For the sJIA component (active sJIA versus healthy controls), we found 86 significantly altered proteins, with most (85&#x0025;) elevated in the sJIA group <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Supplementary Table 2)</bold>. Many of these proteins, including ferritin (<italic>FTH1</italic>), IL-18, CRP and S100A12 <bold>(Supplementary Figures 3C-F)</bold>, have been previously associated with sJIA using other techniques, supporting the validity of SOMAscan measurements. We also identified several proteins not typically associated with sJIA, such as MMP3 (a protease induced by IL-6[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]), and various metabolic enzymes, including GAPDH, NAGK, HK, and GPI.</p>
<p>We also compared profiles of inactive sJIA patients to healthy controls. Seven proteins were significantly different <bold>(Supplementary Figure 4)</bold>, including the IL-10 induced monokine CCL16, consistent with a state of compensated inflammation in inactive sJIA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The analysis of the MAS component compared patients with active sJIA to those with MAS and identified 105 significantly different proteins <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Supplementary Table 3)</bold>. These included many glycolytic enzymes (e.g., GAPDH, LDH) and several chaperone proteins (e.g., HSP70, HSP90). We calculated a MAS serum activity score to quantify the MAS component within each sample (see <bold>Supplemental Methods</bold>). We excluded CRP and ferritin from the score, as these were often used by submitting investigators to define MAS. As expected, the MAS score (even without CRP and ferritin) was significantly greater in MAS than sJIA <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>)</bold> and was significantly correlated with ferritin (Spearman correlation test, rho=0.57, p&#x003C;2.2e-16) and CRP (rho=0.5, p=1.5e-09) <bold>(Supplementary Figures 5A-B)</bold>. The MAS serum activity score was also higher in patients with active versus inactive NLRC4-MAS <bold>(Supplementary Figure 5C)</bold>. In linear regression model, each protein received a coefficient reflecting its contribution to the component <bold>(Supplemental Methods)</bold>. We observed a strong correlation between the protein abundance coefficients associated with sJIA and MAS disease components <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, Supplementary Figure 5D)</bold>, suggesting MAS further exaggerated a serum proteome already altered in sJIA.</p>

<p>Examining the top altered proteins in the sJIA and MAS disease components <bold>(Supplementary Tables 2-4)</bold>, we found a few proteins whose functional relationship was novel or unclear. Specifically, heat shock proteins Hsp70 (HSPA1A, HSPA8) and Hsp90 (HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1) were upregulated in many patients, particularly in MAS <bold>(Supplementary Table 3, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>)</bold>.

We performed Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis on the proteins significantly changed for each disease component <bold>(Supplementary Table 5)</bold>. Consistent with systemic immune activation, proteins involved in GO term &#x201C;leukocyte mediated immunity&#x201D; <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>)</bold> were elevated in both the sJIA and MAS disease components.

<title>Serum alterations associated with lung disease can occur independent of MAS activity in patients with sJIA-PAP</title>
<p>Active sJIA or MAS did not appear to sufficiently explain sJIA-PAP disease activity, as we observed a low MAS score in many sJIA-PAP samples, and previous clinical data showed sJIA-PAP could arise in the absence of MAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Therefore, we sought to identify the proteins driving an sJIA-PAP disease component. To track whether sJIA-PAP samples with strong MAS features biased or confounded identification of the sJIA-PAP component, the sJIA-PAP samples were divided into those with high levels of both ferritin and CRP (sJIA-PAP<sup>FCHi</sup>) and those without (sJIA-PAP<sup>FCLo</sup>). The active sJIA and sJIA-PAP<sup>FCLo</sup> groups had comparable MAS serum activity scores. The sJIA-PAP<sup>FCHi</sup> group had significantly higher MAS serum activity scores than the active sJIA or sJIA-PAP<sup>FCLo</sup> groups but trended toward lower MAS serum activity scores than the MAS group <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>)</bold>. This suggests significant smoldering MAS activity in some sJIA-PAP samples even though none were obtained during periods meeting clinical MAS criteria. Comparing sJIA-PAP patients to sJIA and MAS patients identified 26 proteins (20 up, 6 down) significantly associated with the sJIA-PAP disease component, including ICAM5, MMP7, and CCL11/Eotaxin-1 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>, see <bold>Supplemental Methods</bold> on adjustment for MAS activity confounding). Using these proteins, we calculated the sJIA-PAP serum activity score (see <bold>Supplemental Methods</bold>) and found it was higher in sJIA-PAP samples than in either active sJIA or MAS, as expected <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>)</bold>. Unlike the MAS serum activity score, the sJIA-PAP serum activity score did not differ between the sJIA-PAP<sup>FCLo</sup> and sJIA-PAP<sup>FCHi</sup> groups, and both groups had substantially higher sJIA-PAP serum activity than the MAS group <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, Supplementary Figure 6A)</bold>. The small elevation of the sJIA-PAP activity score in the MAS group was entirely attributable to IL-18 <bold>(Supplementary Figure 6A vs. B)</bold>. As expected by the model design, there was no correlation between the protein abundance coefficients of the sJIA-PAP-component and those of the MAS component <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, Supplementary Figure 6C)</bold>. Notably, the sJIA-PAP serum activity score was higher in sJIA-PAP than in primary PAP caused by GM-CSF-neutralizing autoantibodies or surfactant-related mutations <bold>(Supplementary Figures 6A-B)</bold>.</p>
<p>Half of the sJIA-PAP patients had four or more timepoints analyzed by SOMAscan. When we traced the disease component-specific serum activity scores longitudinally, the sJIA-PAP serum activity score did not correlate with sJIA or MAS serum activity scores <bold>(Supplementary Figure 7)</bold>. Overall, these findings corroborate clinical observations suggesting that sJIA-PAP may be triggered by a mechanism distinct from sJIA, MAS, and other well-characterized PAP conditions.</p>

CCL17/TARC, CCL11/eotaxin-1, and CCL2/MCP-1 are potent chemoattractants for Th2 cells, eosinophils, and myeloid cells, respectively.

<title>ICAM5 is a potential biomarker for sJIA-PAP</title>
<p>ICAM5 was one of the proteins most significantly associated with sJIA-PAP in the discovery cohort <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Supplementary Figure 10)</bold>. To verify the SOMAscan ICAM5 findings, we measured ICAM5 by ELISA in 80 remnant samples previously profiled with SOMAscan. As with CXCL9 and IL-18BP <bold>(Supplementary Figure 1)</bold>, we found a strong correlation between ELISA and SOMAscan results <bold>(Supplementary Figure 11)</bold>. Accordingly, only sJIA-PAP samples showed ICAM5 elevation by ELISA, although ELISA showed poorer sensitivity than SOMAscan at low concentrations. ICAM5 function has been best-characterized in the nervous system due to high expression in the brain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. However, an autopsy dataset of healthy adults (Genome-Tissue Expression)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] showed ICAM5 expression in the lung comparable to that seen in the CNS <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>)</bold>. MMP7, a matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) that efficiently cleaves ICAM5 <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], was also significantly elevated in sJIA-PAP sera <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Supplementary Figure 10)</bold>, and we found a significant correlation between serum concentrations of ICAM5 and MMP7 <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>)</bold>.

<p>To determine whether proteins identified by SOMAscan profiling of serum samples were also expressed in lung tissue, we used immunostaining to evaluate lung biopsies from 8 patients with sJIA-PAP, 3 with genetic disorders in surfactant metabolism (<italic>SFTPC, NKX2</italic>.<italic>1</italic>, and <italic>GATA2</italic>), 1 with idiopathic ILD, and 3 controls (asthma/aspiration, bronchopneumonia, and normal lung adjacent to tumor). Consistent with our prior evaluation of sJIA-PAP histology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], lungs from sJIA-PAP patients exhibited the characteristic pattern of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) and/or endogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] with mixed acute and chronic inflammatory cells and rare interstitial fibrosis <bold>(Supplementary Table 6 &#x0026; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>)</bold>. Lung pathology from the patients with genetic disorders in surfactant metabolism showed a similar spectrum of PAP/ELP with more prominent fibrosis.</p>
<p>All samples showed membrane-associated ICAM5 that was largely restricted to interstitial fibroblasts, confirmed by double-labeling with the epithelial marker cytokeratin 7 <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, Supplementary Figure 12)</bold>. ICAM5 expression was especially prominent in Case 1 (sJIA-PAP) and Case 9 (GATA2) (Supplementary Table 6), and overall proportional to the number of interstitial fibroblasts (data not shown). MMP7 was expressed rarely in some macrophages (marked by CD163) and epithelial cells <bold>(Supplementary Table 6, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, Supplementary Figure 13)</bold>.</p>
<p>We also stained several other proteins that were identified by SOMAscan. IL-18 staining was limited in non-ILD controls but increased within macrophages, inflammatory cells, and epithelial cells in both sJIA and other ILD cases. In most biopsies, galectin-3 was expressed strongly in alveolar macrophages and more mildly in bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. Robust expression of CCL2 was observed in the presence of neutrophilic and monocytic inflammation. Rare monocytes and macrophages expressed CCL17 in sJIA cases. <bold>(Supplementary Table 6 and data not shown)</bold></p>

<title>Validation of ICAM5 as a biomarker for lung diseases in sJIA</title>
<p>We next organized an independent multi-center validation cohort consisting of 49 serum samples and 29 plasma samples from healthy controls, inactive sJIA, active sJIA, MAS, sJIA-PAP <bold>(Supplementary Table 7)</bold>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Serum proteome profiles can provide clues to pathogenesis as well as clinically actionable biomarkers and can be particularly useful to investigate novel complications of diseases, such as PAP/ELP arising in sJIA patients. To approach both biological and clinical questions concerning sJIA and its serious complications, MAS and PAP, we measured serum levels of 1271 proteins using SOMAscan, verified selected data from this platform using an antibody-based approach and, importantly, validated key results in an independent cohort. Our analyses yielded several insights. First, they provided an unbiased confirmation of known biomarkers of sJIA (S100 proteins, SAA, CRP, IL-6) and MAS (ferritin, IL-18) and also corroborated the more recent finding of elevated IL-18 in sJIA-PAP cases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Second, they identified new proteins/pathways of potential utility in understanding sJIA and MAS, including glycolytic enzymes and heat shock proteins that can act as extracellular DAMPs. Correlation analyses suggested that the sJIA and MAS serum proteomes were related. Finally, the proteins associated with sJIA-PAP reflected inflammation programs distinct from sJIA/MAS. Immunostaining identified cells in lung that may be important sources of serum proteins associated with sJIA-PAP. We validated ICAM5 as a biomarker of lung disease in an independent set of sJIA samples, most usefully in association with sJIA-PAP.</p>
<p>Among the novel proteins identified in the MAS profile, the HSPs may reflect an unfolded protein response, such as that reported to sustain macrophage survival in atherosclerotic lesions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. However, these chaperone proteins also play extracellular roles in wound healing, tissue regeneration, and immune responses[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Their elevated serum concentration may reflect stress-induced secretion or cell death[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Inflammatory forms of cell death (pyroptosis, necroptosis, etc.) are capable of releasing alarmins and DAMPs, such as HSPs, S100 proteins, and IL-33.</p>
<p>In addition, glycolysis-associated proteins <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, D)</bold> were associated with the sJIA and MAS components. Increasingly, aerobic glycolysis is recognized as a necessary metabolic state to execute inflammatory programs in many immune cell types. Animal studies suggest inhibiting glycolysis may be therapeutic in cytokine storms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Many glycolytic enzymes &#x201C;moonlight&#x201D; as regulators of inflammatory responses[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The sJIA and MAS serum programs also included many neutrophil/monocyte proteins (e.g., S100 proteins, PR3, MPO, lipocalin-2, CD163, CD177, <bold>Supplementary Tables 2 and 3</bold>), possibly reflecting their secretion and/or release during cell death.</p>
<p>A high frequency of MAS in sJIA-PAP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] suggested a connection between sJIA-PAP and the IL-18-interferon gamma (IFN&#x03B3;) axis underlying MAS. Indeed, sJIA-PAP patients&#x2019; peripheral blood often carries an IFN transcriptional signature[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. In our data, a portion of sJIA-PAP sera (sJIA-PAP<sup>FCHi</sup>) showed elevated CXCL9 and CXCL10 at levels similar to those of the MAS group, although CXCL9 and CXCL10 were not consistently elevated in a previous analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from six sJIA-PAP patients[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Combined, these data could be consistent with a role for MAS up- or downstream of PAP <bold>(Supplementary Figure 14)</bold>. Notably, sJIA-PAP was reported in some patients without preceding MAS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. We found the sJIA-PAP signature did not correlate with MAS serum activity across patients <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D,F</xref>)</bold> or timepoints <bold>(Supplementary Figure 7)</bold>, and many cytokines/chemokines had similar abundance in both sJIA-PAP<sup>FCLo</sup> and sJIA-PAP<sup>FCHi</sup> groups <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>)</bold>. Our data demonstrate that the sJIA-PAP proteome can be present without high MAS activity, supporting the independent origin model <bold>(Supplementary Figure 14B)</bold>. The implication of this model is that treatments targeting the parallel sJIA and MAS proteome patterns (anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6, anti-IFN&#x03B3;) may be insufficient to manage sJIA-PAP. However, it is also possible that MAS activity is necessary for PAP (either initiation and/or progression), and the sJIA-PAP component indicates lung-specific damage/healing responses rather than a primary pathologic process. Understanding the interaction between the IL-18/IFN&#x03B3; axis and PAP development will be crucial as therapies targeting this axis become available[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>].</p>
<p>A more practical clinical concern is the need for diagnostic and monitoring biomarkers for sJIA-PAP. LDH, surfactant proteins, and MUC-1 (the source of the KL-6 antigen) are biomarkers commonly associated with lung disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Of these, we only observed elevation of LDH in sJIA-PAP <bold>(Supplementary Figure 10)</bold>, and it was also elevated in sJIA and MAS. Our findings in two independent cohorts suggest ICAM5 and MMP7 may serve better to identify lung disease distinct from sJIA/MAS activity.</p>
<p>However, it is unlikely that they are specific to sJIA-PAP. We found elevated MMP7 in autoimmune/hereditary PAP, and elevation of both ICAM5 and MMP7 in a few patients with SAVI-related ILD <bold>(Supplementary Figure 10)</bold>. In our validation cohort, using more available antibody-based methods, ICAM5 consistently and specifically increased in sJIA-PAP, compared to sJIA and MAS. In line with our hypothesis, ICAM5 appeared also to be elevated in cases with pneumonia or pulmonary hypertension, but normal in an sJIA patient with a distant history of lung disease that had resolved at sampling <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, Supplementary Table 1)</bold>. Elevation of ICAM5 was reported in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD (RA-ILD)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from neuroendocrine hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] <bold>(Supplementary Table 8)</bold>.</p>
<p>In previous reports, the tissue or cell of origin for these biomarkers was not studied. We found ICAM5 predominantly in interstitial fibroblasts by immunostaining <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>)</bold>, and in fibroblasts, type II alveolar (AT2) cells, and ciliated cells by RNA-sequencing[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] <bold>(Supplementary Figure 15)</bold>. MMP7 has been shown to efficiently cleave ICAM5 and is also elevated in various other ILDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. We hypothesize that ICAM5 elevation in blood may be traced back to lung-specific activity of proteases like MMP7 in sJIA-PAP, and the marker pair may be elevated in a variety of lung diseases.</p>
<p>Cytokines/chemokines contributing to the sJIA-PAP component, particularly CCL17/TARC, CCL7/MCP3, CCL25, GDF15/MIC-1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] and CCL11/eotaxin-1 <bold>(Supplementary Table 8)</bold>, could be part of pro-fibrotic and/or type 2 immune responses. They, along with MMP7, have been elevated in the proteomic profiles of other ILDs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. In a mouse model, expression of a PAP-causing surfactant mutant led to overexpression of CCL17, CCL7, and MMP7 proteins in AT2 cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. CCL11 has a profibrotic effect in the lung[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. These sJIA-PAP-associated chemokines also are induced during Type 2 immune responses[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Lung biopsies in sJIA-PAP, even from children with long-standing disease, showed remarkably little fibrosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], possibly due to the young age of the subjects. Previously, we reported atypical rashes (56&#x0025;) and eosinophilia (37&#x0025;) during treatment with IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitors in sJIA-PAP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. These clinical findings, a minimally-fibrotic lung pathology, recent evidence for a remarkable HLA association[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], and the above serum chemokine elevations (particularly CCL11 and CCL17), are together consistent with a delayed-type drug hypersensitivity reaction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. In the current study, we were unable to analyze the impact of IL-1/IL-6 inhibitors on the serum proteome profile, as all the sJIA-PAP patients were under IL-1 or 6 inhibition at sample collection.</p>
<p>This exploratory study has several limitations. First, though the largest to date, our limited sJIA-PAP sample size may not reflect the between-patient heterogeneity or capture the temporal spectrum of this syndrome. Secondly, because all sJIA/MAS/sJIA-PAP patients were being treated at sampling (sometimes with two or more agents), we cannot exclude confounding by disease activity and treatment. However, we previously observed little treatment variation between sJIA-PAP and sJIA patients of comparable disease activity without PAP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] suggesting small between-group differences in treatment. Nonetheless, clinical/treatment heterogeneity could contribute to biomarker heterogeneity, such as the variability we observed in levels of CXCL9/10, two chemokines rapidly responsive to treatment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], in the MAS group <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>)</bold>. More recent population biomarker studies highlight the practical value of validated findings in clinically heterogeneous cohorts, leading to successful translation into point-of-care diagnostics[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].</p>
<p>We have leveraged a novel, high-dimensional proteomics platform to identify serum proteins relevant to sJIA, MAS, and the life-threatening development of lung immunopathology; and we have used complementary techniques to localize and validate the results. Unbiased analyses reinforced the primacy of known biomarkers for sJIA and MAS and highlighted novel markers and pathways. Analysis of sJIA-PAP revealed features of smoldering MAS in many, but also a distinct serum proteome with features of lung-specific inflammation, damage repair, and/or hypersensitivity responses. Further, we identified a biomarker (ICAM5) that may be useful to screen for or monitor lung disease in children for whom functional or radiologic testing may be impractical or high-risk. Prospective, longitudinal studies of biomarkers like ICAM5 in patients with sJIA are warranted to directly test their diagnostic and/or prognostic value. Finally, our data can serve as a resource to investigators, clinicians, and families grappling with the management of sJIA, MAS, and PAP.</p>
