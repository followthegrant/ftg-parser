<title>Research Letter</title>
<p>New Zealand has a strategy of eliminating SARS-CoV-2 that has resulted in a low incidence of coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19). The first case was reported on February 26<sup>th</sup> 2020, and the country entered a strict nationwide lockdown one month later for 49 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Through rigorous border control and managed isolation and quarantine facilities for new arrivals, New Zealand has since remained largely COVID-19 free. Globally, serological surveillance has been utilized throughout the pandemic to define cumulative incidence, including estimations of missed cases and/or asymptomatic infection. Due to lockdowns and movement restrictions, blood donors have been used as a sentinel population in many settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The aim of this study was to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in New Zealand via a blood donor serosurvey. Though the pandemic response has been highly effective, PCR testing was initially restricted due to limited diagnostic reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and there have been occasional border incursions and small community outbreaks, including a cluster in August 2020 with no identified link to the border.</p>
<p>Samples were collected by the New Zealand Blood Service via 9 static collection centers and 36 mobile collection services over a 4-week period (December 3<sup>rd</sup> 2020 - January 6<sup>th</sup> 2021) from individuals aged 16 to 88 years. Duplicates were removed, leaving 9,806 samples for analysis. Compared with the 2018 New Zealand census, participants were more likely to be aged 40-59 years (43.3% versus 25.9%) and of European ethnicity (77.8% versus 61.0%) but had a similar proportion of females (49.1% versus 50.7%) and were geographically spread with 16 of 20 district health board regions represented (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Appendix). This study was assessed by the Health and Disability Ethics Committee, and additional consent was not required (21/CEN/21).</p>

<p>The New Zealand blood service donations were collected between the 3<sup>rd</sup> of December 2020 and the 6<sup>th</sup> of January 2021. Of the 9,806 individuals, 9,771 are blood donors and 35 are living tissue and stem cell donors. All donors must be free of illness and weigh &#x003E;50 kg. Notable travel and a history SARS-CoV-2 infection (or contact with a positive case) are recorded prior to collection. Demographics for COVID-19 cases were obtained from the New Zealand Ministry of Health and includes probable and confirmed infections up to and including the 6<sup>th</sup> of January 2021. The most recent New Zealand census took place in March 2018. Priority ethnicity is reported as defined by the New Zealand Department of Statistics.

<p>Antibodies to the Spike (S) protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD) persist for many months after infection, compared with antibodies to the nucleocapsid (N) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), providing rationale for the use of S protein-based assays in serosurveys. The overall serological testing algorithm was optimized for specificity given the low number of reported COVID-19 cases in New Zealand (2,190 as of January 6<sup>th</sup> 2021) and the associated period prevalence of 0.04%, which limits the positive predictive value of tests with reduced specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Samples were first screened with a widely used and well-validated 2-step ELISA that comprises a single point dilution assay against the RBD followed by titration against trimeric S protein (Appendix) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Samples above the cut-off were tested on two further immunoassays &#x2013; the EuroImmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (EuroImmun AG, L&#x00FC;beck, Germany) and the cPass surrogate Viral Neutralization Test (sVNT) (GenScript, New Jersey, USA) and deemed seropositive if above the cut-off on both commercial assays. Sensitivity and specificity for these assays were determined by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves based on previous analyses (413 pre-pandemic negatives, 99 PCR confirmed cases) (Appendix) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the 9,806 samples, 18 were positive for both Spike IgG (EuroImmun) and antibodies that block the RBD-hACE-2 interaction (sVNT), with the values highly correlated (Pearson r 0.7993, p &#x003C; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure</xref>). Further analysis of the 18 seropositive samples with a multiplex bead-based assay that detects antibody isotype reactivity to RBD, S and N proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) revealed a pattern consistent with infections that occurred weeks or months prior; a dominance of RBD and S protein IgG with few samples positive for N protein IgG, nor IgA or IgM against any of the three antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure</xref>). Within these 18 seropositive samples, six were retrospectively matched to donors with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. That all confirmed cases were detected supports the rationale of the testing algorithm applied. A further four seropositive samples were from donors with 2020 travel history in settings with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure (United Kingdom and Europe), suggesting likely infection outside New Zealand. The remaining eight seropositive samples were from seven different district health regions, giving a crude seroprevalence estimate of 0.082% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.035-0.16%). Applying the Rogan-Gladen estimate with the Lang-Reiczigel CI method to account for test sensitivity and specificity results in a true seroprevalence estimate of 0.103% (95% CI 0.09-0.12%) (Appendix) and an infection to case ratio of 2.3, based on notified cases on January 6<sup>th</sup>, 2021, suggesting some undiagnosed infections have occurred. However, this ratio needs to be interpreted with caution given the limitations of the sampling population, together with the extremely low number of seropositive donors, which also precludes any subgroup analysis.</p>

<p>The very low seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in New Zealand implies undetected community transmission has been limited. This seroprevalence is broadly similar to a recent study conducted in a low prevalence state of Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), and markedly lower than estimates of &#x003E;10% from serosurveys in Europe and America where the pandemic has been poorly controlled (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://serotracker.com">https://serotracker.com</ext-link>). This study provides the first robust, serological evidence of New Zealand&#x2019; s successful elimination strategy ahead of vaccine roll-out.</p>
