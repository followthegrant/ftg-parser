<title>Abstract</title>
<p>We estimate the impact of indoor face mask mandates and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) on COVID-19 case growth in Canada. Mask mandate introduction was staggered from mid-June to mid-August 2020 in the 34 public health regions in Ontario, Canada&#x2019;s largest province by population. Using this variation, we find that mask mandates are associated with a 22 percent weekly reduction in new COVID-19 cases, relative to the trend in absence of mandate. Province-level data provide corroborating evidence. We control for mobility behaviour using Google geo-location data and for lagged case totals and case growth as information variables. Our analysis of additional survey data shows that mask mandates led to an increase of about 27 percentage points in self-reported mask wearing in public. Counterfactual policy simulations suggest that adopting a nationwide mask mandate in June could have reduced the total number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases in Canada by over 50,000 over the period July&#x2013;November 2020. Jointly, our results indicate that mandating mask wearing in indoor public places can be a powerful policy tool to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p><sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When government policies to stem the spread of COVID-19 were introduced in early 2020, the best available supporting evidence came from research on previous epidemics, epidemiological modeling and case studies (OECD, 2020). Even when the efficacy of a given intervention in reducing viral transmission has been established, doubts regarding its usefulness may persist, because of uncertainty about adherence to the rules and other behavioural responses. For example, even though there is significant agreement in the medical literature that respiratory transmission of COVID-19 is the dominant vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Meyerowitz et al., 2020</xref>), and many clinical studies have shown that face masks reduce the spread of COVID-19 and similar diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chu et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Prather et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Leung et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Greenhalgh et al. 2020</xref>), a mask mandate may not be effective in practice if it fails to increase the prevalence of mask wearing (compliance) or if it leads to increased contacts because of a false sense of security. The low economic cost of mask mandates relative to other COVID-19 containment measures has generated keen interest worldwide for studying their effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref></sup> This interest has been compounded by the substantial variation in official advice regarding mask use, especially early in the pandemic, with national health authorities and the World Health Organization giving inconsistent or contradictory recommendations over time, ranging from &#x2018;not recommended&#x2019; to &#x2018;mandatory&#x2019;.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">2</xref></sup> <xref rid="figC1" ref-type="fig">Fig. C1</xref> in the Appendix plots self-reported mask usage in select countries (Canada, USA, Germany and Australia) and across Canadian provinces. The figure shows large differences in mask usage, both across countries and within Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3">3</xref></sup> An added challenge is to disentangle the impact of mask mandates from that of other policies, behavioural responses, or third factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mitze et al., 2020</xref>). Given the absence of large-scale randomized controlled trials on mask mandates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Howard et al., 2020</xref>), observational studies like ours are essential for informing health policy and public opinion, by formally analyzing the relationship between policy measures and the rate of propagation of COVID-19.</p>
<p>We estimate and quantify the impact of mask mandates and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), including regulations on businesses and gatherings, school closures, travel and self-isolation, and long-term care homes, on the growth of new COVID-19 cases in Canada. The Canadian data have the advantage of allowing two complementary approaches to address our objective. First, we estimate the effect of mandates by exploiting within-province variation in the timing of indoor face mask mandates in the 34 public health regions (Public Health Units<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4">4</xref></sup> or PHUs) in Ontario, Canada&#x2019;s most populous province with roughly 40% (15 mln) of the country&#x2019;s population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Statistics Canada, 2020</xref>). The advantage of this approach is that it uses variation over a relatively small geographic scale (PHU), holding all province-level policies and factors constant. The adoption of indoor face mask mandates in the 34 public health regions was staggered over approximately two months (June to August 2020), creating sufficient intertemporal variation.</p>
<p>Second, we evaluate the impact of NPIs in Canada as a whole, using the variation in the timing of mask mandates and other policies in the country&#x2019;s ten provinces. We construct time series for the intensity and timing of COVID-relevant policy measures from official public health orders and government announcements. By studying inter-provincial variation in the policy measures, we can analyze the impact of not only mask mandates, but also other NPIs, for which there is little or no variation across Ontario&#x2019;s PHUs. In addition, our data include the initial &#x2018;closing&#x2019; period (March&#x2013;April), the gradual &#x2018;re-opening&#x2019; period (May&#x2013;August), and the Fall period of new restrictions, providing variation from both the imposition and the relaxation of policies.</p>
<p>Our panel-data estimation strategy broadly follows the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov, Kasahara and Schrimpf (2021)</xref>, which we modify and adapt to the Canadian context. We account for observed behavioural changes and trends (using Google Community Mobility Reports geolocation data as proxy), as well as for lagged outcome responses to policy and behavioural changes. Our empirical approach also allows past epidemiological outcomes to impact current outcomes, either as information variables affecting unmeasured behaviour and policy, and/or directly, as in the SIR epidemiological model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kermack and McKendrick, 1927</xref>).</p>
<p>We find that, after two weeks from implementation, mask mandates are associated, on average, with a reduction of nearly 25 log points in the weekly case growth rate in Ontario, which can be interpreted as a 22% weekly reduction in new diagnosed COVID-19 cases relative to the trend in absence of mask mandate. We find corroborating evidence in the province-level analysis: a 20% weekly reduction in cases relative to the no-mandate trend in our baseline empirical specification. Furthermore, using additional survey data (Jones et al., 2021), we show that mask mandates increased self-reported mask usage in Canada by about 27 percentage points on average after implementation, confirming that the mandates had a significant impact on masking behaviour. Jointly, our results suggest that mandating mask wearing in indoor public places can be a powerful policy tool to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Counterfactual policy simulations using our empirical estimates further suggest that mandating indoor masks Canada-wide in mid-June could have reduced new COVID-19 cases in the country by more than 50,000 cases in total over the period July&#x2013;November 2020 relative to the actually observed numbers.</p>
<p>In addition, we find that the most stringent policy restrictions on businesses and gatherings observed in the provincial data are associated with a 44% weekly decrease of new cases, relative to the trend in absence of restrictions. The business/gathering estimates are, however, noisier than our estimates for mask mandates and do not retain statistical significance in all specifications. Travel and long-term care restrictions are associated with a sharp decrease in weekly case growth in the initial closing period (March&#x2013;April). These results suggest that relaxed restrictions and the associated increase in business and workplace activity and gatherings (including retail, restaurants and bars) can offset, in whole or in part, the estimated impact of mask mandates on COVID-19 case growth. We also find statistically significantly negative association between current case growth and information (log of past weekly cases), which is consistent with a behavioural feedback effect, e.g., people changing their contact rate based on observed case totals.</p>
<p>Our paper relates most closely to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lyu and Wehby (2020)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mitze et al. (2020)</xref>, which are recent studies on mask mandates using observational data, but adds to them in several ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5">5</xref></sup> First, we use regional variation within the same jurisdiction (similar to Mitze et al., but with a larger sample of treated regions that obviates the need for synthetic controls). This mitigates concerns about omitted variables, e.g., provincial or other factors. Second, we additionally use variation over a different geographic and administrative level, across provinces (similar to Chernozhukov et al. and Lyu and Wehby for U.S. states), and obtain very similar results as in our main analysis. Third, we estimate the increase in self-reported mask usage following mask mandates, which can help in understanding and predicting how the effect of mask mandates on COVID-19 spread may differ in other contexts. Our finding that mask mandates led to a significant increase in mask usage corroborates the large estimated mask mandate effect on COVID-19 case growth. Fourth, an important difference between our paper and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</xref>, possibly explaining our larger estimates for the effect of mask mandates, is that we evaluate <italic>universal</italic> mandatory indoor mask wearing for the public, instead of mandatory mask wearing for <italic>employees only</italic>. While other factors such as differences in mask-wear compliance between Canada and the U.S. may also contribute to the different estimates of the policy impact, our results suggest that broader in scope mask policies can be more effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the medical literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Meyerowitz et al. (2020)</xref>, a comprehensive review on COVID-19 transmission, conclude that there is strong evidence, from case and cluster reports, that respiratory transmission is dominant, with proximity and ventilation being the key determinants of transmission risk, as opposed to direct contact or fomite transmission. Numerous other studies, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Prather et al. (2020)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Howard et al. (2020)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Greenhalgh et al. (2020)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Leung et al. (2020)</xref>, among others, argue that face masks can reduce the spread of COVID-19. Our paper also complements recent work on COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions in various countries, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hsiang et al. (2020)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dergiades et al. (2020)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abouk and Heydari (2020)</xref> and in Canada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mohammed et al. (2020)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yuksel et al. (2020)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Armstrong et al. (2020)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Stevens et al. (2021)</xref>.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>We use three main data sources, respectively for epidemiological variables, NPIs and mask mandates, and behavioural responses. The analyzed time period is from the start of detected community transmission in Canada in March 2020 to the end of November 2020.</p>
<p>We located and accessed the original official data sources to compile a complete set of COVID-19 case, death, and test counts in all ten Canadian provinces over time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN7">7</xref></sup> In addition, we collected data on cases and weekly tests for each of the 34 public health units (PHUs) in Ontario. A detailed description is provided in the data files shared at the project&#x2019;s Github repository.</p>
<p>Implementation dates of NPIs and other public policies were collected from the official government websites, announcements, public health orders, and staged re-opening plans. In the national data, the raw policy measures data contain the dates or enactment and relaxation (if applicable) of 17 policy indicators including: mandatory mask wear; closure and re-opening of retail and non-essential businesses, restaurants, recreation facilities, and places of worship; school closures; limits on events and gatherings; international and domestic travel restrictions and self-isolation requirements; restrictions on visits and staff movement in long-term care homes. All policy indicators are defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblD1">Table D1</xref> in the Appendix.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN8">8</xref></sup> Since many of these indicators are highly correlated with each other, we combine them into five policy aggregates in the empirical analysis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB18">Table B18</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3b">Section 3.2</xref>). In the Ontario PHU data, the implementation dates of mask mandates and the intensity of restrictions for businesses and gatherings vary across PHUs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN9">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding behavioural responses, we use the Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, which summarize daily cellphone geo-location data by region as indices calculated relative to the median value for the same day of the week in the five-week baseline period January 3 to February 6, 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN10">10</xref></sup> In Ontario, these location data are available for each of the 51 first-level administrative divisions (counties, regional municipalities, single-tier municipalities and districts).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN11">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Empirical method</title>
<p>We follow the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</xref>, but modify and adapt it to the Canadian context. The empirical strategy uses the panel structure of the outcome, policy and behavioural proxy variables, and includes lags of outcomes, as information or following the causal paths suggested by the epidemiological SIR model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kermack and McKendrick, 1927</xref>). Specifically, we estimate the effect of policy interventions on COVID-19 outcomes while controlling for information and behaviour. In contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hsiang et al. (2020)</xref>, who study variation in NPIs across U.S. states or across countries, our identification strategy exploits policy variation at the sub-provincial level (Ontario&#x2019;s PHUs) in addition to cross-province variation, and our data captures both the closing down and re-opening stages of the epidemic.</p>

<p>To assess and disentangle the impact of mask mandates and other NPIs and behavioural responses on COVID-19 outcomes, we estimate:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="20201178v3_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>l</italic> denotes time lag in days, &#x0394; log(&#x0394;<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub>) is the weekly growth rate of tests (defined below), and <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;<italic>l</italic></sub> are confounders, including fixed effects. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation (1)</xref> models the relationship between COVID-19 outcomes, <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> and lagged policy measures, <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;<italic>l</italic></sub>, lagged behaviour, <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;<italic>l</italic></sub>, and information (lagged outcomes), <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;<italic>l</italic></sub>. For case growth as the outcome variable, we use a 14-day lag, <italic>l</italic> = 14. For deaths growth as the outcome, we use <italic>l</italic> = 28. The arguments for choosing these lags are discussed in detail in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Appendix E</xref>. Alternative lags are explored in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4d">Section 4.4</xref>.</p>
<p>Estimation <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation (1)</xref> is based on the structural model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</xref>, who propose the following causal mechanism and identification strategy. First, information <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;<italic>l</italic></sub> and confounders <italic>W</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;<italic>l</italic></sub> are determined at <italic>t</italic> &#x2212; <italic>l</italic>. Second, policies or NPIs, <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;<italic>l</italic></sub> are set, given the information and confounders. Third, behaviour <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;<italic>l</italic></sub> is realized, given the policies, information and confounders in place at that time. It is assumed that behaviour reacts to the information without a significant lag. Finally, the outcome <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> is realized (with lag <italic>l</italic>) given the policies, behaviour, information and confounders.</p>
<p>By including lagged outcomes, the proposed estimation approach allows for possible endogeneity of the policy interventions <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub>, that is, the introduction or relaxation of NPIs based on information about the level or the growth rate of cases or deaths. Also, past cases may be correlated with (lagged) government policies or behaviours that are not fully captured by the included policy and behaviour variables.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4c">Section 4.3</xref> and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB19">Table B19</xref>, we also estimate the relationship between policies <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub>, information, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> (weekly levels or growth of cases or deaths) and behaviour, <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub>.
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="20201178v3_eqn2.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
We find strong correlation between policy measures and the Google mobility behavioural proxy in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB19">Table B19</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation (1)</xref> separates the direct effect of policies on outcomes, with the appropriate lag, from the potential indirect effect on outcomes of changes in behaviour captured by the geolocation trends proxy, <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;<italic>l</italic></sub>. In Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB20">Table B20</xref>, we report estimates without including the behavioural proxy, that is, capturing the total effect of policies on outcomes. Since our estimates of the coefficient <italic>&#x03B1;</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation (1)</xref> are not significantly different from zero, the results without controlling for the behavioural variable <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;<italic>l</italic></sub> are very similar to those from estimating <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation (1)</xref>.</p>

<title>Outcomes</title>

<p>We assign numerical values to each of 17 policy indicators, listed and defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblD1">Table D1</xref>. The policy variables take values on the interval [0,1], with 0 meaning absence or lowest level of restrictions and 1 meaning most stringent restrictions. A policy value between 0 and 1 indicates partial restrictions, either in intensity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblD1">Table D1</xref> for details and definitions) or in geographical coverage (in large provinces). The policy values are assigned at the daily level for each region, while maintaining comparability across regions. Most non-mask policy indicators are available at the province level only.</p>
<p>Many NPIs were implemented at the same time, both relative to each other and across regions, especially during the March 2020 initial closing-down period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN15">15</xref></sup> This causes many of the policy indicators to be highly correlated with each other (see Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB4">Table B4</xref>). To avoid multi-collinearity problems, we therefore group, via arithmetic averaging, the 17 policy indicators into 5 policy aggregates: (i) <italic>Mask</italic>, which takes value 1 if an indoor mask mandate has been introduced, 0 if not, or value between 0 and 1 if only part of a province has enacted the policy; (ii) <italic>Business/gathering</italic>, which comprises regulations and restrictions on non-essential businesses and retail, personal businesses, restaurants, bars and nightclubs, places of worship, events, gyms and recreation, and limits on gathering; (iii) <italic>School</italic>, which is an indicator of provincial school closure (including Spring and Summer breaks); (iv) <italic>Travel</italic>, which includes international and domestic travel restrictions and self-isolation rules and (v) <italic>Long-term care (LTC)</italic>, which includes NPIs governing the operation of long-term care homes (visitor rules and whether staff are required to work on a single site).</p>
<p>The five policy aggregates are constructed at the daily level and capture both policy restrictions (an increase in the numerical value from 0 toward 1) and policy relaxations (decrease in the numerical value toward zero). In comparison, the policy indicators compiled by <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Raifman (2020)</xref> for the U.S. used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al.

Travel restrictions, school closures and business closures were initially implemented in a relatively short period in the middle of March 2020. There is variation in the <italic>Travel</italic> aggregate since some Canadian provinces (the Atlantic provinces) implemented strict inter-provincial domestic travel and self-isolation restrictions in addition to the federal regulations regarding international travel. Restrictions on long-term care facilities were introduced more gradually, with large variation across the provinces. In the period May-November 2020, there is more policy intensity variation, especially in the business and gatherings category, as the different provinces implemented their own &#x2018;re-opening&#x2019; plans and strategies. Mask mandates were introduced in Ontario starting from June in a few smaller PHUs and in early July in the most populous PHUs, Toronto, Ottawa and Peel (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblD2">Table D2</xref>). In Quebec, indoor masks were mandated province-wide on July 18 while other provinces such as British Columbia and Prince Edward Island did not introduce mask mandates until November (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblD3">Table D3</xref> for the complete list of dates).</p>

<p>There are two empirical challenges specific to the Canadian context and data. The first is the presence of small provinces or sub-regions with very few COVID-19 cases or deaths. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4d">Section 4.4</xref>, we perform robustness checks using different ways of handling the observations with very few cases (in particular zero cases). The second data limitation is that there are only 10 provinces in Canada and 34 public health units in Ontario, compared to 51 U.S. states in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</xref>. To account for the resulting small number of clusters in the estimation, we compute and report wild bootstrap standard errors and p-values, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cameron et al. (2008)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN17">17</xref></sup> On the other hand, our data has the advantage of a longer time horizon (March to November) and non-binary, more detailed policy variables compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Raifman et al.

<title>Behaviour proxy</title>
<p>We follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</xref> and other authors in interpreting the location change indices from the Google Community Mobility reports as proxies for changes in people&#x2019;s behaviour during the pandemic, keeping in mind that location is only one aspect of behaviour relevant to the spread of COVID-19. The general pattern in the data (see <xref rid="figC3" ref-type="fig">Fig. C3</xref>) shows sharply reduced frequency of recorded geo-locations in shops, workplaces and transit early in the pandemic (March), with a subsequent gradual increase back toward the baseline (except for transit), a flattening out in July and August, and a relatively small decline in the Fall months.</p>
<p>Several of the six available location indicators (retail, grocery and pharmacy, workplaces, transit, parks and residential) are highly correlated with each other (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB1">Tables B1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB2">B2</xref>) and/or contain many missing observations for the smaller PHUs and provinces. To address these data limitations and the possible impact of collinearity on the estimation results, we use as proxy for behavioural changes the arithmetic average of three mobility indicators: &#x201C;retail&#x201D;, &#x201C;grocery and pharmacy&#x201D; and &#x201C;workplaces&#x201D;.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN18">18</xref></sup> To be consistent with the weekly outcome variables and to mitigate day-of-the-week geo-location variation, we construct the Behaviour proxy <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> by taking a weekly moving average of the <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="20201178v3_inline2.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> (retail &#x002B; grocery and pharmacy &#x002B; workplaces) data, from date <italic>t</italic> &#x2212; 6 to date <italic>t</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN19">19</xref></sup> As a result, our empirical analysis uses weekly totals (for cases, tests and deaths) or weekly moving averages (for policies and the behaviour proxy) for all variables recorded on daily basis.</p>

<p>We first note that <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> does not exhibit a pre-trend &#x2013; the estimates are close to and statistically indistinguishable from zero before the PHU mask mandates are implemented. This helps address the potential concern that PHUs that implemented mask mandates at different times may have had a different trend in case growth. Second, we see a slight uptick at <italic>T</italic> = 0 (day 0 to 6), which may suggest that (some) mask mandates were implemented when case growth was high, a potential endogeneity concern. However, the <italic>T</italic> = 0 estimate is economically small and not statistically different from zero. Third, we confirm that the effect of mask mandates on case growth entails a time lag: we first observe a decrease in case growth at <italic>T</italic> = &#x002B;1 (day 7 to 13), while a larger and statistically significant decrease occurs at <italic>T</italic> = &#x002B;2 (day 14 to 20) justifying the 14-day lag used in our main specification (1). Fourth, the mask mandate effect appears persistent rather than transitory, since the reduction in case growth after <italic>T</italic> = &#x002B;2 does not revert to its level from before <italic>T</italic> = 0.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The estimates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> imply that, controlling for other policies, information, testing, and geo-location behaviour, mandatory indoor face masks are associated with a decrease of 24&#x2013;25 log points (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.02) in the weekly case growth rate, two weeks after implementation. This result can be interpreted as a 22% weekly reduction in new cases, relative to the trend without mask mandate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN24">24</xref></sup> The magnitude of the mask policy estimates is not very sensitive to whether lagged province-level data are included as additional information. We do not find a consistent statistically significant effect of the other NPIs in the Ontario sample.</p>
<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> indicate that indoor mask mandates have been a powerful preventive measure in the COVID-19 context. Our estimates of the mandates&#x2019; impact in Ontario&#x2019;s PHUs are larger than the 10 percentage point reduction in case growth estimated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</xref> for the U.S. A possible explanation is that Ontario&#x2019;s mask mandates are more comprehensive: we evaluate the effect of universal indoor mask-wearing for the public at large rather than the effect of mask-wearing for <italic>employees only</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</xref>. Differences in the compliance rate may also be a factor; we discuss this potential mechanism in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4c">Section 4.3</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> also shows a statistically significant negative association between information (log of past cases, log(&#x0394;C) 14), and current weekly case growth (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001 in all specifications). This indicates that a higher (lower) level of cases two weeks prior is associated with lower (higher) current case growth, which is consistent with a possible behavioural feedback. Therefore, while the location-based proxy <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> allows for certain behavioural responses, it may not capture other important aspects of behaviour (e.g., frequent hand-washing, physical distancing or the rate of social interactions) that can be influenced by the observed case counts. In fact, our coefficient estimate on the behaviour proxy <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> is not statistically significantly different from zero (both in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and in the province-level <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> below), unlike in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</xref>. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB19">Table B19</xref>, we find strong contemporaneous correlations between policy measures, log cases, and the Google mobility behavioural proxy from estimating <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">equation (2)</xref>. This suggests that the information (lagged cases) and the lagged policy variables in (1) may absorb lagged behavioural responses proxied by <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;<italic>l</italic></sub> or other latent behavioural changes not captured by <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;<italic>l</italic></sub>. Finally, as expected, the weekly growth rate of COVID cases is positively correlated with the weekly tests growth rate.</p>

<title>Province-level results</title>
<p>We next evaluate the impact of NPIs on COVID-19 case growth in Canada as a whole, by using variation in the timing of policy interventions across the 10 provinces. We also examine NPIs for which there is no data variation across Ontario&#x2019;s PHUs (e.g., travel or long-term care regulations), in addition to mask mandates.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> displays the estimates of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation (1)</xref> for weekly case growth, along with wild bootstrap p-values, clustered at the province level (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB10">Table B10</xref> for other methods of computing the standard errors). Column (1) uses lagged cases and lagged case growth at the province level as information while column (2) additionally includes lagged cases and case growth at the national level. Both specifications include province and week fixed effects (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB5">Table B5</xref> for different time controls).</p>
<p>The most robust result in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> is the estimate on mask mandates (Mask 14). We find that mask mandates are associated with a significant reduction in weekly case growth of 22 log points (p-values &#x003C; 0.03), which corresponds to a 20% weekly reduction in new cases, relative to the trend in absence of mandate. It is reassuring that these province-level results are very close in magnitude and consistent with our results using Ontario PHU data.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> further suggests that restrictions on businesses and gatherings are associated with a reduction in weekly case growth of 58&#x2013;59 log points or, vice versa, that relaxing business/gathering restrictions is associated with higher case growth. These estimates correspond to a 44&#x2013;45% weekly decrease in new cases, relative to the trend in absence of mandate. We obtain similar results in robustness <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB5">Tables B5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB12">B12</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB16">B16</xref>. Note, however, that the business/gathering estimates are noisier than our estimates for mask mandates (p-values &#x003C; 0.08) and lose statistical significance in some robustness checks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB9">Table B9</xref>). Still, these results suggest that relaxed restrictions and the associated increase in business and work-place activity or gatherings (including restaurants, bars and retail) may be an important offsetting factor for the estimated impact of mask mandates on COVID-19 case growth.</p>
<p>As in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, we again find that weekly case growth is negatively associated with weekly cases two weeks prior (log(&#x0394;C) 14 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) and positively associated with the weekly tests growth, &#x0394; log(&#x0394;<italic>T</italic>) (p-value &#x003C; 0.001).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN25">25</xref></sup></p>

The figure shows that the estimated mask mandate effect slowly diminishes over time, from &#x2212;0.35 until Sep. 15 to &#x2212;0.17 until Dec. 31. A possible explanation is the steady increase in self-reported mask usage in the provinces without mandates over this period (see <xref rid="figC2" ref-type="fig">Fig. C2</xref>), which is also consistent with the declining estimate of the effect of mask mandates on mask usage over time shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4c">Section 4.3</xref>.</p>

<title>Mask usage</title>
<p>The effectiveness of any public policy critically depends on whether and how it affects people&#x2019;s behaviour. In this section, we use self-reported survey data on mask usage to examine whether mask mandates increased mask use in Canada (&#x201C;first-stage&#x201D; analysis).</p>
<p>We use data from the YouGov COVID-19 Public Monitor (Jones et al. 2021), which consists of multiple waves of public opinion surveys fielded regularly since early April 2020 in many countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN26">26</xref></sup> Here, we focus on inter-provincial comparisons within Canada. Our main variable of interest is the response to the question &#x201C;Thinking about the last 7 days, how often have you worn a face mask outside your home (e.g. when on public transport, going to a supermarket, going to a main road)?&#x201D; The possible answers are &#x201C;Always&#x201D;, &#x201C;Frequently&#x201D;, &#x201C;Sometimes&#x201D;, &#x201C;Rarely&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Not at all&#x201D;. We create a binary variable taking value 1 if the response is &#x201C;Always&#x201D; and 0 otherwise, and another variable taking value of 1 if the respondent answered either &#x201C;Always&#x201D; or &#x201C;Frequently&#x201D; and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>We begin with an illustration of self-reported mask usage in Canada from April to November 2020. <xref rid="figC2" ref-type="fig">Fig. C2</xref> plots the average self-reported mask usage (response &#x201C;Always&#x201D;) in the provinces with and without mask mandates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN27">27</xref></sup> The figure shows that self-reported mask usage is higher, by up to 50 percentage points in early August, in the provinces with a mask mandate compared to the provinces without a mandate. Since <xref rid="figC2" ref-type="fig">Fig. C2</xref> does not account for compositional changes in the data and other factors, we formally estimate <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">equation (2)</xref>, using self-reported mask usage as the behavioural outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN28">28</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> displays the results from an event study analysis of mask mandates and the change in mask usage, ranging from 6 weeks before the mask mandate to 5 weeks after the mask mandate (<italic>T</italic> = &#x2013;6 to &#x002B;5, where <italic>T</italic> = 0 is the implementation date of the mask mandate). The reference point is one week before the implementation of the mask mandate (<italic>T</italic> = &#x2013;1). The left and right panels of <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> present results for the &#x201C;Always&#x201D; and &#x201C;Always&#x201D; or &#x201C;Frequently&#x201D; mask usage responses, respectively.</p>
<p>We make several observations. First, neither panel shows a pre-trend &#x2013; the estimates are statistically indistinguishable from zero before the mask mandates are implemented. This addresses the potential concern that provinces that implemented mask mandates may have had a different trend in mask usage than provinces that did not. Second, the effect of mask mandates on mask usage is immediate: an increase of roughly 11 percentage points on average, as soon as the mask policy is implemented (<italic>T</italic> = 0). Third, the effect appears persistent rather than transitory, since mask usage does not revert to its level before <italic>T</italic> = 0.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> displays the estimates on self-reported mask usage in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">equation (2)</xref> along with wild bootstrap p-values clustered at the province level. As in Tables 1 and 2, our baseline specification uses week fixed effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN29">29</xref></sup> The results show that mask mandates are associated with 27 percentage point increase in self-reported mask usage, for the response &#x201C;Always&#x201D; (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001), from a base of self-reported mask usage without mask mandate of 33.2%. Similarly, &#x201C;Always&#x201D; or &#x201C;Frequent&#x201D; mask usage increases by 16 percentage points.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN31">31</xref></sup></p>

<caption><p>Canada &#x2013; Self-reported mask usage</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="20201178v3_tbl3.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>These results show that mask mandates exhibit broad compliance in Canada and establish a possible mechanism for the significant impact of the mandates on the spread of COVID-19 that we find. That said, given that mask mandates do not change everyone&#x2019;s behaviour, our estimates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> represent intent-to-treat effects. The full effect of the entire population shifting from not wearing to wearing masks is likely larger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN32">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>There has been a heated debate on whether mask wearing may create a false sense of security and reduce adherence to other preventive measures. We investigate this question using the YouGov survey data. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB14">Tables B14</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB15">B15</xref> in the Appendix indicate, we find no evidence that mask mandates in Canada had an offsetting effect on other preventive measures such as hand washing, using sanitizer, avoiding gatherings, and avoiding touching objects in public during the period we study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN33">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, we plot the estimates for the mask mandate variable from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> for different dates. The estimates slightly decrease over time, which is consistent with the slowly diminishing effect of the mask mandates on case growth in Canada shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>.</p>

<title>Robustness</title>
<sec id="s4d1">
<title>Zero weekly cases</title>
<p>A possible concern may be that the dependent variable <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> = &#x0394; log(&#x0394;<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub>) is not well defined when the weekly case totals &#x0394;<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> or &#x0394;<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>it</italic>&#x2212;7</sub> equal zero. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</xref>, we replace log(0) with &#x2212;1 in our baseline specification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN34">34</xref></sup> We check the robustness of our estimates to alternative treatments of zero weekly cases in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB6">Appendix Tables B6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB9">B9</xref> &#x2013; replacing log(0) with 0, adding 1 to &#x0394;<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> before taking logs, or population-weighted least squares. Our main results on mask mandates in Ontario PHUs and Canadian provinces are robust to these alternative specifications, with the single exception of columns (7) and (8) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB6">Table B6</xref> where the mask mandate estimate loses statistical significance at the 10% level due to reduced power.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d2">
<title>Policy collinearity</title>
<p>A possible concern is that some NPIs (e.g., international travel restrictions or school closures) were implemented within a very short time interval. Thus, we may lack sufficient regional variation to distinguish and identify the separate effect of each policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN35">35</xref></sup> Collinearity in the policy aggregates could also affect the standard errors and the signs of the estimated coefficients. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB8">Table B8</xref> for Ontario and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB11">Table B11</xref> for Canada in the Appendix report the estimates from our baseline specification when omitting one policy at a time or when including the mask mandate policy only. Our mask mandate estimates remain largely robust, with the exception of the last columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB11">Table B11</xref> where the estimates&#x2019; statistical significance is affected. This confirms the importance of controlling for all NPIs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d3">
<title>Alternative initial dates</title>
<p><xref rid="figC4" ref-type="fig">Fig. C4</xref> and <xref rid="figC5" ref-type="fig">C5</xref> show that our estimates and confidence intervals for the effect of mask mandates on case growth in Ontario and Canada do not vary much with the initial date of the respective samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d4">
<title>Alternative lags</title>
<p>We also check alternative time lags, of either shorter or longer duration, centered around the baseline value of 14 days. <xref rid="figC6" ref-type="fig">Fig. C6</xref> for Ontario and <xref rid="figC7" ref-type="fig">Fig. C7</xref> for Canada plot the estimates and 95% confidence intervals. The mask mandate estimates for Canada remain fairly consistent for the different plausible lag values while the Ontario sample estimates are a bit more sensitive to the lag length, with our baseline estimates being in the middle in terms of magnitude.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d5">
<title>Omitted variables</title>
<p>The Google mobility behaviour proxy variable likely misses some aspects of people&#x2019;s behaviour that could be relevant for COVID-19 transmission. One such factor could be weather. For example, good weather may cause more people to spend time outside and lower the chance of viral transmission. Columns (3) and (4) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB12">Table B12</xref> report estimates for Canada including lagged weather variables (daily maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation for the largest city in each province<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN36">36</xref></sup>) as additional controls. The estimates on mask mandates remain statistically significantly negative (p-value &#x003C; 0.03) but are slightly reduced compared to the baseline values in columns (1)&#x2013;(2). While we find no effect of weather on case growth, we note that any possible effect of seasonal change would be absorbed by the week fixed effects, and any possible effect of day-to-day weather may be obscured by the stochastic lag between transmission and detection.</p>
<p>Another possible concern is that the information variables (lagged cases and lagged case growth) may not fully capture the actual information based on which people react or adjust their behaviour, possibly affecting the observed case growth. Columns (5) and (6) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB12">Table B12</xref> add a national-level &#x201C;News&#x201D; variable to our baseline specification, defined as the number of daily search results for &#x201C;coronavirus&#x201D; or &#x201C;COVID-19&#x201D; from the <italic>ProQuest Canadian Newsstream</italic> news aggregator service (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4">Appendix D</xref> for more details). In column (6), the news variable is statistically significant at the 10% level. Our estimates on mask mandates and business/gathering remain very close to those in the baseline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d6">
<title>Heterogeneous treatment effects</title>
<p>We address the possibility of heterogeneous treatment effects in two ways. First, several recent papers point out that the two-way fixed effects estimator (week and PHU/province fixed effects in our case) is a weighted average of treatment effects, where some of the weights can be negative if the treatment effect is not constant across groups and over time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN37">37</xref></sup> In particular, de Chaisemartin and D&#x2019;Haultfoeuille (2018) develop an estimator that is valid under these conditions. We apply their estimator to our main analysis, regarding case growth in Ontario.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN38">38</xref></sup> We obtain a mask mandate estimate of &#x2212;0.236 (s.e. 0.415), which is very close in magnitude to our two-way fixed effect estimates (&#x2212;0.244 and &#x2212;0.248) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN39">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, we also compute and compare mask the mandate estimates for &#x2018;early&#x2019; vs. &#x2018;late&#x2019; PHU adopters in Ontario. Specifically, we define as &#x2018;early&#x2019; adopters the PHUs that implemented mask mandates before July 15 (nearly half of the PHUs adopted mask mandates by then), and &#x2018;late&#x2019; adopters as the PHUs that implemented mandates after July 15. We obtain similar estimates for the early and late adopters (&#x2212;0.266 and &#x2212;0.255).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN40">40</xref></sup> Jointly, these results suggest that the effects of mask mandates on case growth are unlikely to be heterogeneous across regions and time in a way that affects our estimates, which is also consistent with the estimates&#x2019; stability over different dates on <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>.</p>

<title>Counterfactuals</title>
<p>We use our estimates from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> to evaluate several counterfactuals in which the actual mask policy is replaced by an alternative hypothetical policy. Letting <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> be the implementation date of a counterfactual policy, we set the counterfactual weekly case count, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="20201178v3_inline5.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, equal to &#x0394;<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> for all <italic>t</italic> &#x003C; <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>. For each date <italic>t</italic> &#x2265; <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>, using the definition of <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> in (3), we compute <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="20201178v3_inline6.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and the counterfactual weekly case growth rate, <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="20201178v3_inline7.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, as follows:
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="20201178v3_ueqn2.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>&#x0176;</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> is the regression-fitted value of weekly case growth; <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub><italic>Mask</italic> 14</sub> is the coefficient estimate (&#x2212;0.248 or &#x2212;0.223) on the mask mandate variable Mask 14 in baseline specification, column (2) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> or 2, depending on the counterfactual; Mask<sup><italic>c</italic></sup> 14 is the counterfactual policy (e.g., different implementation date, wider geographic coverage or absence of mask mandate); and <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub>log(&#x0394;<italic>C</italic>)_14</sub> is the coefficient estimate (&#x2212;0.168 or &#x2212;0.172) on lagged cases log(&#x0394;<italic>C</italic>) 14 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> or 2, column (2). The coefficient <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub>log(&#x0394;<italic>C</italic>)_14</sub> adjusts the counterfactual case growth rate for the negative statistically significant association between the weekly case total two weeks prior and time-<italic>t</italic> case growth. This feedback effect may be due to people being more careful when they perceive the risk of infection to be higher.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> show results from two counterfactual policy evaluations. The first counterfactual, depicted in the left panels, assumes that masks are adopted everywhere at the earliest date observed in the data (June 12, 2020). <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> shows that if mask mandates were implemented in all Ontario PHUs at the earliest observed date, this could have led to an average reduction of 770 cases per week over the simulation period Jun. 26 to Nov. 30, holding all else equal. The estimated reduction is in the range 70 to 500 cases per week early on, in July&#x2013;August, peaks at about 2,200 cases per week in mid-October, and decreases to under 1,000 cases per week by the end of November. For Canada as a whole, a country-wide adoption of mask mandates in June is estimated to reduce new weekly COVID-19 cases by 22% on average over the simulation period, which amounts to a total reduction of over 50,000 cases. The estimated average weekly reduction is by about 680 cases for July&#x2013;August and peaks at 9,600 cases per week in November. In both simulations, the feedback effect via <italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub>log(&#x0394;<italic>C</italic>)_14</sub> (lagged cases as information) starts moderating the decrease in cases two weeks after the initial impact of the counterfactual policy.</p>

Our estimates imply that such counterfactual absence of mask mandates, holding all else equal, would have led to a large and growing over time increase in new cases, both in Ontario (estimated 5,400 additional weekly cases at the end of September and 33,000 additional cases per week as of Nov. 30) and Canada-wide (estimated 10,700 additional weekly cases at the end of September and over 100,000 additional cases per week as of Nov. 30).</p>
<p>In <xref rid="figC10" ref-type="fig">Fig. C10</xref> in the Appendix, we also simulate a counterfactual in which British Columbia (BC) and Alberta, the third and fourth largest Canadian provinces by population, adopt province-wide mask mandates on June 12. The results indicate an average reduction of about 1,000 cases per week for BC and 550 cases for Alberta over the simulation period. The estimated effect is smaller for Alberta, despite its larger case totals, since Alberta adopted mask mandates in its main cities on Aug. 1 while BC had no mask mandate until November.</p>
<p>The counterfactual simulations discussed above assume that behaviour, policies and all other variables (except mask policy and <italic>t</italic>&#x2212;14 case counts) remain fixed at their values observed in the data. This is a strong assumption which may be more plausible over a relatively short period (e.g., focusing on July/August). In addition, all counterfactuals assume that regions without a mask mandate by a given date would react to a mandate in similar way, on average, as the regions that have already imposed a mandate. Therefore, these simulation results should be interpreted with caution and only as a rough illustration of the estimated impact of mask mandates on COVID-19 cases.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We estimate the impact of indoor face mask mandates and other public policy measures on the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. We use both within-province variation from Ontario and cross-province variation in the timing of mandates. We find robust and consistent significantly negative association between mask mandates and subsequent COVID-19 case growth &#x2013; a 20 to 22% average weekly reduction in new cases. These results are supported by our analysis of survey data, which shows that the mandates led to a significant increase of 27 percentage points in the proportion of people reporting always wearing a mask in public. We show that the impact of mask mandates on COVID-19 case growth persists as long as they are necessary to achieve near universal mask wearing in indoor public spaces.</p>
<p>The earlier mask mandates in Canada were introduced in Summer 2020 when other policy measures were relaxed, as part of the economy&#x2019;s re-opening. We find that reduced restrictions on businesses or gatherings are associated with subsequent COVID-19 case growth &#x2013; a factor that can offset and obscure the public health benefits of mask mandates. Past case totals were also found to matter for subsequent COVID-19 outcomes, suggesting that riskier behaviour may follow prior information perceived as favourable. This feedback mechanism may limit how low the number of new cases can be pushed by mask mandates or other restrictions short of a lockdown. On the other hand, we find no evidence that mask mandates reduce adherence to other precautions against COVID-19. Indeed, they could potentially serve as an important behavioural anchor, especially in periods of plateauing or declining transmission.</p>
<p>Importantly, the effect of mask mandates that we estimate is <italic>relative</italic> to the absence of mandates and not absolute. In unfavourable conditions, such as during seasons when people gather indoors (fall, winter and early spring in most of Canada) and before widespread vaccination, a mask mandate appears insufficient to prevent an increase in new infections on its own and should be considered in conjunction with other policy measures.</p>
<p>We conclude that mandating mask wearing in indoor public spaces is a powerful policy tool to limit COVID-19 transmission, especially given its relatively low cost to the economy. As long as it remains doubtful that a sufficient fraction of the population has been immunized to achieve herd immunity &#x2013; a concern particularly relevant in the face of more contagious COVID-19 variants and before vaccines are administered to children &#x2013; it appears prudent to keep mask mandates in place even while lifting other restrictions.</p>
<p>We have deliberately refrained from studying direct economic impacts of COVID-19, focusing instead on unique features of the Canadian data for identifying the effect of mask mandates and other NPIs on COVID-19 case growth. Future research, jointly considering the epidemiological impact and the economic benefits and costs of the various public policies and restrictions, would enrich the ongoing debate and provide further guidance.</p>

<title>Additional Analysis</title>
<sec id="s6">
<title>Closing period</title>
<p>We investigate whether the NPIs&#x2019; impact differed in the initial closing-down period of imposition of policy measures by restricting the sample to the period March 11 to May 14. The end date (referring to the NPIs in place on April 30) was chosen because very few NPIs were relaxed in Canada before early May (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB16">Table B16</xref> suggest that the imposition of closures, long-term care restrictions, and travel restrictions early in the pandemic was associated with a sharp subsequent reduction in weekly case growth, as also seen on <xref rid="figC8" ref-type="fig">Fig. C8</xref> &#x2013; the average log weekly growth rate of cases &#x0394; log(&#x0394;C) fell from 2.4 (ten-fold growth in weekly cases) to &#x2212;0.4 (33% decrease in weekly cases) between March 15 and April 5. We interpret these results with caution, however, since many policy measures and restrictions were enacted in a short time interval during March 2020 and there is not much inter-provincial variation (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). No mask mandates were present in Canada in this period. We did not find any additional policy impacts in the mid-May to November period (not reported in the Table).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7">
<title>Deaths</title>
<p>We also examine the weekly deaths growth rate as an outcome variable. Because COVID-19 deaths in Canada are highly concentrated in long-term care homes, mask mandates and NPIs may have a different effect on deaths growth than on cases. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB17">Table B17</xref> reports estimates of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">equation (1)</xref> using the weekly deaths growth rate <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> = &#x0394; log(&#x0394;<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub>) as the dependent variable, for each province <italic>i</italic> and date <italic>t</italic> in the sample period, where &#x0394;<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> are weekly deaths from date <italic>t</italic>&#x2212;6 to date <italic>t</italic>. We use a 28-day lag for the policy, behaviour, and information variables, to reflect the fact that deaths occur on average about two weeks after case detection (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app5">Appendix E</xref> for detailed justification). The estimate coefficients on Mask 28 are not statistically significantly different from zero in our baseline specifications. However, considering the large standard errors, they are not inconsistent in magnitude with our estimates for mask mandates and case growth in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. In addition, when weighing the data by provincial population in columns (7) and (8), which de-emphasizes the small provinces with very few deaths, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB17">Table B17</xref> suggest that mask mandates are associated with a 39 log points reduction in the weekly death rate (32% weekly reduction in deaths relative to the trend in absence of mandate). We supplement <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblB17">Table B17</xref> with <xref rid="figC11" ref-type="fig">Fig. C11</xref>, where we display the estimated coefficients, with 95% confidence intervals, on the main variable of interest Mask 28 for different sample end dates between August 31 and November 30, 2020.</p>

<label>Appendix E.</label>
<title>Lags Determination</title>
<p>As discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3a">Section 3.1</xref>, we assume a lag of 14 days between a change in policy or behaviour and its hypothesized effect on weekly case growth, and lag of 28 days between such a change and its effect on weekly death growth.</p>
<p>First, we consider the lag between infection and a case being reported. As most identified cases of COVID-19 in Canada are symptomatic, we focus on symptomatic individuals. For most provinces cases are listed according to the date of report to public health. In provinces where the dates instead refer to the public announcement, we shifted them back by one day, as announcements typically contain the cases reported to public health on the previous day. The relevant lag therefore has two components:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Incubation period: most studies suggest an average incubation period of 5-6 days (e.g. 5.2 days in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al. (2020)</xref>, 5.5 days in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lauer et al. (2020)</xref>, 5.6 days in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Linton et al. (2020)</xref>, 6.4 days in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Backer et al. (2020)</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Time between symptoms onset and reporting the case to public health: the Ontario data contain an estimate of the symptom onset date (&#x201C;episode date&#x201D;) for each case. For our sample period, the average difference between the date of report and the episode date is 4.7 days, including only values from 1 to 28 days. We assume that the lags in Ontario and in other provinces are similar, and use a value of 5 days between symptom onset and report to public health authorities.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Altogether, this implies that the average lag between infection and the reporting of a positive case to public health is approximately 10&#x2013;11 days. Since awareness of a policy is often partial on its first day in effect, we use a lag of 11 days. Second, we consider the effect of weekly averaging on the appropriate lag for our analysis. Suppose a policy or behavioural change starts on date <italic>t</italic>, impacting the daily growth in infections between dates <italic>t</italic> &#x2212; 1 and <italic>t</italic> and in each subsequent day. Then, assuming a lag of 11 days between infection and case reporting, case counts <italic>C</italic> are affected from date <italic>t</italic> &#x002B; 11 onward. Our outcome variable &#x0394; log(&#x0394;C) thus would react to the original policy or behavioural change on date <italic>t</italic> &#x002B; 11. The change is complete on <italic>t</italic> &#x002B; 23, when the week from <italic>t</italic> &#x002B; 17 to <italic>t</italic> &#x002B; 23 is compared to the week from <italic>t</italic> &#x002B; 10 to <italic>t</italic> &#x002B; 16. The midpoint of the change is <italic>t</italic> &#x002B; 17. Choosing a lag of <italic>l</italic> days implies that the policy/behaviour variable phases in from <italic>t</italic> &#x002B; <italic>l</italic> to <italic>t</italic> &#x002B; <italic>l</italic> &#x002B; 6.</p>
<p>To match the midpoint of this phase-in to the midpoint of the change in the outcome variable, we set <italic>l</italic> = 14. The chosen lag also matches the lag used by other authors who study COVID-19 policy interventions, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chernozhukov et al. (2021)</xref>. We explore the sensitivity of our results to different lag lengths in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4d">Section 4.4</xref>.</p>
<p>Regarding deaths, our data are, in most cases, backdated (revised by the authorities expost) to the actual date of death. The medical literature suggests that the mean time from symptom onset to death is around 19 days (20 days in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>.8 days in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Verity et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>.2 days when accounting for right truncation in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Linton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>.1 days in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sanche et al., 2020</xref>), that is, two weeks longer than our estimate of the time from symptom onset to reporting of a positive test result. We accordingly set the lag used in our analysis of the death growth rate in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix A</xref> to 28 days.</p>

<p>Policies and cases in a region may also impact case growth in neighbouring regions. Because of data limitations, we are unable to directly address this concern in the current paper. However, we note that this issue should tend to attenuate the estimated effect of policies if a fraction of cases are unaffected by policy changes in the jurisdiction where they are counted because of infections occurring elsewhere. Moreover, measurement error may be introduced if policy changes elsewhere affect a jurisdiction&#x2019;s cases. Both these effects would work against finding statistically significant results.</p>

<p>The correlation between weekly tests &#x0394;<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> and the presence of a mask mandate is low in Ontario and moderately positive across provinces (see Tables B3 and B4); it is present because of the coincident expansion of mask mandates across regions and gradually increasing testing rates over time. To the extent that unobserved changes in testing strategy may affect our estimates, we believe that they would work against our findings of NPI effects, as restrictions may coincide with increased testing. However, any such effect is likely minor: one-time changes in testing only temporarily affect the growth rate of detected new cases. Moreover, for our main Ontario analysis, provincial guidelines limit PHUs&#x2019; discretion in testing effort.</p>
