<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Quantifying antibody reactivity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens at the population level may help understand individual differences in COVID-19 severity. Pre-existing low antibody cross-reactivity may be particularly prevalent among childcare providers, including pediatric health care workers (HCW) who may be more exposed to circulating coronaviruses.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Cross-sectional study that included adults in the Vancouver area in British Columbia (BC), Canada, between May 17 and June 19, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was ascertained by measuring total SARS-CoV-2 IgG/M/A antibodies against a recombinant spike (S1) protein and adjusted for bias due to false-positive and false-negative test results. A novel, high sensitivity multiplex assay was also used to profile IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, SARS-CoV and four circulating coronaviruses.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Among 276 participants (71&#x0025; HCW), three showed evidence of direct viral exposure, yielding an adjusted seroprevalence of 0.60&#x0025; [95&#x0025;CI 0&#x0025; &#x2013; 2.71&#x0025;], with no difference between HCW and non-HCW, or between paediatric and adult HCW. Among the 273 unexposed individuals, 7.3&#x0025; [95&#x0025;CI 4.5&#x0025; &#x2013; 11.1&#x0025;], 48.7 [95&#x0025;CI 42.7&#x0025; &#x2013; 54.8&#x0025;] and 82.4&#x0025; [95&#x0025;CI 77.4&#x0025; &#x2013; 86.7&#x0025;] showed antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 RBD, N or Spike proteins, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 reactivity did not significantly correlate with age, sex, did not significantly differ between HCW and non-HCW (prevalence 1.0&#x0025; vs 1.0&#x0025;; <italic>P</italic>=1.00) and between pediatric and adult HCW (0.7&#x0025; vs 1.6&#x0025;; <italic>P</italic>=0.54), and modestly correlated with reactivity to circulating coronaviruses (Spearman rho range: 0.130 to 0.224 for 7 significant (FDR 5&#x0025;), out of 16 correlations, from 36 correlations tested).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>A substantial proportion of individuals showed low, but detectable antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens in this population despite a low evidence of direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic on March 11<sup>th</sup>, 2020 and has resulted in more than 32.3 million cases and 984,000 deaths worldwide as of September 25, 2020. Although this virus has caused unacceptably high mortality, a majority of cases are asymptomatic (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Seroconversion occurs within 2-3 weeks in &#x003E;99&#x0025; of individuals with COVID-19, with the spike and nucleocapsid proteins eliciting strongest antibody responses (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, up to 40&#x0025; of SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals showed T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, suggesting a high degree of cross-reactivity from a previous exposure to unidentified heterologous antigens (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
<p>Four seasonal coronaviruses pre-dated COVID-19 and are known to cause up to 30&#x0025; of upper respiratory tract infections (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Of these endemic coronaviruses, the beta-coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 are more structurally similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 40&#x0025; sequence similarity between their main surface antigen (the spike protein) and that of SARS-CoV-2, whereas the alpha-coronaviruses, NL63 and 229E, are less structurally related (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Since the SARS-CoV and the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemics, interest in the natural history and antibody levels of circulating coronaviruses across seasons has increased (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The potential for pre-existing antibody reactivity against SARS-Cov-2 due to circulating coronaviruses has been debated (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A main caveat of previous studies is that the assays used may not have been sensitive enough to detect the low SARS-CoV-2 antigen cross-reactivity in unexposed individuals (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>
<p>Across the world, estimates for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence range from 0.26&#x0025; to 24.4&#x0025;, with some reports suggesting higher rates in health care workers (HCW) (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Vancouver, British Columbia (BC), is the third largest metropolitan area in Canada, with a population of 2.5 million people. The province of BC (population 5.017 million) reported its first COVID-19 case on January 25. In BC, the epidemiological peak of the pandemic occurred between the third week of March and late April, with the vast majority of cases occurring in the greater Vancouver area (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This westernmost Canadian province has done comparatively well in controlling the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 within its territory (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Indeed, a study from the BC Centre for Disease Control (BC CDC) estimated that only 0.55&#x0025; of individuals in Vancouver had been directly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 after the first wave. Thus, with its low number of reported COVID-19 cases, and considering that immunity to circulating coronaviruses is only short-lived and seasonal (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), BC, represents an interesting setting to compare antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 arising from a direct exposure to COVID-19 versus the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity in unexposed individuals, within the same population and across the same time period.</p>
<p>The main objective of this study was to determine the population-level seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2, and antibody reactivity against SARS and circulating coronaviruses in unexposed individuals within the greater Vancouver area. Understanding that pre-existing reactivity to circulating coronaviruses could be more prevalent among paediatric HCW (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), a secondary objective of this study was to compare the SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity profiles between adult, paediatric HCW and non-HCW.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>Prospective cross-sectional seroprevalence study after the first pandemic wave in BC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Adults over 18 years of age from the greater Vancouver metropolitan area were included if they did not have <italic>active</italic> COVID-19, did not require self-isolation as per BC provincial public measures or had recovered from COVID-19 at least 14 days prior to the study visit and blood sample collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Recruitment</title>
<p>At the time this study was initiated, the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Canada was not known and there were little data around the world. To gain more insight, an invitation email was sent about this study to the following departments at BC Children&#x2019;s Hospital and BC Women&#x2019;s Hospital (together, C&#x0026;W, the largest pediatric referral hospital centre in BC): pediatric intensive care; pediatric emergency; family medicine; obstetrics and gynecology; pediatric anesthesiology; and pediatric otolaryngology. The affiliated research institute, the BC Children&#x2019;s Hospital Research Institute (BCCHRI), was also contacted email. The email was also sent to hospitalists and the anesthesiology and critical care departments at Surrey Memorial Hospital (SMH), the most active hospital site for pandemic COVID-19 cases in BC. To minimize recruitment bias, all adults who responded to the email and returned their signed consent form were enrolled sequentially and were invited to give a blood sample, without triaging. Blood samples were collected at BCCHRI and SMH between May 17 and June 19, 2020 (2,794 COVID-19 cases had been reported in BC by the end of this enrollment period). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the University of British Columbia Children&#x2019;s &#x0026; Women&#x2019;s Research Ethic Board (H20-01205).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Study size</title>
<p>Since there was very little SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence data available at the time and none in BC or even Canada, no <italic>a priori</italic> sample size calculation was performed. The recruitment period was therefore defined by convenience over a three-week period of enrolment, in order to obtain baseline data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Blood sampling</title>
<p>Blood was drawn in gold-top serum separator tube with polymer gel (BD, cat# 367989); after at least 30 minutes of clotting at room temperature, the blood sample was then centrifuged at 1,400 G to obtain serum aliquots that were frozen at &#x2212;80 &#x00B0;C within four hours of collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Multiplex antibody assay</title>
<p>A highly sensitive 10-plex assay (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Gaithersburg, USA) where each antigen is &#x2018;spotted&#x2019; into a single well of a 96-well plate (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) was used to measure antibodies against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens &#x2013; S-2P native spike protein (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD) and nucleocapsid (N) protein; the SARS-CoV spike protein; and spike proteins from circulating beta-(HKU1, OC43) and alpha-(229E and NL63) coronaviruses. Briefly, after blocking wells with 5&#x0025; BSA, sera were added at 4 dilutions (1:100, 1:800, 1:25 and 1:10,000) and incubated with shaking for two hours. Sulfo-tag-labelled anti-IgG detection antibody was added to the wells and the electrochemiluminescence signal was read using the MSD Sector 600 instrument. Results are dilution-corrected interpolated values from a standard curve with assigned Arbitrary Units (AU)/mL. Assignment of AU/mL of serum was performed by Meso Scale Diagnostics and is designed such that values are comparable to an International Standard Serum (ISS), and such that in the future, bridging to a WHO International Standard will be possible. In absence of a definable threshold for positive antibody reactivity for SARS-CoV-2 antigens in unexposed individuals, we used the positive/ negative thresholds derived from the ROC using likelihood ratios&#x003E;10 from a comparison of symptomatic COVID-19 cases versus anonymized sera from healthy adults pre-dating 2019 (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), to estimate the proportion of individuals showing background antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Commercial chemiluminescent (CLIA) antibody assay</title>
<p>Total antibody (IgA, IgG and IgM) against recombinant spike (S1) protein was determined using the VITROS 5600 analyser (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Rochester, New York) according to manufacturer instructions. This is a Health Canada and FDA-licensed qualitative assay with reported performance and in-house validation indicating sensitivities &#x003E;7 days post onset range between 96&#x0025; and 100&#x0025; and specificities from 99&#x0025; to 100&#x0025; (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>The following information about participants was collected by questionnaire: age, sex, the first three digits of their postal code, whether they were health care workers and the type of profession, their history of travel outside BC since January 1, 2020, and history of COVID-19 symptoms and testing. SARS-CoV-2-exposed cases were defined by a positive result on the commercial CLIA assay, confirmed by antibody profiling on the multiplex assay. SARS-CoV-2-unexposed cases were defined by a negative result on the commercial CLIA assay, validated using the multiplex assay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2i">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was calculated by dividing the number of SARS-CoV-2-exposed (positive) cases by the total number of participants recruited, and adjusted for bias due to false positive and false negative tests using the Greenland method (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Differences in proportions were calculated using a Fisher exact test, with significance threshold at <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.05. Hierarchical clustering of antibody levels (based on the multiple assay), was performed on log-transformed, z-score normalized serology data, using the complete linkage agglomeration method and Euclidean distance measures. Correlation between antibody levels and metavariables was computed using Spearman correlation, adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate method (FDR 5&#x0025;). Analyses were conducted in R Studio version 3.6.2 and GraphPad Prism version 8.4.</p>

<p>To gain insights into participants&#x2019; antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, we measured antibody levels against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, SARS-CoV, and the circulating beta-(HKU1, OC43) and alpha-(229E and NL63) coronaviruses, in the 276 study participants plus three selected COVID-19 convalescent sera (A, B, C), included as positive controls (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2</xref></bold>). All individuals showed high antibody reactivity against circulating coronaviruses, over background.</p>

<p>Three study participants tested positive (CW087, CW0150, FH0037) on the commercial CLIA assay, including the two individuals with a history of COVID-19 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplemental Figure 3</xref></bold>). A clustering analysis based on the multiplex of antibody profiles against the four SARS-CoV-2 antigens of the 276 study participants plus the 3 positive control convalescent sera showed that the three sera that were reactive on the commercial CLIA assay clustered with the three convalescent sera, but distinctly from the 273 other participants (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplemental Figure 4</xref></bold>). Thus, we established a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 1.1&#x0025; [95&#x0025;CI 0.2&#x0025; to 3.1&#x0025;], with 3 seropositive and 273 unexposed participants. After adjustment for bias using point estimates of specificity and sensitivity of the CLIA assay, the adjusted seroprevalence estimate in this population was 0.60&#x0025; [95&#x0025;CI 0&#x0025; to 2.71&#x0025;].</p>
<p>The pattern of antibody reactivity for SARS-CoV-2 antigens was quite distinct between seropositive individuals, including the convalescent sera, and unexposed individuals. Exposed seroreactive individuals showed high antibodies against Spike, RBD and the N protein (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplemental Figure 5A</xref></bold>). However, unexposed ones showed variably high antibodies against Spike or RBD (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplemental Figure 5B, C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The clinical characteristics of the three SARS-CoV-2-exposed participants are shown in <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>. Two out of the three exposed seroreactive participants were HCW: one a pediatric HCW and one a non-pediatric HCW. There was no difference therefore in seroprevalence between HCW and non-HCW, or between pediatric and non-pediatric HCW (1.0&#x0025; vs 1.0&#x0025;; <italic>P</italic>=1.00 and 0.7&#x0025; vs 1.6&#x0025;; <italic>P</italic>=0.54, respectively).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Positive antibody reactivity against RBD, N and S-2P native spike proteins was estimated to occur in 7.3&#x0025; [95&#x0025;CI 4.5&#x0025; to 11.1&#x0025;], 48.7 [95&#x0025;CI 42.7&#x0025; &#x2013; 54.8&#x0025;] and 82.4&#x0025; [95&#x0025;CI 77.4&#x0025; to 86.7&#x0025;] of the 273 unexposed participants, respectively. A clustering analysis based on these data showed that antibody reactivity among these unexposed participants was evenly distributed according to age, sex, HCW status, travel history and on whether participants thought they had COVID-19 symptoms (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). Moreover, we detected no significant correlations between antibody reactivity for any SARS-CoV-2 antigens, age, sex, recruitment site or travel history (P values from 0.36 to 0.90 adjusted at 5&#x0025; FDR). On the other hand, we did detect modest correlation between antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, and HKU1, NL63 and X229E, with Spearman rho values ranging from 0.130 - 0.224 for 7 significant (FDR 5&#x0025;), out of 16 relevant correlations with circulating coronaviruses (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>; <bold>Supplemental Table 1</bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We estimated the seroprevalence from a direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure to be 0.60&#x0025; [95&#x0025;CI 0&#x0025; to 2.71&#x0025;] in this population mainly composed of HCW in the greater Vancouver area. Data were confirmed using both a multiplex and commercial CLIA assays with 100&#x0025; (6/6) agreement. Reported SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence data in populations after the first wave vary widely across the world because of various factors, including the timing of sampling in relation to the pandemic; how countries managed to control spread of the virus; the target population of the study; and the assay used. Highest rates were reported in Sweden in May (7.3&#x0025;) (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), Geneva in April/early May (10.8&#x0025;) (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and Madrid in late April/early May (&#x003E;10&#x0025;) (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); lowest rates were reported in BC (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimate from the current study is consistent with data published by the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) and obtained between May 15 and 27, 2020, which reported a 0.55&#x0025; seroprevalence among 885 residual sera obtained from an outpatient laboratory network in the Lower Mainland of BC; their study population represents a wider geographical catchment and did not specifically target HCW (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The current study confirms that transmission of COVID-19 in BC after the first wave was low, even among HCW, contrasting with a high seroprevalence reported among HCW in other studies (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
<p>The antibody detection combining a commercial and highly sensitive multiplex assays to detect multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens allowed us to distinguish antibody profiles between exposed and unexposed participants, and to identify that a significant proportion of unexposed individuals display antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This result is consistent with the highly prevalent frequency T cell reactivity detected in about 40&#x0025; of non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals in recent studies (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and with another smaller study where 12 out of 95 pre-pandemic sera exhibited cross-reactive IgG antibody reactivity with conserved epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S2 and N), using a flow cytometry method validated by ELISA (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Previous seroprevalence studies have either used single-antigen assays, focused on SARS-CoV-2, or, in the latter case, examined cross-reactivity in selected sera (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, the current study is remarkable by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity at the population level.</p>
<p>The antigen source of SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity in a relatively high proportion of individuals in the study is unclear. About 25&#x0025; of participants in this study thought that they had experienced COVID-19 symptoms in the past. However, because the number of reported COVID-19 cases in BC was low, it seems unlikely that this antibody reactivity results from a direct exposure to the virus; most likely, this antibody reactivity in unexposed individuals reflects heterologous antigen cross-reactivity. On the other hand, antibody cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and circulating coronaviruses was modest, although this is predicted to occur, particularly within beta-coronaviruses, owing to relatively high sequence similarity (35-40&#x0025; for nucleocapsid and spike proteins) (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Antibody cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is also expected, due to &#x003E;75&#x0025; sequence identity between the spike proteins from these two viruses (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Notably, evidence of cross-neutralization between circulating coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), raises a possibility that this pre-existing immunity may alter the clinical course of COVID-19. However, answering this question requires large follow-up studies.</p>
<p>This study has limitations. First, its cross-sectional design and lack of follow-up makes it impossible to establish whether the antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in unexposed individuals may confer any immune protection. Second, the non-random method of recruitment method is likely to introduce a selection bias towards people who wanted to get tested for COVID-19 antibodies. Third, there is a possibility that a previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure may be underestimated by serology because of lack of sensitivity, especially early on (&#x003C;7 days) and possibly also in asymptomatic individuals (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, the low number of reported cases means that this is unlikely to have represented many individuals in BC. Fourth, the small sample size limited the power for correlation analyses and the precision of estimates.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study reports frequent and variable antibody reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in adults from the greater Vancouver area despite a low overall seroprevalence and low evidence of direct exposure to the virus after the first wave.</p>
