<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The B.1.1.7 strain, also referred to as Alpha variant, is a variant strain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Alpha variant is considered to possess higher transmissibility compared to the strains previously circulating in England. This paper proposes a new method to estimate the selective advantage of a mutant strain over another strain using the time course of strain frequencies and the distribution of the serial interval of infections. This method allows the instantaneous reproduction numbers of infections to vary over calendar time. The proposed method also assumes that the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains is constant. Applying the method to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from England, the instantaneous reproduction number of the B.1.1.7 strain was estimated to be 26.6&#x2013;45.9% higher than previously circulating strains in England. This result indicates that control measures should be strengthened by 26.6&#x2013;45.9% when the B.1.1.7 strain is newly introduced to a country where viruses with similar transmissibility to the preexisting strain in England are predominant.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has rapidly evolved since its introduction to the human population in 2019. In December 2020, Public Health England detected a new cluster of SARS-CoV-2 viruses phylogenetically distinct from the other strains circulating in the United Kingdom (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Chand et al. 2020</xref>). These viruses were assigned the lineage name B.1.1.7 following the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages (PANGO) nomenclature (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al. 2020b</xref>). The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the lineage as a variant of concern (VOC) in December 2020, and it is now known as VOC Alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">World Health Organization 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>It was retrospectively determined that the B.1.1.7 strain was first detected in England in September 2020, and the number of infections with this strain increased in October and November in 2020 (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Chand et al. 2020</xref>). By February 2021, the B.1.1.7 strain accounted for 95% of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in England (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Davies et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have compared the transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 strain to that of previously circulating strains. Davies et al. estimated that the reproduction number <italic>R</italic> (the average number of secondary infections generated by a given primary infection) of the B.1.1.7 strain is 43&#x2013;90% (95% credible interval [CrI]: 38&#x2013;130%) higher than preexisting strains (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Davies et al. 2021</xref>). However, other models found different ranges of estimates in their multiplicative increase in <italic>R</italic>. Grabowski et al. estimated a 83&#x2013;118% increase with a confidence interval of 71&#x2013;140% compared to previously circulating strains in England (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Grabowski et al. 2021</xref>). Volz et al. estimated a 50&#x2013;100% increase in <italic>R</italic> using data from England (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Volz et al. 2021</xref>), while Washington et al. estimated a 35&#x2013;45% increase using data from the United States using Volz&#x2019;s method (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Washington et al. 2021</xref>). As well, Chen et al. estimated a 49&#x2013;65% increase using data from Switzerland (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2021</xref>). Strong control measures including movement restrictions and ban on meeting and event were taken to respond to the introduction of a strain with high transmissibility. Thus, the <italic>R</italic> may change over time during the course of an epidemic during which new SARS-CoV-2 variant strains emerge.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains. Based on Fraser&#x2019;s method to estimate the instantaneous reproduction number using a renewal equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fraser 2007</xref>), our method allows the reproduction number to vary over calendar time. Our approach is also based on the Maynard Smith&#x2019;s model of allele frequencies in adaptive evolution, which assumes that the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains is constant over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Maynard Smith and Haigh 1974</xref>). Applying the developed method to the sequence data in England using the serial interval distribution of COVID-19 estimated by Nishiura et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Nishiura et al. 2020</xref>), we estimated the change in the instantaneous reproduction number of B.1.1.7 strains compare to that of strains previously circulating in England.</p>

<title>Sequence data</title>
<p>Nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV-2 viruses were obtained from the GISAID EpiCoV database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Shu and McCauley 2017</xref>) on March 1, 2021. Nucleotide sequences of viruses detected in England were selected and aligned to the reference amino acid sequence of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (YP_009724390) using DIAMOND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Buchfink et al. 2015</xref>). The aligned nucleotide sequences were translated into amino acid sequences, then were aligned with the reference amino acid sequence using MAFFT (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Katoh et al. 2002</xref>). Amino acid sequences having either an ambiguous amino acid or more than ten gaps were excluded from the rest of analyses. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the amino acids on the spike protein used to characterize the B.1.1.7 strain, as retrieved from the PANGO database (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al. 2020b</xref>).</p>

<p>We divided amino acid sequences into three groups based on the amino acids shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The first group consists of sequences having all the B.1.1.7-defining amino acids in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We call a virus in this group a &#x201C;B.1.1.7 strain&#x201D;. The second group contains sequences that have none of the B.1.1.7-defining substitutions. We call a virus in this group a &#x201C;non-B.1.1.7 strain&#x201D;. The third group is a set of sequences that have at least one but incomplete set of the B.1.1.7-defining amino acids. We call a strain in the third group a &#x201C;B.1.1.7-like strain&#x201D;. <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the number of sequences categorized into each group. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the daily numbers of GISAID sequences of B.1.1.7 strains, non-B.1.1.7 strains and B.1.1.7-like strains detected in England from September 1, 2020 to February 19, 2021. We used the number of B.1.1.7 strains and non-B.1.1.7 strains for the rest of the analyses. B.1.1.7-like strains were excluded from the analyses as it is unclear whether they have the same transmissibility as B.1.1.7 strains. These numbers are provided in Supplementary Table 1.</p>

<title>Serial interval distribution</title>
<p>The serial interval is the time from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in a secondary case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Nishiura et al. 2020</xref>).

<title>Model of Advantageous Selection</title>
<p>Let us suppose that we have a large population of viruses consisting of strains of two genotypes <italic>A</italic> and <italic>a</italic>, of which frequency in the viral population at a calendar date <italic>t</italic> are <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), respectively. Suppose also that genotype <italic>A</italic> is a mutant of <italic>a</italic> that emerged at time <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p>We assume that a virus of genotype <italic>A</italic> generates 1 &#x00B1; <italic>s</italic> times as many secondary transmissions as those of genotype <italic>a</italic>. Then, <italic>s</italic> can be considered as the coefficient of selective advantage in adaptive evolution. As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Maynard Smith and Haigh (1974)</xref>, the frequency of viruses of allele <italic>A</italic> after <italic>n</italic> transmissions, <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>, satisfies the following equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21253775v4_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Maynard Smith&#x2019;s formulation of allele frequency can be extended using the concept of instantaneous reproduction numbers of infectious diseases. The instantaneous reproduction number is defined as the average number of people someone infected at time <italic>t</italic> could expect to infect given that conditions remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fraser 2007</xref>). Let <italic>I</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) be the number of infections by viruses of either genotype <italic>A</italic> or <italic>a</italic> at calendar time <italic>t</italic> and <italic>g</italic>(<italic>i</italic>) be the probability mass function of serial intervals, defined in the previous subsection. Suppose that instantaneous reproduction numbers of genotypes <italic>A</italic> and <italic>a</italic> at calendar time <italic>t</italic> are <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), respectively. Assuming that the distribution of generation time of a disease can be approximated by the serial interval distribution, the following equations give the discrete version of Fraser&#x2019;s instantaneous reproduction numbers of infections by genotype <italic>A</italic> and <italic>a</italic> at time <italic>t</italic>.

</disp-formula>
Suppose that <italic>g</italic>(<italic>i</italic>) is small enough to be neglected for <italic>i</italic> &#x003C; 1 and <italic>i</italic> &#x003E; <italic>l</italic>, then <italic>g</italic>(<italic>i</italic>) can be truncated and the above formula can be treated as follows.

<disp-formula id="eqn5">

</disp-formula>
Since a virus of genotype <italic>A</italic> generates 1 &#x00B1; <italic>s</italic> times as many secondary transmissions as those of genotype <italic>a</italic>, the following equation holds
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21253775v4_eqn6.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
for each calendar time <italic>t</italic> &#x2265; <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>. Next we assume that for all infections at calendar time <italic>t</italic>, the difference in the number of infections at the time when previous generations became infected can be regarded as considerably small, i.e.

<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21253775v4_eqn7.gif"/></alternatives>

The frequency of genotype <italic>A</italic> in the viral population at calendar time <italic>t, q</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>), can be modeled as follows:

The initial frequency of B.1.1.7 among non-B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.7 strains at the emergence in England, <italic>q</italic><sub>0</sub>, was estimated to be 0.00556 with its 95% confidence intervals from 0.00534 to 0.00581.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper, the selective advantage of the B.1.1.7 strain over non-B.1.1.7 strains in England was estimated to be 0.344 with a 95% CI from 0.343 to 0.346, assuming that the serial intervals followed the lognormal distribution with a log mean of 1.38 and log standard deviation of 0.56. The date of emergence of B.1.1.7 strains in England was estimated to be September 20, 2020 with its 95% confidence interval from September 17, 2020 to September 20, 2020. The initial frequency of B.1.1.7 among all sequences except B.1.1.7-like strains at the time of emergence in England was estimated to be 0.00556 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.00534 to 0.00581. The sensitivity analyses showed that the estimate of selective advantage was affected by parameters of assumed lognormal serial interval distribution.</p>
<p>Accounting for the serial interval distribution, the instantaneous reproduction number of B.1.1.7 strain were estimated to be 26.6&#x2013;45.9% higher than previous strains circulating in England.</p>
<p>Our analyses showed that the B.1.1.7 strain possesses 26.6&#x2013;45.9% higher transmissibility compared to previously circulating strains in England. This result suggests that control measures should be strengthened by 26.6&#x2013;45.9% when the B.1.1.7 is newly introduced in a country where viruses with similar transmissibility to the preexisting strain in England are predominant.</p>
<p>Our estimate is lower than some previously published estimates. For example, Volz et al. estimated a 50&#x2013;100% increase in the reproduction number using PCR data from England (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Volz et al. 2021</xref>). The reason for this discrepancy could be the difference in the assumed serial interval distributions. In this paper, we used the serial interval data published by Nishiura et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Nishiura et al. 2020</xref>). Other groups used different datasets, and there is some variation between these estimated values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Rai et al. 2021</xref>). Volz et al. assumes a generation time distribution with a mean of 6.4 days based on the results by Bi et al. (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Bi et al. 2020</xref>). However, Ali et al. have reported that the serial interval estimated using data from China before January 22, 2020 was longer than estimates after January 22, 2020 (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al. 2020</xref>). The serial interval estimated by Bi et al. contains data from before January 22, 2020 and there might be some possibility that the estimated serial interval does not reflect the current situation. This important limitation originates from the uncertainty surrounding serial interval distribution.</p>
<p>Our analysis assumes that samples are collected from a well-mixed population in England. However, the situation may vary from region to region in England. Several observed frequencies in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> were located outside the 95% confidence interval. The reason for this could be that samples were collected from different locations in England and regional difference in the viral population may be the cause of the fluctuation of observed frequencies.</p>
<p>Our estimation method is based on the principle that the expected frequency of a mutant strain among all strains can be determined from those in the previous generation using the serial interval distribution of infections. The method assumes that the selective advantage of a mutant strain over previously circulating strains is constant over time, which is based on Maynard Smith&#x2019;s model of allele frequencies in adaptive evolution. In line with Fraser&#x2019;s method for estimating the instantaneous reproduction number, our method allows reproduction numbers of strains to change during the target period of analysis. Thus, the proposed method removes the assumption that the reproduction number is constant over time, which is assumed in previous studies. Our method can estimate the selective advantage of viruses in a genotype over the other genotype without estimating the reproduction numbers of viruses of each genotype. Thus, the method can be applicable for the analysis on the selection of new variants even when strong control measures such as lockdown were introduced during the target period of analysis. We think this is the largest contribution of this paper to the field of molecular evolution, population genetics, and infectious disease epidemiology.</p>
<p>As of June 9, 2021, the B.1.1.7 strain has been detected in 135 countries (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al. 2020a</xref>). Estimation of the selective advantage of the B.1.1.7 strains over previously circulating strains in other countries is ongoing. Variant strains originating from Brazil, South Africa, and India also show higher transmissibility compared to previously circulating strains (World Health Organization 2021). There is an urgent need to estimate the selective advantage of these strains. We hope that the methodology developed in this paper proves useful for countries in the world to establish control measures against highly transmissible variants strains.</p>
