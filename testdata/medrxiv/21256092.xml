<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are losing efficacy against emerging variants and may not protect against future novel coronavirus outbreaks, emphasizing the need for more broadly protective vaccines. To inform the development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine, we investigated the presence and specificity of cross-reactive antibodies against the spike (S) proteins of human coronaviruses (hCoV) after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We found an 11 to 123-fold increase in antibodies binding to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as a 2 to 4-fold difference in antibodies binding to seasonal hCoVs in COVID-19 convalescent sera compared to pre-pandemic healthy donors, with the S2 subdomain of the S protein being the main target for cross-reactivity. In addition, we detected cross-reactive antibodies to all hCoV S proteins after SARS-CoV-2 S protein immunization in macaques, with higher responses for hCoV more closely related to SARS-CoV-2. These findings support the feasibility of and provide guidance for development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One and a half year after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), the pandemic is still a major global issue with unprecedented consequences on healthcare systems and economies. Following the rapid initiation of many COVID-19 vaccine studies, the first vaccines are already FDA/EMA approved and mass vaccination campaigns are rolled out to hopefully soon subdue this pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, these vaccines might have reduced efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, as was already shown for several approved vaccines when tested for safety and effectiveness against the B1.351 (501Y.V2) SARS-CoV-2 variant which is currently dominating the epidemic in South Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To anticipate emerging variants, more broadly protective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are desirable. However, the ultimate goal should be a pan-coronavirus vaccine, which would be able to induce broad immunity and protection against multiple coronaviruses, thereby preparing us for future outbreaks.</p>
<p>New coronaviruses that infect humans (hCoVs) emerge frequently and SARS-CoV-2 is the fifth to be discovered in less than two decades, bringing the total up to seven<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. These include the seasonal betacoronaviruses hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-HKU1 as well as alphacoronaviruses hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E, which usually cause mild respiratory symptoms and account for approximately 5-30% of common colds during the winter season<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In contrast, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV are far more pathogenic and led to epidemics in 2003 and 2013-2015, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, resulting in mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of patients, while only a small group of patients develop (bilateral) pneumonia which can rapidly deteriorate in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Despite the lower pathogenicity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the high infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 results in large numbers of hospitalizations and deaths worldwide.</p>
<p>The majority of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are based on the Spike (S) glycoprotein, a homotrimeric glycoprotein that is present on the surface of all coronaviruses and is the main target of protective antibodies. The S protein plays a pivotal role in viral entry and consists of an S1 subdomain including the receptor binding domain (RBD) and an S2 subdomain containing the fusion peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to the S protein of SARS-CoV (&#x223C;75% amino acid sequence identity), shows less similarity to MERS-CoV S protein (&#x223C;50% identity) and is more distinct from the S proteins of the seasonal hCoVs (&#x223C;25-30% identity)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Although this sequence identity is considered low from the perspective of eliciting cross-reactive antibodies by vaccination, several studies observed cross-reactivity of COVID-19 sera against other hCoVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, the isolation and engineering of broader hCoV monoclonal antibodies has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we identify broad hCoV antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We identify the S2 subdomain as a prominent target for cross-reactive antibodies and demonstrate that cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with a SARS-CoV-2 S protein nanoparticle vaccine elicit detectable antibody responses to other hCoVs. These results will guide the development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Convalescent COVID-19 sera contain robust IgG responses to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein</title>
<p>Sera from 50 PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, aged 22 to 75 years, who suffered from a range of COVID-19 disease severities were obtained 4-6 weeks after symptom onset (Supplementary Table 1). A custom Luminex assay was used to measure IgG antibody levels to the pre-fusion stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in these convalescent COVID-19 sera and compared to pre-pandemic healthy donor sera.</p>
<p>Sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients showed 990-fold higher antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to pre-pandemic healthy donor sera (median 3.8 log<sub>10</sub> vs. 0.8 log<sub>10</sub> Median Fluorescent Intensity (MFI), p&#x003C;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). This is in line with a positive serological response in all but one of the participants using the commercially available WANTAI SARS-CoV-2 RBD total Immunoglobulin serum ELISA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and Supplementary Table 1). When subdividing the convalescent patients based on admission status, 4-fold higher antibody levels were observed for hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients (median 4.1 log<sub>10</sub> vs. 3.5 log<sub>10</sub> MFI, p&#x003C;0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacity was also significantly higher (5-fold) in hospitalized patients (3.6 log<sub>10</sub> vs. 2.9 log<sub>10</sub> MFI, p&#x003C;0.0001) and antibody levels and neutralization capacity were strongly correlated in all patients (Spearman r &#x003D; 0.735, p&#x003C;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). An 8-fold higher antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was observed in the oldest age group of COVID-19 patients (age &#x003E; 60) compared to the youngest age group (age &#x003C; 35) (4.1 log<sub>10</sub> vs. 3.2 log<sub>10</sub> MFI, p&#x003C;0.001), which is in line with age being a risk factor for severe COVID-19 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. No difference in antibody levels was observed between sex (p=0.71 Mann-Whitney U test). These findings were confirmed with a principal component analysis, which showed two distinct groups based on hospital admission status, and indicated age as an important contributing variable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall, these results are consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Convalescent COVID-19 sera are cross-reactive with all hCoV S proteins</title>
<p>Next, we measured IgG binding to the S proteins of other hCoVs: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-229E and hCoV-NL63. We found significantly higher levels of antibodies binding to all hCoV S proteins in convalescent COVID-19 sera compared to pre-pandemic healthy donor sera, with the largest difference for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S protein (123 and 11-fold difference between medians, respectively) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). For the circulating seasonal hCoVs, a 2 to 4-fold difference in median levels of antibodies binding to the S proteins was observed; hCoV-OC43 (4.2-fold, p&#x003C;0.0001), hCoV-HKU1 (4.3-fold, p&#x003C;0.0001), hCoV-229E (3.8-fold, p&#x003C;0.0001) and hCoV-NL63 (1.8-fold, p&#x003C;0.01). No such difference was found for the control protein Tetanus toxoid (0.8-fold, p=0.85) (Supplementary Fig. 2a).</p>

</fig>
<p>To further explore the specificity of the cross-reactive antibodies in convalescent COVID-19 sera, we performed a depletion with soluble SARS-CoV-2 S protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 3). Depletion of convalescent COVID-19 sera resulted in a 92% reduction of antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The reduction of antibodies binding to the other hCoV S proteins was strongest for SARS-CoV (61% mean reduction) and MERS-CoV (25%). A more modest reduction of signal was observed for hCoV-OC43 (13% mean reduction) and hCoV-229E S protein (6%) and we observed no depletion of antibodies binding to hCoV-HKU1 (2%) and hCoV-NL63 (&#x2212;2%). On the individual level, some patients showed up to 72%, 70% and 34% reduction of antibodies binding to hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E and hCoV-HKU1 S protein after depletion, respectively. No reduction in signal was observed for the control protein Tetanus toxoid after SARS-CoV-2 S depletion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 2b). Antibodies binding to other hCoV S proteins in pre-pandemic healthy donor sera did not decrease after depletion (Supplementary Fig. 2c). These depletion experiments corroborate the finding that convalescent COVID-19 sera contain cross-reactive antibodies able to recognize other hCoV S proteins. We observed the highest cross-reactivity for the more closely related hCoVs (Supplementary Table 3). Indeed, the level of cross-reactivity expressed as the reduction of binding antibodies after depletion by SARS-CoV-2 S protein was associated with the level of sequence identity (Spearman r=0.83, p=0.06) (Supplementary Fig. 4).</p>
<p>To further explore the possible functionality of these cross-reactive antibodies, we investigated the correlation between hCoV S protein binding antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers. In addition to the observed correlation between SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibody levels and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we found a moderate correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and antibodies binding to SARS-CoV S protein (r &#x003D; 0.545, P&#x003C;0.0001), a weak correlation with antibodies that bind to MERS-CoV, hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-229E S protein (r &#x003D; 0.324, 0.308, 0.320 respectively, all p &#x003C;0.05) and no correlation with antibodies binding to hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-NL63 S protein (r &#x003D; 0.188 and -0.095, p &#x003E;0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 6). These correlations suggest that cross-reactive antibodies form a minor component of the neutralizing antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also investigated if there was an association between cross-reactivity and disease severity with a principal component analysis. Antibodies binding to other hCoV S proteins did not contribute to the separation between patients based on admission status as clearly as was seen for SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibody levels, suggesting a limited impact of cross-reactive antibodies on disease severity (Supplementary Fig. 5).</p>

<title>Cross-reactive antibodies preferentially target the S2 subdomain</title>
<p>To determine the main target on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein for cross-reactive antibodies, we performed a depletion experiment in which we compared the reduction of IgG binding to hCoV S proteins after depleting the sera with soluble SARS-CoV-2 S1 or S2 subdomains. After depletion with the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subdomain, a 48%, 20% and 19% mean reduction of signal was observed for antibodies binding to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-OC43 S protein, respectively, while no reduction was observed after S1 depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Absolute MFI values before and after depletion are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7a. For some individuals, depletion rates reached up to 83% for SARS-CoV, 75% for MERS-CoV and 80% for hCoV-OC43 S protein while there were no individuals with substantial reduction of cross-reactive antibodies after S1 depletion. We did not observe significant depletion of antibodies binding to hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-229E S proteins by S1 or S2 subdomains of SARS-CoV-2 at the group level. However, in some individuals the signal was reduced by up to 59% for hCoV-HKU1 and 71% for hCoV-229E S protein following depletion with the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subdomain, while such effects were not observed after S1 subdomain depletion. Changes in antibodies that bind to hCoV-NL63 S protein after depletion with SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 subdomains were comparable to those observed with the control protein Tetanus toxoid and to the reduction in signal for hCoV S in healthy donors (Supplementary Fig. 3 and 7). SARS-CoV-2 S2 subdomain depletion was significantly correlated with S2 sequence identity (r &#x003D; 0.90, p &#x003D; 0.03) while there was no correlation for SARS-CoV-2 S1 subdomain depletion (r &#x003D; 0.23, p &#x003D; 0.67) (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results indicate that S2-specific antibodies have a greater contribution to cross-reactivity than S1-specific antibodies, which is in accordance with the higher conservation of the S2 subdomain compared to the S1 subdomain (Supplementary Table 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 S protein vaccination elicits hCoV cross-reactive antibodies in macaques</title>
<p>The observed cross-reactive antibody response following natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 does not reveal whether these might be <italic>de novo</italic> responses or the result of cross-boosted pre-existing memory from previous hCoV infections. To investigate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to induce <italic>de novo</italic> cross-reactive antibodies against hCoVs, we investigated the serum of six cynomolgus macaques which were vaccinated three times with pre-fusion stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein coupled to I53-50 nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The vaccination response was studied by comparing serum IgG binding to hCoV S proteins after three vaccinations (week 12) to the pre-immunization baseline (week 0). We observed that all macaques developed detectable antibodies that bind to all hCoV S proteins. Antibodies binding to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and hCoV-OC43 S proteins were increased compared to baseline by 3313-, 168-, and 106-fold, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). This cross-reactivity was already detectable two weeks after the first immunization (Supplementary Fig. 8a). The induction of antibodies that bind to hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-229E S proteins was relatively low with a 39- and 16-fold increase from baseline, respectively. Antibodies binding to hCoV-NL63 S protein showed only a 6-fold increase from baseline and there was no increase observed for Tetanus toxoid (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 8b and c). All comparisons were statistically significant except for the Tetanus toxoid. Using the SARS-CoV-2 S protein depletion assay, a 79%, 98% and 99% mean reduction of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and hCoV-OC43 S protein, respectively, was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). In addition, depletion also resulted in a mean reduction of antibodies binding to proteins hCoV-229E S (92%), hCoV-HKU1 S (92%) and hCoV-NL63 S (75%). Virtually no depletion (3%) was observed for the control protein Tetanus toxoid (Supplementary Fig. 9). Together, these results demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is capable of inducing cross-reactive antibodies to both alpha and beta hCoVs, in macaques that we assume have no pre-existing hCoV immunity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As mass vaccination campaigns take place around the globe, there is optimism that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be subdued. However, there will likely be future challenges with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as with entirely new hCoVs. A number of studies have shown that neutralizing antibodies induced by COVID-19 vaccines have substantially reduced activity against some SARS-CoV-2 variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, development of broader SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is needed, with a pan-coronavirus vaccine as the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>In this study, we show that convalescent COVID-19 sera have higher levels of antibodies that bind to other hCoV S proteins compared to pre-pandemic healthy donors. We confirmed this cross-reactivity by showing that SARS-CoV-2 S protein could partially deplete antibodies binding to all hCoV S proteins except hCoV-NL63 in COVID-19 patient sera, while no effect of SARS-CoV-2 S protein depletion was observed in healthy donor sera. Additionally, we see that the elevation of hCoV S antibody levels and the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to deplete these antibodies is highest for hCoV S proteins that share most sequence homology with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Cross-reactive antibodies can be the result of <italic>de novo</italic> responses or due to cross-boosting of pre-existing hCoV immunity. Others have shown cross-reactive antibodies resulting from boosting of pre-existing immunity after natural infection in COVID-19 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. We further explored the possibility to induce <italic>de novo</italic> cross-reactive antibodies by vaccination in a cynomolgus macaque model. These macaques are assumed na&#x00EF;ve for hCoVs although infections of macaques have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Because of low baseline antibody levels, we expect no previous exposure and therefore solely a <italic>de novo</italic> antibody response following vaccination. All SARS-CoV-2 S protein nanoparticle immunized macaques showed detectable antibodies binding to all hCoV S proteins which could also be depleted with SARS-CoV-2 S protein. These responses after immunization with a vaccine containing a similar pre-fusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S protein as many current COVID-19 vaccines, demonstrate that these narrow focused vaccines might already induce low levels of cross-reactive antibodies. However, the strength of the response should be an important consideration, as low levels of antibodies to viral antigens and/or the presence of predominantly non-neutralizing antibodies could potentially lead to Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Currently, ADE has not been reported widely for SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and for other hCoVs there is no consensus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In addition, it remains unclear in clinical studies if pre-existing immunity against other hCoVs influence the severity of COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In these 50 COVID-19 patients, we did not find evidence of a clear association between the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and COVID-19 disease severity.</p>
<p>As we show that most of the cross-reactivity is targeting the S2 subdomain of the S protein, we propose that this subdomain should receive more attention in vaccine design. Interestingly, although most neutralizing antibodies target the S1 subdomain including the RBD, protective neutralizing antibodies targeting the S2 subdomain have also been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Furthermore, analogous to some influenza virus hemagglutinin stem antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, antibody effector functions might also contribute to protective immunity by S2 antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Additional possibilities to improve breadth include the use of consensus or mosaic vaccine designs similar to what has been done in HIV-1 vaccine research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, or the inclusion of an S2-based booster vaccine after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to amplify and broaden the response.</p>
<p>The results from this study on the presence and specificity of cross-reactive antibodies to other hCoVs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination, emphasize the feasibility of broad coronavirus vaccines and may guide future vaccine designs.</p>

<p>A prefusion stabilized S protein ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with a T4 trimerization domain and hexahistidine (His) tag were previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. A prefusion stabilized S protein ectodomains construct of hCoV-HKU1 was designed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.

The same procedure was used to generate prefusion stabilized S proteins of MERS-CoV, hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-OC43. For the prefusion stabilized S protein ectodomain of hCoV-229E, a gene encoding amino acids 1-1082, with proline substitutions at positions 871 and 872, was ordered. The prefusion stabilized S protein ectodomain construct of hCoV-NL63 consisted of amino acids 1-1263 and introduction of proline substitutions at positions 1052 and 1053. For MERS-CoV, a gene encoding amino acids 1-1214 with proline substitutions at positions 1060 and 1061, and the furin cleavage site (amino acids 748-751) replaced with an ASVG sequence.

<p><bold>Supplementary Figure 1. Principal Component Analysis showing the influence of sex and disease severity on the SARS-CoV-2 IgG response</bold>.</p>
<p>A Principal Component Analysis was performed using the following variables: IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S protein (S), RBD and nucleocapsid protein (N), SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, age and days since symptom onset (DSSO). Patients were subdivided based on sex (A) and WHO severity score (B). A description of the WHO severity scoring is found in Supplementary Table 1. The loading of the principal component plot by each variable is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.</p>
