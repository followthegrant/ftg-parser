<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Despite that sulfated <italic>O</italic>-linked glycans are abundant on ovarian cancer (OC) glycoproteins, their regulation during cancer development and involvement in cancer pathogenesis remain unexplored. We characterized <italic>O</italic>-glycans carrying sulfation on galactose residues and compared their expression to defined sulfotransferases regulated during OC development. Desialylated sulfated oligosaccharides were released from acidic glycoproteins in the cyst fluid from one patient with a benign serous cyst and one patient with serous OC. Oligosaccharides characterized by LC-MS<sup>n</sup> were identified as core 1 and core 2 <italic>O</italic>-glycans up to the size of decamers, and with 1-4 sulfates linked to GlcNAc residues and to C-3 and/or C-6 of Gal. To study the specificity of the potential ovarian sulfotransferases involved, Gal3ST2 (Gal-3S)-, Gal3ST4 (Gal-3S)-, and CHST1 (Gal-6S)-encoding expression plasmids were transfected individually into CHO cells also expressing the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1/mouse immunoglobulin G2b (PSGL-1/mIg G2b) fusion protein and the human core 2 transferase (GCNT1). Characterization of the PSGL-1/mIg G2b <italic>O</italic>-glycans showed that Gal3ST2 preferentially sulfated Gal on the C-6 branch of core 2 structures and Gal3ST4 preferred Gal on the C-3 branch independently if core-1 or-2. CHST1 sulfated Gal residues on both the C-3 (core 1/2) and C-6 branches of core 2 structures. Using serous ovarian tissue micro array, Gal3ST2 was found to be decreased in tissue classified as malignant compared to tissues classified as benign or borderline, with the lowest expression in poorly differentiated malignant tissue. Neither Gal3ST4 nor CHST1 were differentially expressed in benign, borderline or malignant tissue, and there was no correlation between expression level and differentiation stage. The data displays a complex sulfation pattern of <italic>O</italic>-glycans on OC glycoproteins and that aggressiveness of the cancer is associated with a decreased expression of the Gal3ST2 transferase.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecological cancer with a 46% survival rate five years after diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The poor prognosis is related to the fact that most of the patients (75%) get their diagnosis first in the advanced stage of the disease. Partly, this is due to the asymptomatic nature of early-stage OC. Today there are limited diagnostic and imaging tools available to distinguish between cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas, which prevents a correct and early diagnosis and subsequent appropriate treatment. The most frequently used marker for OC in blood is the mucin glycoprotein MUC16 (CA125). CA125/MUC16 has high prognostic value for post therapy follow up but has poor sensitivity for diagnosing ovarian carcinomas in the early stages.</p>
<p>The presence of mucin-type glycoproteins in ovarian tumor tissue and cyst fluid have been known for more than 70 years, and they have been shown to carry ABO and Lewis blood group glycan motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Using proteomics and immunohistochemistry, we and others have shown that in addition to CA125/MUC16 there are other mucins in ovarian tumor cyst fluids, namely MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC6, and MUC1, although their absolute and relative abundances are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Mucin glycosylation changes involving truncation of <italic>O</italic>-glycans are observed in many epithelial cancers, most likely providing cancer cells beneficial properties to spread in the body and to avoid detection by the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The occurrence and potential use of cancer associated carbohydrate epitopes (Tn, sialyl Tn, T-antigen, sialyl Lewis a and sialyl Lewis x) on CA125/MUC16 and MUC1 in serum and tissue sections from OC patients for differential diagnosis is currently being explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Less attention has been given the role of sulfation in OC tissue. Increased levels of the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate (CS), a major constituent of the extracellular matrix, and increased mRNA levels of CS-associated sulfotransferases, have been observed in OC [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)]. The limited availability of analytical tools such as antibodies or lectins used for detection and quantitation of sulfated <italic>O</italic>- or <italic>N</italic>-glycans have hindered research within this field.</p>
<p>We have previously characterized the glycosylation on mucin-type proteins from benign and malignant mucinous and serous ovarian tumor cyst fluids using a mass spectrometric approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), where we observed that the highest level of glycan sulfation was found on proteins from serous cystadenomas. Here, we aimed to further investigate sulfation of Gal-residues on <italic>O</italic>-glycans of IC glycoproteins. The sulfated <italic>O</italic>-glycans collected from ovarian tumor cyst fluids from two patients, one diagnosed with a serous benign adenoma, and one diagnosed with a low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC), were sequenced using LC-MS<sup>n</sup> experiments. Using recombinant expression, we tested the specificity of three Gal-sulfotransferase candidates on <italic>O</italic>-glycans, and used serous ovarian tissue microarrays (TMA) probed with antibodies against sulfotransferase candidates, we addressed the question of sulfotransferase regulation during OC development.</p>

<title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title>
<p>Chemicals were from Merck, Sigma-Aldrich if not otherwise stated.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Clinical samples</title>
<p>Ovarian tissue samples and cyst fluids were collected after patients signed informed consent. The collection, storage and analysis procedures were approved by the local Ethics Committee at Sahlgrenska University Hospital (Dnr: S348-02 and S445-08) and abide by the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Ovarian tumor cyst fluids used for LC-MS<sup>n</sup> were purified from two patients as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) from one patient diagnosed with serous cystadenoma and one with a low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) of FIGO stage IIIC (age range of LC-MS<sup>n</sup> analysed patients was 55-85 with plasma CA125 8-2500 U/ml). Data of the patient cohort for the TMA are summarized in Supplemental Table 4.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Preparation of desialylated <italic>O</italic>-glycans from ovarian tumor cyst fluids</title>
<p>Acidic glycoproteins from ovarian tumor cyst fluid samples were purified as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Briefly, acidic glycoproteins were extracted from ovarian tumor cyst fluids using DEAE anion exchange chromatography followed by ethanol precipitation. Glycoproteins were resuspended in 3.5 M urea, and dot-blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes and stained with Direct Blue 71. Oligosaccharides were released by reductive &#x03B2;-elimination from the PVDF membrane as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The reduced glycans were chemically desialylated using 2% acetic acid for 45 minutes at 95&#x00B0;C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Cell culture, expression vectors, transfection and clonal selection, production and purification of PSGL/mIgG2b fusion proteins</title>
<p>To evaluate the specificities of candidate sulfotransferases (CHST1, Gal3ST2 and Gal3ST4) in vitro, plasmids encoding these sulfotransferases were transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) together with plasmids encoding the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1/mouse immunoglobulin G2b (PSGL-1/mIgG2b) fusion protein, with or without the plasmid encoding the &#x03B2;1,6-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (GCNT1) responsible for the synthesis of core 2 <italic>O</italic>-glycans. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in 75-cm<sup>2</sup> T-flasks (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in Dulbecco&#x2019;s modified Eagle&#x2019;s medium (DMEM, Lonza Group Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and were transfected 24 hrs later at a cell confluence of 70-80%. The cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent Kit (Invitrogen). Twenty-four micrograms of plasmid were used for transfection of one 75-cm<sup>2</sup> flask. Plasmids encoding human galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase 2 and 4 mRNA (pEZ-M67-Gal3ST2 and pEZ-M67-Gal3ST4) were obtained from GeneCopoeia (Rockville, MD, USA). The human keratan sulfate Gal-6-sulfotransferase (CHST1) was amplified by PCR from a human placenta cDNA library using forward (5&#x2019;-CGCGGG<underline>AAGCTT</underline>ACCATGCAATGTTCCTGGAAGG-3&#x2019;) and reverse (5&#x2019;-CGCG<underline>GCGGCCGC</underline>TCACGAGAAGGGGCGGAAGTC-3&#x2019;) primers and was swapped into a CDM 8-based vector carrying the CMV promoter using <italic>Hind</italic> III/<italic>Not</italic> I restriction sites. The plasmids harboring PSGL-1/mIgG2b and GCNT1 were constructed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). After an 8-day incubation in 15 ml DMEM with 10% FBS, the supernatant was collected and cells removed by centrifugation at 5020 g for 30 min. The different recombinant PSGL-1/mIgG2b fusion proteins were purified from 15 mL of supernatant by mixing with 30 &#x00B5;L of goat anti-mouse IgG agarose beads in a tube rotated at 4&#x00B0;C for 6 hr. The beads were washed two times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and boiled in LDS non-reducing sample buffer (30 &#x00B5;L, Invitrogen AB) before SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and <italic>O</italic>-glycan analysis. In brief, recombinant proteins were separated on 3-8% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen AB) and electrophoretically blotted onto PVDF membrane (Immobilon P membranes, Millipore, Bellerica, MA) using a semi-dry method. <italic>O</italic>-glycans were released from PVDF membrane stripes using reductive &#x03B2;-elimination as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>LC-MS of <italic>O</italic>-glycans and data assignments</title>
<p>For LC-MS, the glycans were separated on porous graphitized carbon columns (PGC, 5 &#x00B5;m particles, Hypercarb, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) prepared in-house, and with 10 cm length and 250 &#x00B5;m inner diameter. The gradient was 0-40% acetonitrile containing 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate over 60 min, kept at a flow rate of 5-10 &#x03BC;L/min. Mass spectrometric data was collected at low resolution in the negative ion mode using a Thermo Scientific LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA).</p>
<p>MS (collision induced dissociation) analyses of <italic>O</italic>-glycans were performed by repeated injections of the same sample and analyzed with data-dependent MS<sup>n</sup> experiments. The glycans were detected as deprotonated ([M-nH]<sup>n-</sup>) ions. For the LC runs involving MS<sup>2</sup> experiments, MS<sup>2</sup> was performed on the six most abundant ions in every full scan or performed throughout the run on a predetermined ion of interest. For LC runs involving MS<sup>3</sup> and MS<sup>4</sup> analyses (ovarian tumor cyst fluid glycans), data-dependent MS experiments were performed where each target ion was continuously selected for fragmentation throughout the whole run (summarized in Supplemental Table 3). Constant parameters were electrospray voltage 3.5 kV, capillary voltage of -6V, and capillary temperature of 300&#x00B0;C. Full MS scans were collected at <italic>m/z</italic> 380-2000 with an isolation width of <italic>m/z</italic> 2, and normalized collision energy of 35%.</p>
<p>MS spectra were interpreted manually, and the assignment of sequences and annotation of fragment ions were confirmed using freely available software &#x2018;GlycoWorkbench&#x2019;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Reference spectra for sulfated core 1 sequences were collected from PSGL-1/mIgG2b purified from supernatants of transient CHO-K1 transfectants expressing sulfotransferases Gal3ST4, CHST1 and PSGL1/mIgG2b without co-transfection with GCNT1 (see section on recombinant proteins). The following assumptions were made based upon known features of mucin-type <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation: Hex residues are Gal, HexNAc are GlcNAc, reducing end sugar is GalNAc-ol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Tissue Micro Array (TMA) and scoring</title>
<p>Sulfotransferase protein expression levels in serous ovarian tissues were evaluated using TMA with tissue from 323 ovarian tumor specimens (Supplemental Table S4). The construction and scanning of the TMA is described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The paraffin sections were deparaffinated in xylene and then rehydrated. Tris-base pH 9 was used as unmasking solution. The sections were counterstained with Hematoxylin.</p>
<p>The tissue sections were incubated with polyclonal antibodies produced in rabbit: Anti-CHST1 (ARP45495_T100, Aviva Systems Biology), anti-Gal3ST2 or anti-Gal3ST4 (HPA071809 and HPA038137, Prestige Antibodies supported by Human Protein Atlas, Sigma-Aldrich). The antibody dilutions were for CHST1, 1:100; for Gal3ST2, 1:20; and for Gal3ST4, 1:50 in PBS. They were incubated with the tissue for 90 min. Antibody binding was measured using UltraVision Quanto Detection System AP (Thermo Scientific) according to the protocol.</p>
<p>A semiquantitative method &#x2018;quick score&#x2019; (QS) for manual evaluation of tissue staining was applied. Proportion of stained tissue was graded 0-4, based upon percentage of stained tissue within the following intervals: 0 = 0%, 1 = 1-25%, 2 = 26-50%, 3 = 51-75% and 4 = 76-100%. Intensity of the stain was graded 0-3 (negative, weak, moderate, and strong). The scores for proportion and intensity were summed, generating a maximum score value of 7. Every tissue section was scored blindly by pathologist (CM) in duplicates or triplicates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Experimental Design and Statistical Rationale</title>
<p>Chemical desialylation of oligosaccharides from cyst fluids from two patients with benign and malignant epithelial ovarial tumors was performed once due to limited availability. These samples were injected 17 and 14 times (benign and malignant, respectively) each for the targeted MS<sup>n</sup> experiments outlined in Supplemental Table 3. The OC MS data presented in this paper is primarily presented as descriptive. For the study of the specificity of sulfotransferases on recombinantly produced PSGL1/ mIgG2b, the data presented here were generated from one transfection with sulfotransferase Gal3ST2 or two transfections performed with CHST1 and Gal3ST4. Glycosylation from each transfection was analyzed with LC-MS once. TMA sulfotransferase staining and intensity scoring was performed once on the full sample set due to limited availability and validated on a subset (n=28) of serous OC tissue on a separate TMA. Human colon and placenta tissue slides were used as positive controls.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Analyses of desialylated sulfated oligosaccharides from serous ovarian tumor cyst fluids</title>
<p>Oligosaccharides were released by reductive &#x03B2;-elimination from enriched acidic proteins from cyst fluids from two patients, one patient diagnosed with benign tumor, and one diagnosed with malignant LGSC. The oligosaccharides were desialylated to aid MS identification of sulfate location. The <italic>O</italic>-glycans were subjected to analyses with LC-MS<sup>n</sup> using porous graphitized carbon chromatography and negative ion mode. Base peak chromatograms are displayed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, where major peaks are assigned. The LC-MS profiles confirmed that sulfated glycans were abundant in these samples. The degree of sialylation before removal of these residues is compiled in Supplemental Table S2, and also described within a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Major sulfated glycan precursor ions were identified, followed by repeated analyses of the samples using data-dependent MS<sup>n</sup> experiments to ensure sufficient number of MS<sup>2</sup>, MS<sup>3</sup> and MS<sup>4</sup> spectra on the low abundant sulfated compounds. Fifty-four sulfated glycans consisting of 2-10 monosaccharide residues with 1-4 sulfate residues were detected, many as isomeric structures. The general structural theme of identified oligosaccharides is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, and the compiled list of deduced sequences is found in Supplemental Table S1.</p>

<title>Data dependent MS<sup>n</sup> experiments revealed doubly, triply and tetrasulfated glycans with a single Hex linked on the core 2 C-3 branch and extended LacNAc chain linked to the C-6 branch</title>
<p>A general structural theme of the core 2 type sulfated oligosaccharides was found in cyst fluids from the two patients with benign and malignant tumors, with the glycan chain extension restricted to the C-6 arm, and consisting of up to four Hex-HexNAc units (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and Supplemental Table S1). Increasing number of sulfates caused the glycans to bind strongly to the porous graphitized carbon (PGC) column. The largest glycans that were detected here consisted of five Hex, five HexNAc and two sulfate residues (&#x2018;2005-1, -2 and - 3&#x2019;, Supplemental Table S1). These eluted within a minute before the gradient ended, precluding detection of larger glycans eluting later.</p>
<p>In many cases the sulfate residues could be assigned to inner Gal or GlcNAc residues in the glycan. This was supported by the detection of an abundant fragment ion in MS<sup>2</sup> spectra generated from the loss of a terminal non-sulfated Hex, followed by a second MS<sup>3</sup> collision experiment of this ion, displaying the loss of a second, non-sulfated Hex. Most of these compositions were identified to contain sialic acid before desialylation (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that terminal Hex residues are sialylated. An example of the type of structure found is illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> shows the base peak chromatogram of the sulfated glycoforms detected at <italic>m/z</italic> 819<sup>2-</sup>/1639<sup>-</sup>, originating in malignant cyst fluid proteins. The monosaccharide composition corresponded to oligosaccharides consisting of eight residues and two sulfate groups. The deduced sequences in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> are listed in Supplemental Table S1. All were found to be of core 2 type, with a single non-sulfated Hex linked to the reducing HexNAcol, and a second extended disulfated triLacNAc chain carrying sulfate in different positions causing the observed structural variety. The complexity is illustrated by at least five detected chromatographic peaks in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, labelled &#x2018;1639-1&#x2019; to &#x2018;1639-5&#x2019;. The most abundant component (&#x2018;1639-2&#x2019;
s) was found to be sulfated on the two outer HexNAc residues in the triLacNAc unit. Of these &#x2018;1639&#x2019; isomers, the &#x2018;1639-2&#x2019; was the dominating isomer detected in the sample purified from the patient with a benign tumor (Supplemental Table 1). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> displays MS<sup>2</sup> spectra of one of the minor components labelled &#x2018;1639-3&#x2019; only present in the malignant sample.

The presence of intense C-ions at <italic>m/z</italic> 626.6<sup>2-</sup> confirmed the presence of the C6 branch, consisting of six monosaccharide residues and the two sulfates. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> shows the MS<sup>3</sup> spectra for component &#x2018;1639-3&#x2019; collected by the data-dependent MS experiment covering the transition &#x2018;819.3<sup>2-</sup> &#x2192; 738.1<sup>2-</sup>&#x2019; ([M-Hex]<sup>2-</sup>). The most abundant fragment ions at <italic>m/z</italic> 657.2<sup>2-</sup>, were indicative of loss of a second, non-sulfated, terminal Hex residue from the precursor molecule. The detection of sulfated fragment ions at <italic>m/z</italic> 241<sup>-</sup>, 282<sup>-</sup> and 261.5<sup>2-</sup>, supported that those sulfates were linked to a Hex and a HexNAc, respectively, and that these saccharide residues had to be adjacent to each other. Assignment of the disulfated Hex-HexNAc unit within the linear chain was aided by detection of doubly charged B-ions at <italic>m/z</italic> 525.2<sup>2-</sup>, which indicated that this unit had to be part of the five outer monosaccharide residues of the extended C-6 branch. Detection of Y-ions at <italic>m/z</italic> 829<sup>-</sup> and 870<sup>-</sup> in the MS<sup>2</sup> and MS<sup>3</sup> spectra confirmed that one sulfate was present on the first Hex closest to the reducing sugar in the linear C6-branch. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> displays MS<sup>4</sup> spectra covering the transition &#x2018;819.3<sup>2-</sup> &#x2192; 738.1<sup>2-</sup> &#x2192; 657.2<sup>2-</sup>&#x2019; ([M-2Hex]<sup>2-</sup>), thus fragmenting the precursor oligosaccharide at 657.2<sup>2-</sup> which has already lost two Hex residues.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In our previous study, we concluded that fucosylated and sulfated <italic>O</italic>-glycans were potential biomarkers on ovarian serous cyst fluid proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). However, the blood group associated enzymes FUT2 and FUT3 in secretions are not expressed in all individuals. In for example caucasians, approximately 80% express a functional FUT2, and approximately 90% express a functional FUT3. Blood group ABO fucosylation was found to be closely related to the mucinous subtype of OC. Here, we have focused on structural assignment of sulfated glycans from the serous type. The <italic>O</italic>-glycans were desialylated and we performed data-dependent MS<sup>2</sup>, MS<sup>3</sup> and MS<sup>4</sup> experiments, which allowed structural elucidation. Desialylation was performed since sialic acid prevents detailed characterization of sulfation using MS in two ways. First, they give rise to more structural glycoforms which lowers the relative abundance of each component. Second, CID-spectra of larger sialylated glycans are often not very informative, since most collision energy is spent on dissociation of the NeuAc glycosidic bonds.</p>
<p>In our previous study, we reported an overall estimated decrease in the abundance of sulfated glycans on serous cyst fluid proteins from patients diagnosed with malignant forms of OC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). In the current study, we have performed a detailed structural assignment of sulfated <italic>O</italic>-glycans derived from cyst fluid proteins of two patients, one classified as benign, the second as malignant, grade &#x2018;LGSC&#x2019;. The latter was chosen to include a malignant cancer, where we could detect significant amount of sulfation, while in the more aggressive &#x2018;HGSC&#x2019; tumor, their lower level of sulfation would have meant that sulfated glycans would be more difficult to characterize.</p>
<p>Our experiments revealed that ovarian glycoproteins carried sulfated core 1 and 2 <italic>O</italic>-glycans consisting of up to ten residues, with 1-4 sulfates linked via hydroxyl groups to <italic>N</italic>-acetylhexosamine residues or C-3 and C-6 to Gal in repeated LacNAc units on the C-6 branch. The presence of disulfated LacNAc units on glycoproteins from ovarian malignant tissue has previously been described by Shibata el al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Based upon the LC-MS chromatograms of the desialylated sulfated oligosaccharides, no major qualitative or quantitative differences between the two samples could be observed.</p>
<p>Chromatographic profiles of short monosulfated glycans such as the core 1 sulfated T-antigens (HSO<sub>3</sub> &#x002B;Gal&#x03B2;1-3GalNAc) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and sulfated core 2 glycans (HSO<sub>3</sub> &#x002B;Gal&#x03B2;1-3(Gal-GlcNAc&#x03B2;1-6)GalNAc) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) were similar between the two samples analysed. This was also valid for the larger, sulfated glycans shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, with one exception. However, this exception could not be simply explained relating to an activity of a single sulfotransferase, and it remains as an unexplained observation that have to be adresserd on a larger cohort of sampoles. However, as an overall conclusion, MS data indicate that it is the same bulk of sulfated glycans that are present in both the benign and malignant cyst fluid samples. Our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) that pointed towards a decreased level sulfation in malignant ovarian tumors suggests in this report to be mainly due to an overall decrease of sulfation rather than caused by altered activity of a single sulfotransferase, at least not a Gal-S transferase. However, in this report with the aim to thoroughly characterize the nature of sulfation in OC using only two patient samples, extended conclusion of the sulfoglycome in serous OC cannot be drawn.</p>
<p>At current, it is unclear to which proteins ovarian glycans are attached to, and if the sulfation manifest differently on different protein cores. Prime protein candidates for sulfation are the mucin type proteins revealed by immunohistochemistry and proteomics, such as CA125/MUC16, MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC6, and MUC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>We also investigated the relative abundance of sulfotransferases in ovarian tissue between different patient stages. There are 37 human Golgi membrane bound sulfotransferases reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), many have primarily been studied due to their involvement in the sulfation of proteoglycans and/or glycolipids, whereas less is known about their precursor substrate specificity and activity towards glycoproteins. Sulfated glycan motifs on glycoproteins are involved in interactions between leukocytes and the endothelium, such as L-selectin mediated re-circulaton of lymphocytes to lymph nodes or leukocyte extravasation at sites of inflammation, and as ligands for sialic acid binding immunoglobulin like receptors (Siglecs) which participate in the discrimination between &#x2018;self&#x2019; and &#x2018;nonself&#x2019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). For mucins, which are commonly found as gel-forming or transmembrane proteins at mucosal surfaces, sulfated glycans have been proposed to be involved in the interaction and protection against microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>We detected sulfate linked to both Gal and GlcNAc in these samples, and showed that sulfate could be linked both C-3 and C-6 to Gal. Since sulfation on Gal on glycoproteins is less well studied, we chose to explore three sulfotransferases: CHST1, Gal3ST2 and Gal3ST4. Extended mucin type <italic>O</italic>-glycans are commonly composed of repeated poly <italic>N</italic>-acetyllactosamine units [polyLacNAc; (&#x2212;4GlcNAc&#x03B2;1-3Gal&#x03B2;1-)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>], which restricts Gal-3 sulfation only to terminally positioned residues, whereas Gal-6 sulfation occurs both on internal and terminal Gal. CHST1 (synonyms KSGal6ST, C6ST) was cloned 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Its activity was confirmed and characterized by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments observing the incorporation of <sup>35</sup>S at the C6-position of Gal in keratan sulfate, but at a higher rate, to non-glycosaminoglycans on fetuin and to C-6 of Gal in sialyl <italic>N</italic>-acetyllactosamine oligosaccharides (NeuAc&#x03B1;2-3Gal&#x03B2;1-4GlcNAc&#x03B2;1-) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). It has been explored for its involvement in the biosynthesis of L-selectin ligands on high endothelial venules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). During characterization of a monoclonal antibody HMOCC-1 against the ovarian clear cell cancer cell line RMG1, CHST1 was found to play a regulatory role in the formation of the sulfated glycan HMOCC-1 epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). We showed here that CHST1 is extensively expressed in most OC tissues (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). We confirmed its specificity acting on core 2 glycans on PSGL-1/IgG expressed in CHO cells, showing that the enzyme may add sulfate to C-6 of both Gal residues of the core 2 tetrasaccharide NeuAc&#x03B1;2-3Gal&#x03B2;1-3(Gal&#x03B2;1-GlcNAc&#x03B2;1-6)GalNAc.</p>
<p>There are four Gal-3-sulfo transferases described of which three (Gal3ST2, Gal3ST3 and Gal3ST4) are found to act on glycoproteins, and all are found in ovarian tissue. Gal3ST2 (GP3ST) was shown to add sulfate to C-3 of Gal in synthetic or purified oligosaccharides, preferentially on type 1 (-Gal&#x03B2;1-3GlcNAc-) and type 2 (-Gal&#x03B2;1-4GlcNAc-) chains and to a lesser extent on the T-antigen (Gal&#x03B2;1-3GalNAc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). This is in line with our findings, where Gal3ST2 preferentially adds sulfate to the Gal in the LacNAc unit linked C-6 to GalNAc in the core 2 tetrasaccharide (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Analogous, we have previously reported core and branch dependent specificity for <italic>O</italic>-linked glycans for the &#x03B1;1,3 fucosyltransferase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) using the CHO-cell expression approach. Gal3ST4 was initially cloned and characterized 2001 by Seko <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). He reported the incorporation of sulfate to C-3 of Gal linked to GalNAc in the core 2 saccharide Gal&#x03B2;1-3(GlcNAc&#x03B2;1-6)GalNAc, which is concordant to our results. Gal3ST3 was not included in the current study, but is reported to act on core 2 glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nextprot.org">nextprot.org</ext-link> reports RNA levels present in ovarian tissue. The involvement of this enzyme in OC requires further investigation.</p>
<p>Our TMA study showed that protein expression levels of sulfotransferases Gal3ST4 and CHST1 remained the same in serous ovarian tissue from all tumor stages and degree of differentiation, whereas Gal3ST2 levels were decreased in malignant tissue. A decrease in sulfotransferase levels is in line with our previous findings where we used a mass spectrometric approach to semi-quantify sulfated glycans from eight patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). However, our MS data indicates that there is no major change in the sulfated glycoforms in the samples from different patient groups, and it is likely that the overall sulfation decrease as previously indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) must be related to more factors than Gal3ST2, which only can sulfate terminal Gal. There are additional sulfotransferase candidates which may add sulfate to C-3 or C-6 in Gal of glycoproteins and are reported to be expressed in ovarian tissue (Gal3ST3 and CHST3). This may influence the overall sulfation, and further investigation of the role of sulfotransferases adding sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc residues will provide complementary information about the role and regulation of sulfation in serous OC.</p>
