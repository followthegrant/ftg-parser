<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Multiplexed immune cell profiling of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in cancer has improved our understanding of cancer immunology, but complex spatial analyses of tumor-immune interactions in lymphoma are lacking. Here we used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) on 33 cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) to characterize tumor and immune cell architecture and correlate it to clinicopathological features such as cell of origin, gene mutations, and responsiveness to chemotherapy. To understand the poor response of DLBCL to immune check point inhibitors (ICI), we compared our results to IMC data from Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), a cancer highly responsive to ICI, and observed differences in the expression of PD-L1, PD-1, and TIM-3. We created a spatial classification of tumor cells and identified sub-regions of immune activation, immune suppression, and immune exclusion within the topology of DLBCL. Finally, the spatial analysis allowed us to identify markers such as CXCR3, which are associated with penetration of immune cells into immune desert regions, with important implications for engineered cellular therapies.</p><sec>
<title>SIGNIFICANCE</title>
<p>This is the first study to integrate tumor mutational profiling, cell of origin classification, and multiplexed immuno-phenotyping of the TME into a spatial analysis of DLBCL at the single cell level. We demonstrate that, far from being histo-pathologically monotonous, DLBCL has a complex tumor architecture, and that changes in tumor topology can be correlated with clinically relevant features. This analysis identifies candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets such as TIM-3, CCR4, and CXCR3 that are relevant for combination treatment strategies in immuno-oncology and cellular therapies such as CAR-T cells.</p></sec>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although many patients are cured with standard chemo-immunotherapy, up to 40&#x0025; of DLBCL patients have refractory disease or develop relapse following R-CHOP, or similar regimens, warranting the development of novel, more effective therapeutic strategies for these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME) has emerged as an important predictor of DLBCL outcome in gene expression profiling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Pileri et al. and a few other studies have reported that higher proportion of CD4 T cells, dendritic cells, and myofibroblasts predicted better outcome in DLBCL treated with R-CHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Other studies reported that increased infiltration of CD8 T cells was associated with better outcome in DLBCL(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The role of immune cells such as macrophages and regulatory T cells (T<sub>REG</sub>) is less clear, with contradictory reports in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Despite recent methodological advances to study the TME in cancer, highly multiplexed immunophenotypic characterization of the tumor immune architecture in DLBCL has not been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>
<p>The two major molecular sub-types of DLBCL based on cell of origin (COO) are germinal center B-cell (GCB), originating from B-cells in the light-zone, and activated B-cell (ABC), derived from B-cells which have migrated out of the germinal center and committed to differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Generally, GCB sub-type tends to have better overall survival compared to ABC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The COO classifications were originally performed using gene expression and have found widespread clinical application through immunohistochemistry using the HANS algorithm, which identifies GCB and non-GCB subtypes. Other aggressive sub-types include double-expressor, which overexpress <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>BCL2</italic>, and double-hit lymphoma, which have chromosomal rearrangements of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>BCL2</italic>, or seldomly <italic>BCL6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). DLBCL have been further subset using numerous somatic copy number alterations, structural variants and mutations which stratified DLBCL into four or five genetic subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Chapuy et al. identified five distinct genetic subtypes involving top ranking mutations such as <italic>BCL6</italic> (coordinate genetic signature 1, or C1), <italic>TP53</italic> (C2), <italic>BCL2</italic> (C3), <italic>SGK1</italic> (C4), and <italic>CD79B</italic> (C5). Integration of mutational analysis with functional and spatial parameters derived from DLBCL TME analyses, however, has not yet been reported.</p>
<p>Programmed cell death receptor 1 ligand (PD-L1) is a member of the B7 family that is expressed on tumor cells and has been reported as a predictor of poor survival in multiple epithelial and hematologic malignancies including DLBCL(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling with monoclonal antibodies such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma has resulted in high and durable clinical response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Unlike in Hodgkin lymphoma, the response rate to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in relapsed/refractory DLBCL (R/R DLBCL) has been disappointingly low (&#x2264;10&#x0025;), even though PD-L1 is expressed in a significant subset of DLBCL and is associated with poor prognosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The reasons for this discrepancy between PD-L1 expression and the failure of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibition in R/R DLBCL represent a major knowledge gap in the field.</p>
<p>In this study, we characterize the TME of DLBCL, including the cell types, frequency, functional state and spatial topology using imaging mass cytometry (IMC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Using our previous study of Hodgkin lymphoma, we identify key differences between the Hodgkin lymphoma and DLBCL TME components that might explain their differential responses to immune check point inhibitor (ICI) therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Finally, we perform spatial analysis of the DLBCL tumor architecture to reveal immunologic sub-regions of tumor immune interaction at single cell resolution.</p>

<title>IMC analysis of DLBCL TME identifies heterogeneity of immune infiltration and cellular subtypes</title>
<p>To comprehensively quantify the cellular and spatial heterogeneity in DLBCL, we designed an IMC panel to broadly cover T cells, B cells, Macrophages and structural markers (<xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). We performed IMC on 41 representative tumor samples from 33 cases which were selected from a previously described cohort based on adequacy of residual tissue for analysis (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Our panel of 32 antibodies quantified exhaustion (TIM-3, LAG-3, PD-1) and proliferation (Ki67) states and included markers of immune and endothelial cell lineages. These findings were correlated with clinical features such ascell-of-origin (COO) by IHC HANS criteria, presence of mutations, and responses to chemotherapy (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). In the cohort, 22 (67&#x0025;) of the patients achieved a sustained complete response (CR) to rituximab based chemoimmunotherapy, while 7 (21&#x0025;) were primary refractory or relapsed within one year (REF). Four patients did not receive chemotherapy and were excluded from response to therapy analysis.</p>

<p>IMC produces images similar to immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence with the added advantage of increased multiplex staining. The images were segmented using pixel classification training into single cells yielding on average 16,889 cells per region of interest (ROI), as previously described (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Cellular expression of cell lineage, inducible states, and spatial features were hierarchically clustered with Phenograph to identify major phenotype clusters such as endothelial, regulatory (T<sub>REG</sub>), CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, macrophages, and B cell tumors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Hierarchical meta-clustering across ROIs first identified 14 meta-clusters which were well distributed across cases (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>). The initial meta-clusters were constructed and annotated based on lineage marker expression which identified the broadest categories of the TME phenotypes in DLBCL(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Quality control analysis ensured that cluster annotations were appropriately defined (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">S6</xref>). The major cell components across the 33 cases included 58.2&#x0025; malignant B-cells, 39.5&#x0025; TME, and 2.32&#x0025; endothelial cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Within the TME, we identified 7.70&#x0025; T<sub>REG</sub>, 24.3&#x0025; CD8 T cells, 28.8&#x0025; macrophages and 39.2&#x0025; CD4 T cells. Similar to previous reports, macrophage proportions were 3.96&#x0025; (p=0.069) higher in non-GCB compared to GCB cases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In tumors with low immune infiltration, (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C, 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7</xref>) macrophages were the predominant immune cell type, whereas in cases with greater immune infiltrate CD4&#x002B; cells predominated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1F</xref>). This resulted in a significant negative association between the macrophage and CD4&#x002B; cell proportions (Pearson&#x2019;s R=-0.75, p&#x003C;0.001) across the 33 cases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) as was similarly reported for solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>

<title>Association between cell of origin and abundance of cell phenotypes in DLBCL TME</title>
<p>We next performed sub-classification of each major cell component by including inducible markers and morphological features, which identified the functional states of tumor and immune sub-phenotypes in the TME (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We then associated these TME sub-clusters with IPI, and the five Chapuy genetic subtypes (C1-C5) and cell-of-origin by Hans classification to gain insight into the biological significance of the observed tumor and immune heterogeneity.</p>

<p>Sub-phenotypes were created by re-clustering cells using all markers. Heatmap depicts heterogeneity of clinical predictors, genetic mutation signature and protein expression across all tumor and immune sub-phenotypes. The cluster sizes, strength of association of expression clusters and the cluster proportion of patient &#x2018;high&#x2019; IPI scores greater than 3 portrayed as a cluster percentage. The sub-phenotype log-odds of association to somatic copy number alteration genetic signature classes (C1-C5) are depicted using Bonferroni adjusted significance. Clusters significantly co-expressing cMYC/BCL2 or cMYC/BCL6 (p&#x003C;0.01; mixed-effects ANOVA) were determined as &#x2018;double expressor&#x2019; based on average normalized cellular intensity. Genetic mutations relevant to DLBCL were included as a cluster proportion (&#x0025;) depicted on the right.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="21250775v1_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The CD4 sub-cluster 1, or CD4_1 was associated with genetic subtype C3 and C4. CD4_1 had a 371&#x0025; increase in odds of the genetic subtype C3 for each percent increase in CD4_1 proportion (Bonferroni adj. P&#x003C;0.01) and 97&#x0025; odds increase in C4 (Bonf. adj. P&#x003C;0.01). CD4_1 was enriched for GCB (Chi-square ORGCB=1.29, p=0.013) which was concordant with the C3/C4 coordinate genetic signatures found in primary GCB tumor subtype(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). CD4_1 had the highest PD-1 mean normalized intensity (p&#x003C;0.001) (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8A</xref>). CD4_1 was labeled as the CD45RA<sup>&#x002B;</sup> exhausted phenotype because of its high levels of CD45RA, LAG-3 (p&#x003C;0.001), and TIM-3 (p&#x003C;0.001)(<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). In contrast, CD4_5 was negatively associated with genetic subtype C2 and each percent increase in the CD4_5 reduced the odds of C2 by 78&#x0025; (Bonf. Adj. P=0.02). CD4_5 was significantly associated with non-GCB (ORGCB =0.24, p&#x003C;0.001) and was defined as the CD45RA<sup>&#x2212;</sup> exhausted phenotype due to its low CD45RA intensity (p&#x003C;0.001), and increased expression of LAG-3 (p&#x003C;0.001) and TIM-3 (p&#x003C;0.001). Across patients, CD4 sub-clusters had significant expression variability of CXCR3, CCR4, PD-1, PD-L1, ICOS, Ki67, and VISTA. While the limited numbers of patients in this study prevented formal testing of these markers for predictive value, their heterogeneity across samples makes them intriguing candidate biomarkers.</p>
<p>The M1 macrophage (Macrophage_3, Macrophage_4) phenotype family was not associated with either COO type, whereas the CD206 expressing M2 (Macrophage_1, Macrophage_5, and Macrophage_6) family was enriched with NGCB (ORGCB=0.39, p&#x003C;0.001). When examining the association with genetic subtypes, Macrophage_6 was negatively associated with C3 and C4 with a 71&#x0025; (Bonf. Adj. P=0.02) and 65&#x0025; (Bonf. Adj. P=0.01) relative decrease odds for each percent increase in Macrophage_6, and is consistent with C3/C4 DLBCL being primarily of GCB cell-of-origin.</p>
<p>T<sub>REG</sub>_2 and T<sub>REG</sub>_6 were grouped together as &#x201C;highly suppressive T<sub>REG</sub>&#x201D; because of high expression of CCR4 (p&#x003C;0.001) and ICOS (p=0.02). Highly suppressive T<sub>REG</sub> were marginally represented in NGCB subtypes (ORGCB=0.76, p=0.08). However T<sub>REG</sub>_6 was strongly associated with genetic subtype C1 and for each percent increase in T<sub>REG</sub>_6, the odds of C1 genetic subtype increased 1719&#x0025; (Bonf. Adj. P&#x003C;0.001). In contrast the T<sub>REG</sub>_5 cluster, or Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup>T<sub>REG,</sub> had an activated proliferative phenotype with high Ki67 (p&#x003C;0.001), and was strongly associated with non-GCB (ORGCB=0.47, p&#x003C;0.001). Interestingly, T<sub>REG</sub>_5 was negatively associated with genetic subtypes C1 and C5 with a 99&#x0025; (Bonf. Adj.P=0.02) and 95&#x0025; reduction (Bonf. Adj.P=0.03), respectively, for each percent increase in T<sub>REG</sub>_5, which was unexpected as genetic subtypes C1/C5 are primarily ABC subtype(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). These findings suggest that TME findings may reveal additional heterogeneity not captured by COO or genetic subtypes.</p>
<p>The CD8 sub-clusters had significant variability in activation and exhaustion markers such as TIM-3, PD-1, and LAG-3. CD8_1 and CD8_4 had an Ki67&#x002B; activated phenotype (p&#x003C;0.001) and high PD-1 expression ((p&#x003C;0.001), and were strongly associated with non-GCB (ORGCB =0.48, p&#x003C;0.001) however, the Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD8 phenotype did not have significant associations with the DLBCL genetic subtypes. Although this population was PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, it had low expression of other exhaustion markers consistent with an activated phenotype. In contrast several CD8 clusters demonstrated an exhausted non-proliferative phenotype with co-expression of PD-1, LAG-3 and TIM-3. For example CD8_6 showed a negative association with genetic subtype C3 with a 81&#x0025; reduction (Bonf. Adj. P=0.04), while CD8_5 showed a strong positive association with C3 with an increased 248&#x0025; (Bonf. Adj. P=0.03) for each percent change of the CD8 cluster. While these clusters show similar expression of exhaustion markers, CD8_6 had higher expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR4 compared to CD_5 suggesting differences in chemokine gradients and immune trafficking. CD8_2 also shared a similar exhausted phenotype however it showed a strong enrichment in NGCB tumors (ORGCB =0.42, p&#x003C;0.001). Interestingly this CD8 population had higher pSTAT3 activity comparted to other exhausted sub-types. These results demonstrate marked heterogeneity in the CD8 populations revealed by IMC. Importantly, we show that both activated and exhausted populations expressed PD-1, demonstrating the limitations in using PD-1 as a single marker for exhausted T cells in tissue sections.</p>

<title>Association between chromosomal abnormalities and PD-L1 expression in DLBCL TME</title>
<p>Each patient&#x2019;s chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and we observed that 9p24 copy gains or losses were not associated with tumor abundances (p=0.58, ANOVA) and marginally associated with tumor PD-L1 expression (p=0.21, ANOVA), although this is likely due to the limited sample size as 9p24 copy gains have been previously associated with PD-L1 expression in this cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Although our IMC panel was primary focused on the TME and did not include the markers needed for COO classification by HANS, the immuno-morphological tumor clusters identified by IMC were aligned well with mutational clusters and COO classification.

<title>Association between chemo-responsiveness, tumor phenotypes, and TME</title>
<p>In order to understand how tumor and TME interactions contribute to chemo-responsiveness, we examined the abundance and spatial interactions of tumor and immune cell clusters in relation to clinical response to chemotherapy. To examine changes in the TME we computed a generalized estimating equation model, and for a percent increase in M1-Macrophage case proportion there was a 79.2&#x0025; reduction in the odds of treatment refractory (log-odds=-1.57, Bonferroni adjusted p-value=0.02)(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

(Left) Annotation plot depicts the multivariate generalized linear model which identified M1-macrophages with significantly decreased log-odds for refractory (Bonferroni adjusted p-value&#x003C;0.05), whereas M2-macrophages had marginally increased log-odds for refractory (Bonferroni adjusted p-value&#x003C;0.09).</p>
<p>B. The (left) UMAP projects the structure of each cluster, and adjacent (right) UMAP depicts the enrichment of phenotypes in treatment response.

<p>D. In order to understand chemo-refractoriness at the hyper-local TME level, spatial interactions of immune phenotypes within 2-3 cell diameters (15 &#x00B5;m) of the tumor cells were computed using 1,000 permutations (p&#x003C;0.025). The relative proportions (&#x0025;) of significant spatial interactions of immune phenotypes within the tumor neighborhoods are depicted on the y-axis. Within refractory tumor neighborhoods, PD-L1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>M2 macrophages had increased co-localization compared to tumor neighborhoods in complete responders and CD4 subsets were co-localized with CR.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>We then performed Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) of all samples to visualize distinct clusters of tumor and immune cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, S9A). In particular, we were interested in understanding heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells as this has been previous associated with poor prognosis after chemotherapy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The largest cluster (67.9&#x0025;) of tumor cell was labeled &#x201C;B cell tumor&#x201D; (region b) and was enriched in complete responders and did not express PD-L1. Tumor regions c and a were enriched in refractory patients. Cluster a was identified as Ki67-tumor and had high PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 estimate=&#x002B;0.33, 95&#x0025; CI: (0.22,0.43), p&#x003C;0.001) while cluster c was identified as Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CCR4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> tumor and had low PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 estimate=-0.21, 95&#x0025; CI: (&#x2212;0.32, &#x2212;0.09), p&#x003C;0.001) These data confirm that PD-L1 expression was associated with refractoriness to chemotherapy, but that its expression was limited to a certain sub-population of non-proliferating tumor cells. This finding suggests the interesting possibility that chemoresistance is mediated by a non-proliferating, immune evading subpopulation of tumor cells.</p>
<p>We then examined the TME for markers that associated with chemotherapy response. Comparing refractory to complete responder average intensity, we observed that LAG-3 was increased in REF subjects, specifically in the CD45RA<sup>&#x2212;</sup> CD4 exhausted phenotype (LAG-3 difference estimate=0.58, 95&#x0025; CI: (0.18, 0.98), p=0.10) and significantly increased in highly suppressive T<sub>REG</sub> (LAG-3 difference estimate=0.72, 95&#x0025; CI: (0.32, 1.13),p=9.1e-03) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Additionally, both phenotype case proportions did not differ between REF to CR, although LAG-3 expression was enriched in REF subjects (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">S9 B</xref>) and is consistent with a recent report on LAG-3 expression in DLBCL(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).</p>
<p>Immune cells in the TME can mediate chemoresistance through direct interaction with tumor cells or indirectly through interactions with other immune cells. Therefore, we sought to characterize the hyper-local microenvironment within 2-3 cell diameters (15&#x00B5;m) of REF enriched tumor cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) by measuring its attraction of immune cell types. Attraction between cell types was defined as an observation of two cell types in closer proximity in the measured tissue than in randomly simulated tissue comprised of the same cell proportions (p&#x003C;0.025). Comparing the tumor neighborhoods across treatment response, the REF tumor neighborhoods had significantly increased attractions with PD-L1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>M2 macrophages (p=0.04831, t-test), however highly suppressive T<sub>REG</sub>, which were highly associated with REF at the case level, showed no significant enrichments in the hyper-local TME (p=0.74, t-test). In contrast, the hyper-local tumor neighborhoods associated with CR had uniformly increased CD4 phenotypes within the tumor environment compared to REF (p&#x003C;0.05, t-test).</p>

<title>Cross-cohort analysis shows differences in proportion and functional states of immune cell subsets between DLBCL and Hodgkin lymphoma</title>
<p>For patients who fail chemotherapy, treatment with antibodies against the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint have elicited clinical response rates close to 90&#x0025; in patients with HL, while responses in patients with DLBCL are less than 10&#x0025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that comparing the TME between reactive lymph nodes, HL, and DLBCL might reveal the basis for the difference in clinical responses to checkpoint inhibitors. We previously reported our analysis of the TME in 5 reactive lymph nodes and 22 cases of HL using a 36 marker IMC panel, of which 21 markers overlapped with the IMC DLBCL panel (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Figure S10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). We integrated the TME analysis from both diseases after sub-setting each experiment to include only CD4, CD8, MAC, and T<sub>REG</sub> cells, and identified the joint TME phenotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>C. Comparing relative immune proportions between DLBCL and HL shows that CD4 T cells (&#x0025; difference=-10.2, 95&#x0025; CI:(&#x2212;16.2,-4.2)) and T<sub>REG</sub> (&#x0025; difference=-8.5, 95&#x0025; CI:(&#x2212;11.9,-5.02)) are significantly enriched in HL, while macrophages (&#x0025; difference=22.1, 95&#x0025; CI:(14.9,29.2)) are significantly enriched in DLBCL.

<p>D. Analyses of cell-state protein expression on each immune subset across the two cohorts show differences in functional states of immune subsets in DLBCL compared to HL. PD-L1 expression on macrophages is significantly higher in HL compared to DLBCL, whereas PD-1 expression is higher on CD8 and T<sub>REG</sub> in DLBCL compared to HL. TIM-3 expression is significantly higher in DLBCL and is predominantly on CD4 and CD8 T cells.</p></caption>

We quantitatively tested the level of inter-mixing between the two experiments using the K-nearest neighbor batch effect test and confirmed that the joint panel expression intensities on the TME were homogeneous in their expression (CD4 p=0.31, CD8 p=0.49, MAC p=0.43, T<sub>REG</sub> p=0.08) (<xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Figure S11</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparing the TME phenotypes identified in DLBCL and HL, macrophages significantly increased by 24&#x0025; in DLBCL compared to reactive lymph nodes (RLN) compared to the difference between HL and RLN (p&#x003C;0.001) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), but within the respective HL/DLBCL populations of macrophages, global PD-L1 expression was lower in DLBCL (logFC= &#x2212;0.26, BH q-value=7.35e-14) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS14">S14A</xref>).

<p>Within macrophages, the relative proportion of TIM-3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>PD-L1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> macrophage phenotypes were similar in both HL and DLBCL (Log-odds= &#x2212;0.61, p=0.88), however the relative proportion of TIM-3 mid PD-L1 mid macrophages had the highest enrichment in DLBCL compared to HL (Log-odds=65, p&#x003C;0.001), followed by TIM-3-PD-L1-macrophages (log-odds=2.1, p&#x003C;0.001). CD4 cells were more abundant in HL compared to DLBCL, but the subset of TIM-3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>T cells was increased in DLBCL (logFC=0.46, BH q-value&#x003C;0.001) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>).

<title>Spatial analyses reveal differences in tumor topology between GCB and non-GCB</title>
<p>The histopathology of DLBCL is predominantly characterized by large sheets of tumor cells without a distinct structure, however closer inspection reveals heterogeneity in the tumor cell and TME architecture. In order to characterize the single-cell topology we developed an algorithm for tumor cell-TME distance classification and tested it using synthetic images and B cells in normal lymph nodes. The distance classification algorithm we developed classifies a selected population into sub-clusters based on distances to neighboring cell types (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We constructed a demonstration set of four synthetic point patterns which simulated a lymph node (<xref rid="figS14" ref-type="fig">Figures S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS15">S15</xref>) and successfully classified a point pattern in terms of the nearest neighbor distance (NND) to the other synthetic types. Next, we classified B cells in a normal lymph node based on their distance relationship to other cells. The topology analysis identified B cell spatial clusters that corresponded to regions in the light and dark zone of germinal centers, the mantle zone of the follicle, and T cell rich paracortex regions (<xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">Figures S15A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS15">S15C</xref>).</p>

The metric is calculated for each cell by locating the 5 nearest cells belonging to the immune TME, locating the centroid of those nearest neighbors, and measuring the distance from the centroid to the original cell. A smaller distance metric indicates that a cell is embedded within the immune TME, a longer distance denotes exclusion of tumor cells from immune cells.</p>
<p>B. Nine classes of tumor topology were identified and were well distributed across cases, ordered from immune-cold to immune-hot. Intra-tumor spatial heterogeneity is depicted in a representative annotated image from case 26. The first inset shows tumor classes that are more intermixed with the immune cells.

Clark-Evans aggregation index quantifies the level of spatial regularity (index&#x003E;1), or clustering (index&#x003C;1), and was applied to the B-cell topology classes in reactive lymph node (RLN) and DLBCL (GCB and NGCB). The Clark-Evans index (box plots) indicated the B-cell topology classes in non-GCB cases were significantly more clustered compared to RLN (Tukey p=0.03), whereas GCB had spatial regularity similar to RLN (Tukey p=0.47). There was marginal difference comparing GCB to NGCB (Tukey p=0.058).

</fig>
<p>Having validated the tumor-TME distance clustering approach on synthetic images and normal lymph node, we applied our distance classification algorithm to the tumor cells in DLBCL and identified nine spatial clusters, or tumor neighborhoods, based on tumor distance to the TME. The rarest topology was class &#x201C;a&#x201D;, or &#x201C;tumor_a&#x201D;, (0.93&#x0025; prevalent), whereas tumor_f (21.1&#x0025;), tumor_d (15.3&#x0025;) and tumor_c (15.2&#x0025;) were most common (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The topology classes had significant heterogeneity across the immune proportions (p=0.01507; ANOVA) which is not unexpected since abundance of immune cells impacts their distance to tumor cells in a given tissue. From visual inspection it was clear that some tumor cells were dispersed among immune cells such as tumor_b and tumor_e (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, inset 1), while other tumor cells formed tight layered clusters such as tumor_d, tumor_f, and tumor_i (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, inset 2)</p>
<p>Considering that tumors are three-dimensional, we grouped the nine tumor spatial clusters into four groups inspired by the geologic structure of Earth: core, mantle, crust and dispersed. Tumor_d (average centroid distance to immune (dist)= 47.9&#x00B5;m) was defined as the tumor &#x201C;core&#x201D; because it was characterized by the furthest distance to the tumor-immune interface. Tumor_f (dist= 30.9&#x00B5;m) followed by tumor_i (dist= 24.1&#x00B5;m) were the next clusters in order of distance to tumor-immune interface and were defined as the tumor &#x201C;mantle&#x201D; because they were consistently adjacent to the core (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, inset 2). Tumor_c (dist= 18.9&#x00B5;m) and tumor_h (dist= 18.9&#x00B5;m) represented the boundary to the tumor-immune interface, or &#x201C;crust&#x201D; because it was adjacent to both the TME interface and mantle/core regions. Tumor_g (dist= 13.8&#x00B5;m), tumor_e (dist= 13.7&#x00B5;m) tumor_a (dist= 13.2&#x00B5;m), and tumor_b (dist= 12.2&#x00B5;m) had the shortest distances to the TME and formed unorganized tumor clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, inset 1). Hence, we defined these scattered cells as &#x201C;dispersed&#x201D; regions of the tumor. Using this conceptual framework, we were able to spatially organize and interpret the tumor spatial clusters in terms of proximity to the TME.</p>
<p>The nine tumor spatial clusters were tested for association with COO using a multivariate logistic regression model. After adjusting for IPI, tumor_e (p=0.026), was significantly associated with non-GCB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D</xref>, <xref rid="figS16" ref-type="fig">Figure S16A</xref>). Tumor_e represented scattered tumor cells in regions rich with lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, inset 1). Tumor_c, found at the tumor immune interface was marginally associated (log-odds=0.46, p=0.08) with non-GCB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, inset 2). These results are consistent with non-GCB tumors having increased interactions with immune cells.</p>
<p>To further explore if COO was associated with differences in tumor topology, we quantified the level of spatial clustering across each case, using the Clark-Evans aggregation index. The Clark-Evans aggregation index has been used in fluorescence microscopy studies and geographical research as a measure of spatial organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Here, we used the standardized Clark-Evans index to compare the B cells in normal lymph node to the malignant B cells in GCB and non-GCB cases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E-F</xref>). The malignant B cells in GCB patients had similar spatial ordering to that of B cells in RLN (Tukey adjusted p-value=0.47), whereas the malignant B cells in non-GCB had significantly different spatial organization (Tukey adjusted p-value=0.03). Comparing GCB to non-GCB, there was marginal difference in their spatial distribution (Tukey adjusted p-value =0.058). Further, as the spatial patterns of tumor cells become less clustered, the risk of dying decreased (Cox hazard estimate=-1.89, 95&#x0025; CI: (&#x2212;4.52, 0.75)). Increasing architectural disorganization is routinely recognized in carcinoma as a feature of tumor aggressiveness but is not routinely described in DLBCL histopathology. Our results quantify this feature and demonstrate that decreasing spatial regularity in DLBCL architecture correlates with both COO and survival.</p>
<p>We next explored whether different immune subsets had differential interactions with the tumor spatial clusters. For each of the major immune classes we determined significant spatial attractions or repulsions towards each tumor spatial cluster (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). We observed that CD4 T cells had significant associations within the tumor mantle/core compared to the crust/dispersed regions (OR=6.38, 95&#x0025; CI: (2.91,14.43), Fisher&#x2019;s exact p value=3.9e-06). This suggests that CD4 T cells were more likely to penetrate into tumor regions furthest from the TME interface. Whereas, the CD8 T cells had decreased association with mantle/core compared to the crust/dispersed (OR=0.16, 95&#x0025; CI: (0.05,0.41), Fisher&#x2019;s exact p value=5.6e-05), which suggests that CD8 are restricted to outer regions of the tumor cell-immune interface.</p>
<p>Macrophages were able to partially penetrate into the mantle areas but were depleted from deeper core areas (tumor_d) and had marginal decreased association at the tumor mantle/core compared to the crust/dispersed (OR=0.21, 95&#x0025; CI: (8.5e-03, 1.1), Fisher&#x2019;s exact p value=0.12). Encouraged by these preliminary results, we next sought to comprehensively characterize the immune cells in each tumor zone.</p>

<title>DLBCL comprehensive spatial interactions between TME and tumor topology, functional state profile, mutations, and patient clinical association</title>
<p>To comprehensively characterize the topology of tumor immune interaction, we adapted a previously described method for examining spatial interaction in IMC data to look for spatial interactions between tumor spatial clusters and immune phenotype sub-clusters within a 15&#x00B5;m interaction zone(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> summarizes the spatial interactions between immune phenotypes and tumor spatial clusters, the protein expressions on each cluster, as well as their multivariate association (IPI adjusted) with genetic mutations and Hans COO. For example, tumor_e, which was enriched in C4 DLBCL genetic subtype (p&#x003C;0.05) subtype and was classified as a dispersed tumor type, had enriched interactions with activated and exhausted CD8 T cells, and Memory CD4 T cells. Tumor_c, found at the tumor immune interface, showed significant negative association with C2 (p&#x003C;0.05), and was not associated with the C5 genetic subtype, and was significantly associated with participants having CD79b mutation (Benjamini-Hochberg adj. P-value=0.02). Tumor_c was enriched for interactions with Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup> memory CD4, TIM-3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>LAG-3<sup>&#x002B;</sup> exhausted CD8 T cells, and highly suppressive T<sub>REG</sub>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Tumor_f, found in the inner mantle was enriched for endothelial cells, and depleted for CD8 subsets. This region was enriched for both highly suppressive T<sub>REG</sub> as well as M1-macrophages and this heterogeneity may reflect the trafficking of immune cells from the peripheral blood. Tumor_d, which defined the core regions, contained a sparse TME neighborhood with depletion of most immune subsets with the exception of occasional CXCR3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD45RA<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD4 and highly suppressive T<sub>REG</sub> cells. Tumor_d regions were significantly associated with the C4 genetic subtype (p&#x003C;0.05) and were not associated with refractoriness to chemotherapy, however the presence of these pockets of immune deserts may explain the lack of efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in DLBCL and could have implications for cellular therapies such as CAR-T cells. While penetrating CD4 cells were overall rare, there was a moderate correspondence between CD4 and CXCR3 co-expression, and the total number of significant spatial interactions with the tumor core (p=0.12, R<sup>2</sup>=0.69, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This suggests that CXCR3 plays a role in granting CD4 cells entry into otherwise restricted tumor sites and suggests a possible target for enhancing immune cell penetration into the tumor core regions.</p>
<p>To summarize our findings, we grouped the nine tumor spatial clusters into three zones: dispersed (tumor_b, tumor_a, tumor_e, and tumor_g), crust/mantle (tumor_c, tumor_h, tumor_f, and tumor_i) and core (tumor_d) and examined the immune cells surrounding tumor cells in each zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The dispersed zone showed enrichment for proliferative subsets of CD8, macrophage, and T<sub>REG</sub> surrounding tumor cells, which was consistent with high immune activity. The mantle/crust zone was most notable for enrichment of exhausted CD8 and highly suppressive T<sub>REG</sub> around tumor cells suggesting a zone of immune suppression. The core region was depleted for most immune phenotypes consistent with an immune desert. These three zones of immune activation, immune suppression, and immune desert corresponded to the tumor spatial zones of dispersed, mantle/crust and core, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). On to this topology we overlaid COO and mutation status. Finally, by creating an ordered topology from high to low immune density we were able to identify CXCR3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD4 cells as having the most tumor penetrating properties.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this highly multiplexed single-cell study of the tumor immune architecture in DLBCL, we have quantified the intra-tumor heterogeneity of B cell lymphoma architecture and identified immune phenotypes that correlate with COO, tumor mutations, and response to therapy. A similar effort in breast cancer was recently reported, however this is the first such report in lymphoma where the high cellular density and the co-expression of markers on tumor and immune cells make this type of study particularly challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>Within DLBCL, a recent large-scale multiplexed study with a focus on the role of PD-L1 and PD-1 on CD20<sup>&#x002B;</sup> DLBCL cells was performed using immunofluorescence, but that study was limited to 13 markers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In that study, Xu-Monette et al. identified that PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD8 cells were associated with poorer overall survival. PD-1 expression on CD4 also showed adverse prognosis on univariate analysis at low cut offs, but a paradoxical better prognosis when a high level cutoff for PD-1 expression was used. These results suggest that there may be sub-populations within the PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD4 population that have differential effects on survival. Indeed, in our study we observed that CD4 and CD8 T cells with PD-1 expression could be further divided into activated Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup>T cells and terminally exhausted PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>TIM-3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>LAG-3<sup>&#x002B;</sup> triple positive T cells, highlighting the importance of highly multiplexed analysis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we demonstrated that subgroups enriched in refractory patients showed higher PD-L1 and PD-1 levels compared to CR, which is consistent with previous results. PD-1/PD-L1 expression differences are possibly coupled to spatial expression patterns. The co-localization of PD-L1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>M2 macrophages with tumor suggests that these cells mediate chemoresistance through direct interactions with tumor cells, while highly immunosuppressive T<sub>REG</sub>, which are common in REF patients but not tumor-adjacent, exert their effects primarily through interactions with other immune cells. The ranges of influence that immune cells in the TME can have in modulating chemoresistance of malignant B cells is a topic for future studies.</p>
<p>Our multivariate analysis of tumor spatial clusters identified that exhausted CD8 T cells were excluded from tumor dense mantle and core regions while selected PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD4 T cells were better able to access the tumor core regions. This arrangement is somewhat reminiscent of the architecture of a germinal center with CD8 T cells relegated to the surrounding T cell zone and T follicular helper cells (PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD4) interacting with proliferating B cells in the center. In contrast to the normal GC, however, we also saw T<sub>REG</sub> cells penetrating the tumor core regions which could provide an alternative explanation for the lack of infiltrating CD8 cells. Loss of MHC Class I expression has been previously reported in DLBCL (49&#x0025;-61&#x0025;) and could also contribute to a lack of CD8 T cell engagement with the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>).</p>
<p>Our observation that tumor core areas, which exclude immune cells, are found in most DLBCL cases may have important implications for clinical failure of ICI therapies and resistance to cellular therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Among the CD4 cells, we observed that CXCR3-high subsets, while rare, had infiltrating potential in lymphoma, similar to previous reports in other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Importantly, Xu-Monette et al. reported that up-regulation of <italic>CXCL9</italic>, a ligand for CXCR3, was found in DLBCL with higher T cell infiltration, further supporting the role of CXCR3 in T cell homing to tumor core regions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). We hypothesize that activating CXCR3 or enforcing expression of CXCR3 on CAR-T might improve immune cell penetration into lymphoma core regions. Applications of IMC analysis on treatment biopsies after CAR-T therapy could be particularly helpful to understanding treatment response and failure in this context.</p>
<p>Given the clinical failure of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in DLBCL, identifying novel immuno-oncology targets for DLBCL remains critically important. DLBCL checkpoint therapy non-responsiveness can be further understood by investigating alternative check point molecules beyond PD-1/PD-L1 such as TIM-3, LAG3, and/or VISTA. Interestingly, DLBCL had higher levels of PD-1 on T cells compared to HL, an observation that is consistent with PD-1 being a poor biomarker of checkpoint response. Additionally, the comparison between DLBCL to HL identified TIM-3 as over-expressed primarily in CD4 and CD8 T cells which highlights it as a therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Furthermore, PD-1 was enriched in T<sub>REG</sub> in DLBCL, whereas TIM-3 on T<sub>REG</sub> was not, which demonstrates the importance of identifying therapeutic targets that are differentially enriched on specific CD4/CD8 immune subsets. Given the high level of PD-1 on T<sub>REG</sub> that we observed, anti-PD-1 antibodies may have led to increased activity of T<sub>REG</sub> resulting in paradoxical suppression of immune response after check point therapy and clinical failure. These observations demonstrate that comparisons of TME between ICI responsive and non-responsive sub-types of lymphoma can suggest potential mechanisms of ICI sensitivity and resistance.</p>
<p>In order to perform our comparisons between DLBCL and Hodgkin lymphoma, we integrated IMC data from experiments performed using different antibody panels. The increased dynamic range of signal with IMC, compared to IHC, creates challenges with increased variability in signal intensity across experiments. Here, using approaches to normalize and standardize the data, we were able to demonstrate meaningful comparisons between different data sets. There were limitations to this method, however, and even after data integration several markers had to be excluded because of poor normalization. As additional studies using imaging mass cytometry or other similar high multiplexed single cell imaging techniques are published, methods to measure uncertainty across experimental procedures will need to be developed.</p>
<p>One potential limitation of our study is that we only examine a relatively small part of the tumor area (approximately 1mm<sup>2</sup>) and may not have captured biologically relevant heterogeneity outside the region of interest. However, within that small area, we are able to discern a high degree of spatial and functional heterogeneity and describe a complex tissue architecture of immune response and suppression that corresponds to clinical feature. Optimal sample size will also depend on the specific tumor type and will need to be determined empirically. In our data, seven cases had at least one duplicate core on the TMA. Analysis by PCA suggested that most duplicates clustered together (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>). This would suggest that small sample areas may be adequate to understand the complexity of tumor immune responses, at least in DLBCL. This is important because on-treatment and progression biopsies, which are critical to understand the kinetics of immune response and failure of immune-oncology agents, are often obtained as core needle biopsies, which are much smaller than diagnostic tissue samples.</p>
<p>Another limitation of these data is that we only study diagnostic samples of patients prior to chemotherapy and not prior to treatment with immune-oncology agents. Since DLBCL responses to ICI are rare, we compared the TME in DLBCL to Hodgkin&#x2019;s lymphoma, where most patients achieve clinical responses. However, there are many differences between HL and DLBCL that could also account for the difference in TME, and the agreement between the response to ICI in these two tumor types and our observations would need to be experimentally verified. Further validation of additional patient data using IMC would reinforce these findings and determine if the results reported in this study that lie at the border of significance are truly significant.</p>
<p>Finally, the multiplex analysis provided by IMC could help guide the next generation of combination ICI therapies, including newer agents targeting CCR4, LAG-3, and TIM-3, or novel cellular therapies and bi-specific antibodies currently in development for lymphoma. Combining IMC with multi-omics profiling of pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies will be powerful translational tools for understanding mechanisms of resistance and clinical failure for ICI and cellular therapies. In summary, IMC analysis of lymphoma reveals phenotypic and spatial structure in the TME that gives new insights to tumor immunology.</p>

<title>SUBJECT DETAILS</title>
<p>This retrospective study included a subset of 33 patients from a previously studied cohort of 85 patients diagnosed with de novo DLBCL at Los Angeles County and University of Southern California (USC) Medical Centers between 2002 and 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The sub cohort was representative of the primary cohort and was not selected other than looking for samples with adequate remaining tissues for further analyses (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>).

<title>Tissue Microarray and Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Three of the six tissue microarray (TMA) blocks from the parent cohort with sufficient remaining tissues representative of viable tumor were obtained from the Pathology archive of Los Angeles County and USC Medical Centers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed on 4-&#x03BC;m tissue sections using DAKO ready-to-use antibodies with the EnVision FLEX and FLEX&#x002B; visualization systems (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) on an automated immunostainer (Autostainer Link 48, DAKO). Detailed IHC staining protocol and scoring methods have previously been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). TMA cores were 2mm in diameter.</p>

<sec id="s5b">
<title>Imaging Mass Cytometry staining</title>
<p>Three of the six TMAs with optimal quality of remaining tumor tissues from the larger cohort study were selected for this study. The TMAs contained 42 cores of FFPE DLBCL tissues from 33 patients and 2 cores from liver tissues. FFPE sections of 4-&#x00B5;m were baked at 60&#x00B0;C for 90 minutes on a hot plate, de-waxed for 20 minutes in xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of alcohol (100&#x0025;, 95&#x0025;, 80&#x0025; and 70&#x0025;) for 5 minutes each. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was conducted on a hot plate at 95&#x00B0;C in Tris-EDTA buffer at pH 9 for 30 minutes. After blocking with 3&#x0025; BSA in PBS for 45 minutes, the sections were incubated overnight at 4&#x00B0;C with a cocktail of 32 antibodies tagged with rare lanthanide isotopes obtained from Fluidigm (<xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Titration for PD-1 antibody was performed on tonsil tissue (follicular T helper cells in the germinal center). PD-L1 titration was done on a commercial slide containing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cell pallets of HDLM-2 (PD-L1&#x002B;) and PC-3 (PD-L1-) cell lines from Cell Signaling Technology (Key resources table). Validation and titration of all other markers were done on control tonsil tissue (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). HLA-DR, pSTAT3, PD-L2 and Ephrin-B2 antibodies showed unspecific staining patterns in the control tonsil tissue and therefore were excluded from analyses.</p>

<title>Tissue imaging and ablation</title>
<p>All cores were evaluated by two pathologists (I.S. and M.H.) to identify region of interest (ROI) on H&#x0026;E. Slides were analyzed using the Fluidigm Hyperion Tissue Imager system that couples laser ablation with mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Laser beam of 1-&#x00B5;m<sup>2</sup> spot size was used to ablate tissue area of 1000-&#x00B5;m<sup>2</sup> per core at a frequency of 200 Hz. The metal isotopes were simultaneously measured and indexed against the location of each spot to generate intensities and digital spatial maps of the ablated tissues. Detailed descriptions of the ablation techniques have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>).</p>

<p>The presented data used normalization such as the hyperbolic-arc-sine transformation, and Min/Max normalization at the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). The authors for Phenograph and t-SNE recommended using the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile to clip the data to [0,1] scale and remove outliers, which we followed. For the cluster expression estimates, and spatial expression heterogeneity modeling, we used the mixed-effects linear model with the single-cell marker expression intensities scaled to a standard normal distribution across each ROI. Thus, for linear modeling we ensure that for all tissues, each marker expression was on the standardized Gaussian distribution. For Cox proportional hazards estimates, the relative proportions of each cluster were used as features, with survival times (N=30, events=7) in univariate models.</p>

<title>Phenotypic clustering</title>
<p>The images along with the masks were imported into histoCAT software for initial evaluation. Cell features were extracted and imported into R statistical software environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). We hierarchically performed meta-clustering to identify cell &#x201C;phenotypes&#x201D;. The first step under-clustered the data using lineage related markers (BCL2, BCL6, CD20, CD206, CD3, CD30, CD31, CD4, CD45RA/RO, CD68, CD8, EphrinB2, FOXP3 and HLADR) clustering each ROI (nearest neighbor, k<sub>1</sub>=45) and then clustering on the centroids (nearest neighbor, k<sub>2</sub>=15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). The major cell classification per case identified 14 meta-clusters, and each ROI had on average 1,145.174 cells per meta-cluster. Quality control analysis performed Phenograph (k=50) on each major cell component separately to ensure that the major cell expression was homogeneous on the corresponding marker. Re-assignments of CD4 comprised of 1.54&#x0025;, the initial tumor component reassigned 6.21&#x0025; to CD8, CD4, MAC, and endothelial classes. Following the re-assignments, we identified minor clusters for each major cell component by re-performing meta-clustering (k<sub>1</sub>=45, k<sub>2</sub>=15) on each TME component separately, with the inclusion of inducible state markers (cMYC, CCR4, CXCR3, Granzyme, ICOS, Ki67, LAG-3, PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, TBET, TIM-3, Vimentin, VISTA, and pSTAT3) and morphological features (Area, eccentricity, solidity, perimeter, percent touching, number of neighbors).</p>

<title>TMA and replicate divergence analysis</title>
<p>The cohort comprised of 3 TMAs, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the presence of batch effects across TMAs. After annotating the 14 meta-clusters into major cell components, we performed PCA on the relative proportions per ROI and the PCA showed well-mixed visual representation of the variability of the data that did not have any TMA specific grouping. Case 17, 18, 21, 26, 27 and 31 had replicate ROIs taken and case 30 had triplicate ROIs. Using the R package &#x2018;entropy (v.1.2.1)&#x2019;, we computed the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence using a given replicate ROI relative frequencies per major cell component and compared a given replicate to the case relative average of the major components. The KL divergence scores per ROI were all below 0.10, however Case 26 had increased ROI heterogeneity (KL divergence of 0.26). The PCA analysis of the replicates showed minimal distance separations with the exception of Case 26. The replicates were mostly similar, with the exception of Case 26, and for the analysis of patient clinical variables we used the case averages across the ROIs.</p>

The heatmap visualization standardized each ROI to a standard normal distribution. The heatmap depicts the mean normalized intensities, which ensures that the tissues were standardized. The clustering of all the phenotypes present used bootstrapping (100) using &#x2018;pvclust (v.2.2.0)&#x2019; and hierarchically clustered using sub-cluster means (Euclidean distance, Ward&#x2019;s method) &#x2018;dendsort (v.0.3.3)&#x2019; R package.</p>

<title>Clinical association of sub-clusters to COO and mutation</title>
<p>In order to test and measure the odds ratio between sub-clusters and HANS cell of origin classification of GCB and NGBC, we constructed a 2&#x00D7;2 contingency table at the patient/case level. The relative proportions of a given sub-cluster present/absent in each patient stratified on the HANS classification formed the 2&#x00D7;2 contingency table. The simple non-parametric odds ratio of association between the sub-clusters and HANS are depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and the p-values used the Pearson&#x2019;s Chi-square test of association. The HANS odds ratio depicted if the OR is greater than 1, or less than 0.90 with p&#x003C;0.01. The odds ratio indicates the strength of association between a given cluster and GCB/NGBC classification.</p>
<p>The international prognostic index scores [0-5] were measured, and a median cutoff (&#x003E;3) was used to identify patients with high IPI scores. For each sub-cluster the relative proportion of high IPI patients were computed providing a simple proportion of the relative proportion of high IPI subjects present within a sub-cluster.</p>
<p>BCL2 and MYC protein were measured by immune-histochemistry. BCL2 overexpression was measured using a 40&#x0025; cutoff judged by IHC, and MYC over expression was determined as 70&#x0025; threshold. Patients classified as double expressors were identified as BCL2 above the 40&#x0025; and MYC above the 70&#x0025; threshold. A mixed-effect linear regression model was used to identify significantly above average expression of cMYC and BCL2 or cMYC and BCL6 (&#x03B1;-level =0.05). Each phenotype subset was compared with the average expression for the corresponding major phenotype and significantly above average expression of cMYC and BCL2 or cMYC and BCL6 were tested (&#x03B1;-level =0.05). r. Tumor_6 (), Tumor_5 had significantly higher than average co-expression with p&#x003C;0.01. The R package &#x2018;lme4&#x2019; (version 1.1.23) was used for the mixed-effects model.</p>

<title>Phenotype association with mutation signatures</title>

<title>Estimation of driver proteins on sub-cluster</title>
<p>We avoided calling a sub-cluster immune subset &#x201C;positive&#x201D; or &#x201C;negative&#x201D; by arbitrary thresholding but used a linear mixed-effects model to derive effect estimates of markers across all sub-clusters. We constructed the linear model using the ROI standardized single-cell expression by mapping all cells per ROI to a standard normal distribution. Hence all ROIs had standardized marker intensity, and for generalizability all estimates excluded non-treated subjects or subjects lost-to-follow-up. We provided point estimates using complete data only. The point estimates and 95&#x0025; confidence intervals on key markers were derived using (&#x2018;lme4 (v.1.1.21)&#x2019;, and &#x2018;multcomp (v.1.4.12)&#x2019; R packages). The point estimates for &#x201C;driver&#x201D;, or protein enrichments, on sub-clusters were performed using mixed-effects linear model which treated the case as a random effect, and the sub-cluster mean expression per ROI as the features. We created custom contrasts for all sub-cluster average expression and tested for enrichment by comparing to the global mean for that protein in a single model. The significance of a particular sub-cluster is interpreted as significantly higher/lower to the grand average of that protein (p&#x003C;0.05), which determined &#x201C;&#x002B;/-&#x201D; for that cluster. The confidence intervals were generated using general linear hypothesis test (&#x2018;glht&#x2019;) function from the R package &#x2018;multcomp (v.1.4.12)&#x2019; and derived from ROI standardized values which we hope increases reproducibility in this field.</p>

<title>Sub-Cluster association with chemotherapy response and refractoriness</title>
<p>The Barnes-Hut t-stochastic neighborhood embedding (tSNE) was constructed using (&#x2018;Rtsne (v.0.15)&#x2019; Package), and UMAP (umap v0.2.2.1) were used. After performing the UMAP using all single-cells, manual annotations of the sub-clusters were performed by visual inspection. The tSNE parameters were initial dimensions: 50, perplexity : 30, theta: 15. In order to compare enriched/depleted immune subsets, the case proportions for each sub-cluster were derived (&#x0025;), as well as the standard error of the mean 95&#x0025; confidence interval (N=33) by averaging ROIs at the case level. The p-values for proportion enrichment were computed using simple linear regression (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>).

<title>Cross-cohort analysis of DLBCL and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)</title>
<p>To compare the TME in both diseases, we subset both experiments to include only CD4, CD8, Macrophages, and TREGs, and omitted all other phenotypes present in either experiment. The TME expression of integrated data including both DLBCL and HL identified primary phenotypes in the TME in both diseases. The HL data was obtained from our recent publication in Hodgkin&#x2019;s lymphoma that included 5 lymph nodes, 22 cases of HL (1 lymphocyte rich, 9 mixed cellularity, and 12 nodular sclerosis subtypes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). This experiment was performed with a 36 panel list, of which 21 overlapped with the DLBCL experiment (CCR4, CD206, CD20, CD30, CD3, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD4, CD68, CD8, CXCR3, EphrinB2, FOXP3, HLADR, ICOS, Ki67, LAG3, PD-1, PD-L1, TIM-3, and TBET). The meta-clustering (k<sub>1</sub>=45, k<sub>2</sub>=15) process identified 17 HL meta-clusters using Min/Max normalization as recommended by original authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). To compare the TME expression in the 75 ROIs from both diseases, we subset both experiments to include only CD4, CD8, macrophages, and TREGs. Prior data integration, we first selected markers that had minimal differences per ROI across by visual inspection of the ROI interquartile ranges across both diseases. Markers such as CD4, CD8, CD68, FOXP3, CD206, DNA, PD-L1, PD-1, TIM-3, CCR4, CXCR3, ICOS, Ki67, and cell area were selected because they indicated similar inter-quartile ranges and most constant means across experiments. To integrate the single-cell data, we first standardized the expression to-standard normal, and then used &#x2018;limma (v.3.40.2)&#x2019; to fit an empirical Bayes linear model and regress out the batch effects related to the 2 experiments at the single-cell level (&#x2018;sva&#x2019; (v.3.32.1) package). To evaluate the batch effects, we used DNA, and the area of the cell objects as a positive control because we should expect that DNA content, and immune cell areas should be very similar across experiments. After data integration, we observed consistent area sizes across experiments and DNA expression. In contrast, LAG-3 failed to integrate and had dissimilar dynamic range. and was excluded. PCA, at both the case level and single cell level, along with uniform manifold mapping (uMAP) at the single cell level were performed to visually inspect the presence of batch across diseases.</p>
<p>After selecting markers and performing integration, we used the k-nearest neighbor batch-effect correction test (&#x2018;kBET&#x2019; R package (v.0.99.6)) to quantitatively measure the batch effect. This test is a metric to measure the quality of the batch correction and performs a Pearson&#x2019;s &#x03C7;<sup>2</sup> test comparing a randomly sampled subset to measure the association to the levels of batch covariates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). The Pearson&#x2019;s &#x03C7;<sup>2</sup> assumes that the data are inter-mixed, and the kBET returns a metric of the average rejection rate of the null hypothesis across the iterations (number of iterations= 100) of sampling. Hence a low kBET score, corresponds with a low rejection of the null hypothesis in the &#x03C7;<sup>2</sup> test which assumes that the data are well inter-mixed. Therefore low kBET scores corresponds with low batch effects. The kBET scores across all phenotypes yielded 0.2422 score, and CD4 had the lowest kBET score (kBET=0.1484, p-value=0.31), whereas TREGs had the highest batch effect score (kBET=0.37, p=0.08). Note that we tested for batch on each TME component separately and did not adjust the p-values for multiple test corrections. The input for the kBET metric where the 75 unique ROIs across both experiments (rows) and the columns were the Z-transformed selected protein measures previously described.</p>
<p>We examined the explained variance of the selected integrated expression markers by the phenotype levels (CD4, CD8, MAC, TREG), or the disease type (HL or DLBCL). For a well-integrated experiment, the integrated expression should have a low explained variance associated with disease type. We performed a Two-Way ANOVA regressing the protein expression onto categorical features such as phenotypes (4 levels) or disease type (2 levels). For PD-1, we observed that the phenotype categorical variable was a significant explanatory variable (F-statistic=15.38, p-value=0.025), whereas the experimental factor was not (F-statistic=1.32, p-value= 0.33). Similarly, PD-L1 the phenotype categorical variable was a marginal explanatory variable (F-statistic=4.56, p-value=0.12), whereas the experiment feature was not (F-statistic=0.02, p-value=0.88). For TIM-3, the phenotype feature explained more of the variability of TIM-3 (F-statistic=2.73, p-value=0.22) compared to the experimental factor (F-statistic=0.06, p-value=0.82). The ANOVA indicated that the average expression had more association with the variability across phenotypes levels as opposed to experimental /disease type.</p>
<p>In order to compare proportions of the TME across disease types, the case relative proportions(&#x0025;) were tested using simple linear regression, and the p-values were multiplied by 4 using Bonferroni multiple test corrections, using significance threshold of 0.05 as the type-1 error rate. We compared the integrated expression of 3 (TIM-3, PD-1, PD-L1) proteins at the patient level average and used a Student&#x2019;s t-test to compare case average mean differences.</p>
<p>The joint TME unsupervised clusters were annotated (<xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Figure S12C</xref>) using threshold calls determined by a mixed-effects linear model (&#x2018;lme4&#x2019; version 1.1.23) which for each phenotype a contrast was developed which compared for significant differences of a given sub-cluster to the primary parent phenotype average and determined significant above average (&#x002B;), average expression (mid), or significant below average (&#x2212;) expression. The annotated heatmap of the labels are depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>. The cluster proportion enrichment (DLBCL/HL) were measured using logistic regression of the disease type regressed onto the cluster proportions using univariate model, and p&#x003C;0.01 alpha level threshold.</p>
<p>In order to further investigated the joint TME we used unbiased tertile cutting of each normalized expression intensity relative to the same experiment and compared the relative case proportions to the reactive lymph node using simple linear regression (<xref rid="figS14" ref-type="fig">Figure S14</xref>). This supplementary figure avoided comparing directly the two different diseases, and measured differences between each disease to reactive lymph node using an unbiased gating strategy which created tertile cutting within the same experiment. Each subset (e.g. TIM-3&#x002B;PD-L1&#x002B; macrophage) phenotype proportion was measured relative to total primary phenotype (e.g. macrophages) in that cohort. The relative proportions were then compared to reactive lymph node.</p>

<title>Spatial classification and topology of DLBCL</title>
<p>The algorithm was motivated by Yuan et. Al study of infiltrating lymphocytes in breast cancer using H&#x0026;E whole tumor slides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Yuan defined infiltrating lymphocytes by using the centroid (the average of 5 nearest neighbors (NN) Euclidean distance to cancer cell) which identified a lymphocyte that resided inside a convex hull (domain) of 5 neighboring tumor cells. The 5-NN centroid provided additional information compared to the first nearest neighbor because if a T-cell had shorter distance to the centroid, compared to the 1-NN, this implied infiltration because the lymphocyte was in closer inside the tumor domain. We then sought to develop an algorithm which would classify the tumors by their proximity (5-NN centroids) to nearest immune cells and create a linear ordering by distance. Importantly, the tumor ordering in the context to TME proximity represented a <italic>contour immunographic map</italic>, where furthest distance to the nearest immune cell was analogous to low immune infiltration potential (&#x201C;steep valley&#x201D;), whereas tumors that were immediately co-localized to immune cells would have increased immune potential (&#x201C;top-of-hill&#x201D;).</p>
<p>In order to develop the algorithm, we generated 4 synthetic point patterns using &#x2018;spatstat (v.1.59.0)&#x2019; R package (<xref rid="figS14" ref-type="fig">Figure S14</xref>). The synthetic image 1 and 2, had three pattern types, which simulated a germinal center (pattern 1), and the T-cell zone (pattern 2), we included a &#x2018;null&#x2019; type (pattern 0) which was included in the distance algorithm, but a shape was left unassigned. The synthetic image 3 had four pattern types. Whereas synthetic image 4 had only two pattern types which demonstrated how the algorithm would order a pattern in terms of distance to the interface (pattern B). We further tested the distance classification algorithm on 6 reactive lymph nodes (<xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">Figure S15</xref>). From the raw ablation images (<xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">Figure S15C</xref>) we observed that the CD20 follicle, which captured light/dark zones, was subset (<xref rid="figS15" ref-type="fig">Figure S15A</xref>) into sub-types corresponding with nearest distance to PD-1&#x002B;TFHs and other T-cells in the paracortex region.</p>
<p>The algorithm simply computed the average distance to the 5-NN (centroids) from each B-cell toward the other immune phenotype, and then used Phenograph to meta-cluster (k<sub>1</sub>=45, k<sub>2</sub>=15), the distances into classes which were then ordered. The distance centroids for each tumor cell were used with Phenograph algorithm to classify the tumor cells into clusters dependent on their centroid distance to the immune cells, which provided an immune contour. We observed that the centroid distances were linear to 1-NN neighbors.</p>

We compared the Clark-Evans standardized indices at the ROI level in DLBCL and 6 lymph nodes and compared them using a Student&#x2019;s t-test (Tukey test for multiple comparisons).We did not include tumor_h nor tumor_e into the spatial organization model, because their abundances were highly associated with GCB (p=0.057) and NGBC (p=0.026). Tumor classes that were 10&#x0025; prevalent were selected, and rare topography classes (tumor_a (0.93&#x0025;), tumor_b (6.9&#x0025;)) were excluded. By visual inspection, classes: &#x201C;c&#x201D; (15.2&#x0025;), &#x201C;d&#x201D; (15.4&#x0025;), &#x201C;f&#x201D; (21.1&#x0025;), &#x201C;g&#x201D; (11&#x0025;), and &#x201C;i&#x201D; (14.9&#x0025;) were co-localized, however statistical significance was achieved after dropping tumor_d from the spatial organization model, however the trends were still observed.</p>

<p>We examined each major cell component (CD4, CD8, T<sub>REG</sub>, B-Cell tumor, endothelial) to ensure that all sub-clusters held homogeneous expression of the lineage expression. We re-assigned any sub-cluster that did not fit the corresponding major component being analyzed. Each major cell component was sub-clustered to optimize homogeneity of lineage specific markers which corresponded with the canonical phenotype of each primary phenotype. CD4 (denoted Th) had primarily uniform expression of CD3 and CD4, with the exception of sub-clusters Th_9 (re-assigned to CD8), Th_12, and Th_21 (re-assigned to T<sub>REG</sub>). Although Th_8 had dim CD4 expression, it did not have over-expression of an alternative lineage marker and was left in the CD4 component.</p></caption>

<p>A. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> used a linear-mixed effects model to identify significant expression heterogeneity to define phenotype thresholds. We applied tertile gating strategy, which is a common alternative for thresholding phenotypes, and gated each cohort expression relative to its own experiment.

<p>A. The logistic regression in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref> was compared against a random null model which permuted the topography labels 250 times, and re-performed the logistic regression stratified on the tumor topological cluster labels.

The (y-axis) depicts the total cases with significant interactions (p=0.025) divided by total cases averaged across the tumor topology classes (x-axis). The x-axis depicts the TME based on interactions with dispersed tumors (a, b, e, g, h), semi-penetrating TME by interactions with periphery tumors (c, f, I), and penetrating by interactions with tumor core (d).</p>
<p>C. Previously the tumor sub-clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) were determined by the protein expression alone. Each tumor phenotypic sub-cluster HLA-DR expression (Z-score) is depicted on the x-axis. The spatial interactions (1,000 permutations, interaction distance =15 microns) from the CD4 phenotypes to tumor phenotypic sub-clusters was computed (y-axis). We failed to see a linear correspondence between the tumor sub-clusters HLA-DR expression and spatial interactions with CD4. This is expected because we do not incorporate immune interactions into clustering. The repeated analysis from C was performed, however instead of the tumor phenotypic sub-clusters, we measured the spatial interactions from CD4 to the tumor spatial zones. This analysis indicated that by ordering the tumors by distance to the TME, we see a significant linear correspondence between HLA-DR expressed on the tumor and the number of CD4 interactions.</p></caption>
