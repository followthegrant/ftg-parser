<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Aims</title>
<p>We aimed to investigate the acute effects of severe SARS-CoV-2 on myocardial function.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods and Results</title>
<p>This is an observational study generated from the first 79 patients admitted to intensive care in Uppsala due to respiratory failure with SARS-CoV-2 infection, during the first wave in 2020, included in the PRONMED study. From this group 34 underwent echocardiographic examination of which 25 were included in the study, and compared to 44 non-echo patients. Demographic analysis compared standard parameters and previous morbidities between the echo and non-echo group. Standard echocardiographic parameters were analysed indicating a reduced left ventricular function as assessed by global longitudinal strain and very discrete increases in wall thickness in the group as a whole. A group comparison between the outcomes survival and death was carried out. Right sided dimensions and functional parameters did not indicate major strain. An increased maximum tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity indicating increased pulmonary arterial pressure was significantly associated with death, but failed to maintain significance when corrected for multiple comparison. Biochemical cardiac markers and D-dimer correlated to initiation of echocardiography and mortality. Tricuspid regurgitation maximum velocity was positively correlated with maximum troponin I.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These results suggests that there is no clear negative effect on cardiac function in critical SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are indications that pulmonary pressure elevation carries a negative predictive outcome suggesting pulmonary disease as the major driver of mortality. Cardiac biomarkers as well as D-dimer carry a predictive outcome value.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was established as an infection transmitted amongst humans, it has been under intense scrutiny. The effects on the cardiovascular system are still not completely understood.</p>
<p>The respiratory tract is undisputed as the main target of SARS-CoV-2, but reports of myocarditis have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), with autopsy findings showing myocardial T-cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) and SARS-CoV-2 genome in myocardial biopsies from 104 patients with suspected myocarditis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Cellular internalisation through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor also generated initial concern that heart failure and hypertension patients treated with angiotensin (Ang) inhibitors would be at increased risk due to upregulation of ACE-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) and that increased ACE-2 shedding lowers the AngI/AngII causing vasoconstriction, inflammation, and risk of thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The occurrence of venous thromboembolic disease, as well as troponin and natriuretic peptides have been shown to correlate with negative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Thus, patient assessment by echocardiography has attracted clinical interest.</p>
<p>In a study of 305 patients, 62 &#x0025; had myocardial injury as defined by elevated cardiac troponin which was associated with a both left (LV) and right (RV) ventricular abnormalities, higher admission rate to the intensive care unit (ICU), and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In 74 patients with elevated troponin, 82 &#x0025; requiring mechanical ventilation, mainly RV affliction associated with elevated D-dimer but not cardiac troponins, was observed. In the same cohort LV function was described as normal to hyperdynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In another study, LV dysfunction was not associated with higher mortality nor troponin levels, and RV dysfunction only present in 3/38 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). In 18 patients stratified into mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) only the severely ill showed elevated measures and increased end-diastolic LV pressures without an effect on LV ejection fraction (LVEF) or RV function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>RV function has gained particular attention for the management of this disease. Right but not left sided affliction was associated with death in a cohort where 63 &#x0025; of 94 patients were on mechanical ventilation support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). In 120 patients RV function and pulmonary pressure, but not left sided parameters were identified as predictors of increased mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). In 200 non-ICU-patients pulmonary hypertension (PH) without RV affliction was associated with a worsened outcome such as death or ICU admission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>).</p>
<p>We report from an exploratory study of Covid-19 patients admitted to the ICU of Uppsala University Hospital, the interrelationship between clinically initiated echocardiography, echocardiographic findings, biomarker levels, and mortality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study is a sub study of a prospective cohort study of patients that were admitted to the ICU at Uppsala University Hospital because of Covid-19. All patients were diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction from respiratory tract swabs and had respiratory failure requiring at least high flow oxygen therapy before admission to the ICU. Patients that were investigated by echocardiography were labelled &#x201C;echo&#x201D; patients and those that were not investigated by echocardiography were labelled &#x201C;non-echo&#x201D; patients.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the National Ethical Review Agency (EPM; 2020-01623) The protocol of the study was registered (Clinical trials ID: NCT04316884). The declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent revisions were followed.</p>
<p>Echocardiographic examination was carried out on clinically deemed indication by hospital certified sonographers. Analysis was carried out offline, independent of clinical analysis results, on TomTec<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> software by the primary analyst and quality-controlled by a senior echocardiographer. Analyses of poor image quality were discarded at primary analyst&#x2019;s discretion. Only patients with normo-frequent sinus rhythm were included for echocardiographic analysis. Pericardial effusion was quantified in the extra RV-RA space from the subcostal longitudinal view. For patients serially investigated by echocardiography, only the first examination was included. Normal values were assessed in relation to European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) consensus papers by Galderisi et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) and Lang et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). For assessment of pulmonary pressure, the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>Concentrations of clinically initiated biochemical cardiac blood markers during the stay in ICU, highly sensitive troponin I (hs-TnI), N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and D-dimer were compared between echo and non-echo investigated patients. Biomarker values were correlated to separate echocardiographic parameters to investigate the predictive value of such parameters on cardiac function and strain. Concentrations in the survivor and non-survivor subgroups were compared to assess a possible predictive importance from increasing levels in serum.</p>
<p>Frequency distribution testing between groups were carried out using Chi-squared test or Fischer&#x2019;s exact test for group sizes smaller than n=5. Groups were compared using Student&#x2019;s t-test for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney&#x2019;s U-test for non-normally distributed data. Correlation analysis was performed using Pearson test for normally distributed data and Spearman&#x2019;s test for non-normally distributed data. Bonferroni multiple analysis correction was applied to reduce the risk of type 1 errors, but pre-correction values are also reported. All confidence intervals are presented as standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise stated. All statistical analyses and graphs utilised GraphPad Prism 5.0.</p>

<title>Patient selection</title>
<p>Out of 79 patients originally included in the study, 34 had been assessed by echocardiography as deemed indicated by the treating physician. Out of these 9 were subsequently excluded due to initial incorrect Covid-19 diagnosis, irregular heart rhythm, 3<sup>rd</sup> degree AV-block, or overall unacceptable image quality, leaving 25 for analysis. 45 patients were included in the non-echo arm, of which one was excluded due to lack of respiratory insufficiency and oxygen therapy, leaving 44 patients in the non-echo group. A total of 69 patients were thus included in the study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">fig 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Demographic characterisation</title>
<p>There were more male than female patients overall (54:15), this ratio was less pronounced in the echo group (19:6) vs the non-echo group (35:9). Mean age in the echo group (64.4 &#x00B1; 2.6 years) was higher than in the non-echo group (56.7 &#x00B1; 2.2 years) (p&#x003C;0.05). BMI in the overall cohort was increased (28.9 &#x00B1; 0.69 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) but there was no difference between the echo (28.8 &#x00B1; 1.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and non-echo group (29.0 &#x00B1; 0.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (p&#x003E;0.05). Overall mortality in the study was 26 &#x0025;, this was higher in the echo group (44 &#x0025;) compared to the non-echo group (16 &#x0025;) (p&#x003C;0.05). Overall percentage of invasive ventilation was 55 &#x0025;, also higher in the echo (80 &#x0025;) group compared to in the non-echo group (41 &#x0025;) (p&#x003C;0.01). There was a higher presence of previous morbidities in the echo group (24&#x0025;) than in the non-echo group (4.5 &#x0025;) regarding ischemic heart disease (p&#x003C;0.05) and preceding treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) which was higher in the echo group (52 &#x0025;) compared to non-echo (25 &#x0025;) (p&#x003C;0.05). There was no difference in regards to previous heart failure, hypertension, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, or renal failure (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The non-invasive nature and high availability of transthoracic echocardiography makes it an attractive method of assessing critically ill patients in intensive care that are often in need of serial investigations to interpret effects of treatments on the underlying condition. During spring 2020 an increasing number of patients were admitted to intensive care due to Covid-19 respiratory failure. The lungs are the main target organ of this infection, but there have been reports of myocarditis and effects on both LV and RV function which is theoretically plausible through cellular internalisation via myocardial ACE-2 receptors and indeed, SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis including myocardial virus replication has now been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>From patients admitted to the ICU at Uppsala University Hospital during the first wave of Covid-19 we attempted to investigate which parameters that are affected in this group and also to derive a predictive value from the echocardiographic examination. We also correlated standard cardiac biomarkers and D-dimer values at admission as well as the maximum values in ICU to outcome and echocardiographic parameters.</p>
<p>The mortality in the group investigated by echocardiography was higher than those that were not assessed which suggests that these patients exhibited a physiological and biochemical status of increased cardiopulmonary strain which explains the higher mortality. For overall assessment of the whole cohort, the LV systolic function as assessed by GLS was lower in these patients than what to expect from standard population material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The image quality as well as patient cooperativity was however reduced in these patients compared to standard reference materials which confounds the interpretation of this isolated parameter as evidence of myocardial damage. The LVEF was not affected on average, and 3/5 patients with LVEF less than normal had a previous diagnosis of heart failure or coronary disease, neither were there signs of increased amounts of pericardial effusion. Overall diastolic dysfunction as assessed by combined evaluation of E/e&#x2019;, isolated septal diastolic movement velocity (e&#x2019;), LA volume, and TR V<sub>max</sub> could not be verified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Thus, there were no overt echocardiographic signs of myocarditis in these patients.</p>
<p>Systolic and diastolic function of the LV, as judged by LVEF, GLS, and e&#x2019;, showed no association to mortality, but there were insignificant trends towards increased LV end-diastolic diameter and LA size in the non-survival group. IVSD and left ventricle posterior wall end diastolic diameter (LVPWD) were both slightly thicker than what to expect from reference materials, this most likely reflects a high average age and presence of hypertension in the studied cohort, and trended towards thinning in the non-survival group. These findings could suggest fluid overload and passive dilation in this group, which is supported by the increased level of NT-proBNP, thus providing no evidence of myocarditis-induced oedema. Right sided parameters indicated a trend towards association with mortality. Systolic function as assessed by TAPSE, RV FAC, and RV free wall strain, showed an overall trend towards reduction in the non-survival group and the RVD1 was also increased to wider than 35 mm in 11/22 readings of all investigated patients, being insignificantly increased to 38.4 &#x00B1; 2.0 mm in the non-survivor group compared to 34.2 &#x00B1; 2.0 mm in the survivor group, which may indicate increased afterload of the RV. TR V<sub>max</sub> was increased in the non-survivor group but failed to show significance after multiple analysis correction, which suggests an elevated pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Average PAAT was also found to be in the intermediate strata suggestive of PH. In the absence of signs of LV diastolic impairment and pulmonary embolism diagnosed in only 4/25 echo patients, it is suggested this is due to hypoxia in the pulmonary arterial bed, pulmonary vasoconstriction, and RV strain.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, maximum levels of hs-TnI, NT-proBNP and D-dimer were associated with death. More interestingly, only increased admission level of hs-TnI was associated with mortality, with a trend for NT-proBNP. hs-TnI was also strongly associated with TR V<sub>max</sub>, suggesting from biochemical and echocardiographic data this parameter to be of importance in determining the outcome of Covid-19 patients in the ICU.</p>
<p>The main weakness of the study in detecting cardiac affliction from SARS-CoV-2, is that not all ICU patients underwent echocardiography, but only those where the treating physician found it indicated. This leads to a selection bias but the circumstance also enabled the comparison of echo vs non-echo patients. However, this selection ought to produce a cohort with more severe cardiac dysfunction, meaning that our results may be over-estimating the degree of cardiac dysfunction rather than underestimating it. In addition, the small cohort size and large set of variables increases the risk of false positive effects, again suggesting that the study should tend to over-estimate the effect of critical Covid-19 on cardiac function, which was corrected for in the analysis.</p>
<p>The situation of echocardiography in the ICU-setting of reduced patient cooperativity and ventilation with positive intrathoracic pressure, will reduce availability of parameters, image quality and sensitivity of interpretation which risks failing to register significant associations. For GLS measurements 4/18 were made from 2/3 standard projections, for LVEF 2/20 were made from 1/2 standard projections and for LA volume 8/20 were made from 1/2 standard projections, since images of sufficient quality was not available.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are no convincing signs of cardiac function being systematically affected in Covid-19 patients admitted to ICU, and no evidence that cardiac dysfunction is a major driver of mortality in critically ill patients with Covid-19. Still, cardiac biomarkers and D-dimer carry a predictive value in outcome, but more likely reflect strain on the heart from a primary pulmonary affliction.</p>
