<title>Introduction: - &#x201C;The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you&#x201D;</title>
<p>On 11 March 2020, WHO changed the status of the COVID-19 emergency from public health international emergency (30th January 2020) to a pandemic. Due the COVID-19 pandemic situation college students are not able to join college physically and as per WHO guideline all has to remain at home and maintain social distance, thus students has to take classes from their home. But it&#x2019;s very difficult to all the students to attend classes from home they may faced certain problems such as bad network, financial problems, not availability of internet, slow speed of internet etc.</p>
<p>Online learning is a need of the day and in India, The government and other educational organizations had design policies for online learning to implement in education field at university level, but due to less knowledge about ground realties, the policies fails to achieve the desired outcomes. A number of researches were made on various dimension of online learning, i.e., barriers and impact of online learning in the students&#x2019; academic achievements, but least study was made on the attitude of students towards online learning. Moreover, the studies were made at secondary and intermediate level but no formal efforts were made to conduct research at undergraduate level. As the undergraduate level is a crucial stage in academics and the students are more motivated and energetic at this level to perform tangible research work, therefore, to know their attitude regarding online learning is of great importance.</p>
