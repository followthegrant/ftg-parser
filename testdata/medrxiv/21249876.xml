<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Numerous neuroimaging studies demonstrated racial and ethnic disparities in brain health at older ages. It remains unclear whether racial and ethnic disparities increase with aging and whether they are already apparent in midlife.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>METHODS</title>
<p>We investigated differences in MRI markers of aging and cerebrovascular disease in 969 participants from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP; mean age: 75 years) and 496 participants from the Offspring study (mean age: 55 years) across race and ethnicity (white, Black, Latinx).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>Older whites had greater cortical thickness compared with Latinxs, who also had greater thickness than Blacks. Cortical thickness was similar across race in the middle-aged cohort. Regarding white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, Blacks had disproportionately greater WMH volume compared to both whites and Latinxs at older ages. Racial disparities are already apparent in midlife, where Blacks have disproportionately greater WMH than whites.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>D<sc>iscussion</sc></title>
<p>These findings suggest that racial disparities in WMH volume are already apparent in midlife.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Stressful lifetime events are more prevalent among Blacks and Latinx than among whites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and are associated with cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Blacks are more likely than whites to experience chronic stress in the form of material hardship, interpersonal discrimination, structural discrimination, ambient stressors, segregated housing, and personal danger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The &#x201C;Weathering Hypothesis&#x201D; suggests that repeated exposure to stress, dangerous environments, and general social disadvantage contributes to accelerated wear and tear, leading to a faster rate of aging in Blacks and Latinxs compared with whites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The Weathering Hypothesis has been proposed as a framework to understand differential health outcomes across race and ethnicity groups in late life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, including with respect to brain aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Indeed, previous studies reported racial and ethnic differences in neuroimaging markers of aging and neurodegeneration in older adults. For example, DeCarli and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> showed that older Blacks had smaller hippocampal volume than whites, particularly among those with a family history of dementia. Similarly, we previously reported increased markers of cerebrovascular disease, including white matter hyperintensities (WMH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, in Blacks and Latins Latinxs compared with white older adults.</p>
<p>It is unclear at what point in the adult lifespan racial and ethnic disparities in neuroimaging markers of brain aging emerge. While previous studies showed differences across race and ethnicity groups in late life, correlations of age with markers of brain aging generally did not differ across groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, suggesting that race- or ethnicity-related differences emerge earlier in life. The purpose of the current study was to examine differences in neuroimaging markers of brain aging, including regional cortical thickness and WMH volume, across race and ethnicity groups in middle age and late life. We hypothesized that differences between race/ethnicity groups in late life would already be apparent in middle-aged adults.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>We selected participants from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) and Offspring cohorts, two community-based studies of cognitive aging and dementia in residents of northern Manhattan, New York. Full descriptions of study procedures have been published previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Briefly, WHICAP participants were recruited in three waves, beginning in 1992, 1999, and 2009. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was introduced into the WHICAP study in 2005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> with 1.5T scanning; current analyses include participants recruited from the 2009 cohort where 1016 participants received structural scans with 3T MRI beginning in 2011<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Offspring participants are adult children of WHICAP participants, age 28 or older, fluent in English or Spanish, willing to donate a sample of blood, and willing to be followed longitudinally. To date, we have enrolled 1,469 Offspring, 549 of whom received MRI scanning. MRI participants were a random subset of the overall study cohort, intending to scan one participant per family. Only participants with complete MRI and covariates data were considered for the analyses, resulting in a sample size of 1465. Of the 1465 total participants included in our analysis, there were only 193 family units, including siblings and parent-child dyads (104 parents with 1 offspring, 60 parents with 2 offspring, 14 parents with 3 offspring, 10 parents with 4 offspring, 2 parents with 5 offspring, 2 parents with 6 offspring, and 1 parent with 8 offspring).</p>
<p>The overall subset of participants across both studies included in the present study (n=1465) met the following inclusion criteria: (1) underwent at least partial neuropsychological evaluation at the time of their MRI, (2) self-reported their race/ethnicity as white (non-Latinx; hereafter referred to as white), African-American (non-Latinx; hereafter referred to as Black) or Latinx (any race), and (3) had complete data on quantitative MRI variables of interest (i.e., WMH volume and cortical thickness). All participants gave written informed consent and received compensation for their participation. The Institutional Review Board at Columbia University Medical Center approved this study.</p>

<title>MRI acquisition and processing</title>
<p>Participants in WHICAP were scanned on a 3T Philips Intera scanner at Columbia University between 2011 and 2019. Parameters for the T1-weighted anatomical scans were: TR = 6.6 ms; TE =3.0 ms; flip angle = 8&#x00B0;; field of view (FOV) = 256 &#x2A2F; 200 &#x2A2F; 165 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>; in-plane resolution = 1 &#x2A2F; 1 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>; slices = 165. T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR; repetition time = 8000 ms, echo time = 337 ms, inversion time = 2400 ms, FOV = 240 &#x2A2F; 240 &#x2A2F; 180 matrix with 1 mm slice thickness) images were acquired in the axial orientation. Participants in Offspring were scanned on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner at Columbia University between 2018 and 2020. Parameters for the T1-weighted anatomical scans were: TR = 2300 ms; TE =2.26 ms; flip angle = 8&#x00B0;; FOV = 256 &#x2A2F; 256 &#x2A2F; 192 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>; in-plane resolution = 1 &#x2A2F; 1 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>; slices = 192. T2-weighted FLAIR (repetition time = 5000 ms, echo time = 387 ms, inversion time = 1800; FOV = 230 &#x2A2F; 230 &#x2A2F;173 matrix with .90 mm slice thickness) images were acquired in the axial orientation.</p>
<p>Using previously described procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, whole-brain WMH volumes were quantified from T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images with in-house developed software. Briefly, in WHICAP, images were brain extracted using FSL BET (Brain Extraction Tool)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and a Gaussian curve was fit to map voxel intensity values. Voxels at 2.1 standard deviations above the image mean were labeled as WMH. In Offspring, T2-weighted FLAIR images were brain extracted using HD-Bet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, then corrected for intensity inhomogeneities using the ANTs N4 bias field correction algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. High-pass filtering was then applied at the mode of distribution of the image voxel intensity values. We then fit a half Gaussian mixture model to the log-transformed histogram of the intensity values of each image. The Gaussian distribution that captured the highest intensity values were labeled as WMH. Any cluster of labeled voxels that included fewer than 5 voxels was removed from the mask. Across both studies, labeled images were also visually inspected and manually corrected if errors were detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Finally, a sum of the number of labeled voxels was then multiplied by voxel dimensions to yield a total volume in cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Regional cortical thickness was quantified with FreeSurfer version 5.1 for WHICAP and 6.0 for Offspring (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>) using T1-weighted images. A single &#x201C;AD signature&#x201D; measure was derived for each participant by averaging cortical thickness values across hemisphere in nine regions previously shown to best reflect AD neurodegeneration (Dickerson et al., 2009). These regions included: rostral medial temporal lobe (entorhinal cortex and parahippocampus), angular gyrus (inferior parietal lobe), inferior frontal lobe (pars opercularis, pars orbitalis, and pars triangularis), inferior temporal lobe (inferior temporal lobe), temporal pole (temporal pole), precuneus (precuneus), supramarginal gyrus (supramarginal gyrus), superior parietal lobe (superior parietal lobe), and superior frontal lobe (superior frontal lobe) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>We used t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square for categorical variables to evaluate differences in baseline demographic characteristics between participants in each study, including age at scan, years of education, sex/gender, and race/ethnicity. To examine the pattern of race/ethnicity differences in brain health between studies, stratified by study (Offspring and WHICAP), we used ANOVAs to compare cortical thickness and WMH volumes across race and ethnicity groups. We examined these associations in stratified models in order to better understand cohort-specific effects, given variability between cohorts (e.g., age-span, life experiences, comorbidities). Covariates included age at scan and sex/gender. We compared effect sizes to determine the magnitude of differences across race/ethnicity groups between the two studies/cohorts.</p>
<p>Participants from the Offspring study are mainly middle-aged, however, there was some overlap in age across both studies. Sensitivity analysis examined these associations after excluding participants who were not more exclusively in the middle-aged or older age group (Offspring 25-65.99 years; WHICAP=66-98 years).</p>

<p>For white matter hyperintensity volumes, in WHICAP, Blacks had greater WMH volume than whites and Latinxs, and Latinxs and whites had comparable WMH volume (main effect of race/ethnicity, F<sub>2,950</sub>=7.07, <italic>p</italic>=.001; &#x03B7;<sup>2</sup>=.02).

Pairwise effects revealed that the mean difference in WMH volume in Blacks compared with whites were much larger in Offspring than WHICAP (WHICAP Blacks = .103; Offspring Blacks = .209). In both studies, older age was associated with greater WMH volume (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Women had lower WMH volume than men in both studies, but this effect was most reliable in Offspring participants. Sensitivity analysis by exclusive middle-age and older age groups resulted in generally the same pattern, with some effects becoming even more robust (not reported).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study examined the relationship of race and ethnicity on MRI markers of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease among middle-aged and older adults from an urban community. The main finding was that WMH volume differed across race and ethnicity groups within each study (i.e., Offspring and WHICAP). Consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, there were disparities in cortical thickness in late life (i.e., WHICAP study). There was no relationship between race and ethnicity on cortical thickness in midlife (i.e., Offspring study).</p>
<p>Comparable to other reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, racial and ethnic differences in WMH burden was observed in later life, where older Blacks had disproportionately greater WMH burden than white and Latinx participants. Most interestingly, this study was the first to show that racial and ethnic differences in WMH volume were already apparent in midlife where Blacks had disproportionately greater WMH burden than whites. Together, our findings show differences in markers of cerebrovascular disease, but not neurodegeneration, among race/ethnicity groups are already apparent in midlife.</p>
<p>Our findings could be explained in part by the weathering hypothesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, which provides a framework for interpreting race-related differences in biological processes. Accordingly, the cumulative impact of social, physical, and economic adversities faced by individuals from underrepresented populations lead to early health deterioration and advanced biological aging, which is believed to be caused by chronic or reoccurring stressors. Although not the focus of the &#x201C;Weathering Hypothesis,&#x201D; these general ideas might also extend to brain health since research suggests that prolonged exposure to such adversities can have negative impacts on the brain, including increased cerebrovascular disease, resulting in higher WMH volume in Blacks in midlife, compared with whites. Others also suggest that such adversities may reduce the brain&#x2019;s ability to resist subtle brain damage, increasing the brain&#x2019;s vulnerability to pathological toxins including AD-related pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Further, previous studies reported increased dementia risk factors, cerebrovascular disease, and dementia among Blacks and Latinxs compared with whites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We postulate that the racial and ethnic disparities in cortical thickness and especially WMH burden already apparent in midlife are due to lifetime exposure to life stressors, including socioeconomic status (SES) disadvantages and differences in the prevalence of risk factors. Notably, the current study investigated race and ethnicity group differences in MRI markers across middle-aged and older age adults. However, future work will examine the factors that play a role in these associations.</p>
<p>Specifically, environmental (e.g., SES), sociocultural (e.g., institutional racism), behavioral (e.g., discrimination), and biological (e.g., inflammation) factors influence brain integrity and vary tremendously across race and ethnicity groups.</p>
<p>Of importance, when comparing the mean differences between Black and white participants within each cohort, Blacks had much higher WMH volume compared to whites in the Offspring cohort compared with the Black-white difference in WHICAP. This was surprising, especially given that the offspring cohort is over 20 years younger, on average, compared with WHICAP participants. One explanation for the observed narrowing of racial/ethnic disparities in WMH volume is that this effect may be due to a differential survival effect.</p>
<p>Previous findings show that Blacks have higher mortality rates and lower life expectancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, resulting in fewer Blacks surviving to older ages, compared to whites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Thus, middle-aged Blacks with disproportionately high WMH volume are less likely to live until older ages, and the survivors in later life exhibit a greater deal of hardiness (i.e., less brain pathology), which would lead to the observed narrowing of racial/ethnic disparities at older ages.</p>
<p>Though many of the associations between MRI markers of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease and race and ethnicity were statistically reliable, effect sizes were small. The magnitude of the relationships suggests that the observed effects are subtle. Thus, future studies will further evaluate their functional values. Future studies should also explore the implications of more severe WMH burden in Blacks compared with whites in midlife.</p>
<p>The WHICAP and Offspring cohorts include participants who are often excluded from studies of brain aging. Data from both studies, drawn from the community, provide a unique opportunity to examine the role of race and ethnicity across a much wider age-range of participants (25-98 years), who also have varied health status and diverse economic and educational backgrounds. Consequently, results from our study more likely reflect the increasing diversity of the general population. This study is the first to compare cortical thickness and WMH burden among middle-aged and older adults across 3 major racial and ethnic groups. Both studies are longitudinal and include comprehensive neuropsychological, medical, and behavioral assessments. Future work will assess the link role of medical risk factors and social determinants of health on these MRI markers in midlife. These assessments will be critical in better understanding of disparity in AD risk across ethnoracial groups.</p>
