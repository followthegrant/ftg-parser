Strikingly, &#x03B1;-actinin -4 and Talin-1 degradation profiles were not observed in circulatory-death or living-donor kidneys. As Talin-1 is a specific proteolytic target of Calpain-1, we investigated a potential trigger of Calpain activation and Talin-1 degradation using ex-vivo precision-cut human kidney slices and in-vitro immortalised human podocytes. Notably, we found that Transforming-Growth Factor-&#x03B2; (TGF-&#x03B2;) activated Calpain-1 and proteolytically cleaved Talin-1 to generate distinct peptide fragments. These peptide fragments were of similar size and matched the degradation patterns observed in DBD kidneys. Talin-1 degradation was prevented in vitro by Calpain-1 inhibition.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here, we provide initial evidence that DBD kidneys are susceptible to cytoskeletal protein degradation that impacts posttransplant kidney function.

<label>1.</label><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Kidney transplantation is the only curative treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease. When compared to dialysis, transplantation profoundly increases life-expectancy, improves quality of life (QoL) and is cost-effective <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Deceased kidney donation after brain death (DBD) is the main source of transplants, yet these grafts yield inferior short and long-term transplant outcomes when compared to living donation. This makes kidney allograft failure one of the most common morbidities to start dialysis in the UK and the USA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The process of brain death and subsequent donor management in intensive care units is associated with a complex homeostatic dysregulation in the donor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> strongly suggesting that brain death negatively impacts organ quality <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In fact, brain death associates with a specific pattern of damage to renal substructures including the podocyte, which will compromise post-transplant graft function and graft survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. As yet, the molecular processes underlying brain death-associated glomerular injury, with the potential for targeted interventions and pharmaceutical prevention, are unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Proteolytic damage of podocytes is a common effector pathway for glomerular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Recent studies in experimental models, suggest that the maintenance of renal filtration barrier largely relies on proteases as key regulators of podocyte integrity and kidney function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Evidence that dysregulation of proteolytic pathways is a key driver for human disease signifying proteases as promising targets for tailored therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we hypothesized that brain death induced kidney cytoskeletal alterations mediated by proteolytic processes are associated with subsequent suboptimal transplant outcomes. To investigate this, we analysed donor kidney biopsies that were selected on the basis of paired transplant outcomes and classified the donors as suboptimal (SO) or good (GO) subgroups. We initially profiled the protein degradome (proteolytic modifications) of pre-implantation kidney biopsies from DBD grafts with contrasting long-term functional outcomes by utilizing the Protein Topography and Migration Analysis Platform (PROTOMAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> with a focus on proteins enriched in the kidney cytoskeleton. Next, to investigate whether protein degradation was donor-type specific, we profiled the proteolytic patterns of a number of key proteins on a separate cohort of DBD, DCD and living donor kidney biopsies by immunoblotting that allowed detailed description of proteolytic fragments. Based on our previous research findings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and to gather initial evidence of a potential trigger of kidney protein degradation, we investigated, by applying an <italic>ex-vivo</italic> model of precision cut human kidney slices and an <italic>in-vitro</italic> model of immortalized human kidney podocytes, whether TGF-&#x03B2;-Calpain interaction may drive degradation of key structural proteins destabilizing the podocyte cytoskeleton.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<label>2.1</label><title>Clinical characteristics of donor cohorts</title>
<p>This study is based on the analysis of pre-transplantation kidney biopsies obtained from 65 deceased and living kidney donors. Deceased donor kidney biopsies were obtained from the Quality in Organ Donor (QUOD) biobank, a national multicenter UK wide bioresource of deceased donor clinical samples procured during donor management and organ procurement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Healthy living donor (LD) kidney biopsies were collected by the Oxford Transplant Biobank (OTB).</p>
<p>Selection of donor kidneys was based on paired 12month post-transplant outcomes. To minimize the impact of recipient factors on outcomes we only included kidneys for which the contralateral kidney was transplanted and had similar 12-month post-transplant outcome; either suboptimal outcome (SO) or good outcome (GO). For DBD, average 12-months post-transplant estimated (e)GFR of suboptimal outcome (SO) grafts was 31 &#x00B1; 9 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (mean (&#x00B1;SD), and for good outcome (GO) was 82 &#x00B1; 22 mL/min (mean (&#x00B1;SD) per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). For DCD, average 12-months post-transplant eGFR of SO grafts was 29&#x00B1;9 ml/min/1.73mm<sup>3</sup> and for GO grafts was 77&#x00B1;17 ml/min/1.73mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>All clinical samples were linked to corresponding donor and recipient demographic and clinical meta data, provided by NHS Blood and Transplant registry (NHSBT) as described in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Biopsies were selected from one kidney per donor, either the left or right kidney, selected at random. The biopsies were then divided in two, with one half stored in RNAlater, then liquid nitrogen and the other stored in formalin.</p>

<p>Deceased and living donor biopsies were collected according to the same stringent predefined collection protocols. Deceased and living donor kidney biopsies were collected <italic>ex situ</italic> from the upper pole of the donor kidney cortex during back table preparation in the donor hospital, using a 23mm needle biopsy gun. All donor (deceased and living) kidney biopsies were procured with identical protocols to minimize pre-analytical variability and technical precautions were taken to eliminate ex-vivo sample proteolysis.</p>
<p>For the initial degradomics profiling by PROTOMAP, we analysed two cohorts of pooled biopsy homogenates of DBD (n&#x003D;10) kidneys with contrasting transplant outcomes SO vs GO (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A&#x0026;B</xref>). Degradomics data were confirmed by Western blot on an independent cohort of DBD (n&#x003D;22) donor kidneys. Biopsies from DCD donor kidneys (n&#x003D;23) with suboptimal outcomes (SO), good outcomes (GO) and from living donors (LD, n&#x003D;10) with good 12-month transplant outcomes were included as a reference cohort. Donor and recipient characteristics are shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

The analysis shortlisted 8 podocyte proteins that were proteolytically cleaved in SO DBD kidneys. Western blotting on a validation cohort of deceased (DBD&#x0026; DCD) and living donor (LD) kidney biopsies showed brain death specific degradation patterns.

Bioinformatics analysis combined data from the gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry spectra to generate peptographs that provided information on degradation profiles of the intact protein and the generated fragments. The resulting peptographs were screened to identify proteins with evidence of endogenous proteolysis and generation of fragment intermediates at a lower molecular weight than the full length. The selection of proteins for further analysis was based on the following factors: i) increased spectral counts of fragments that had migrated at a lower molecular mass in SO (blue bars) versus GO (red bars), ii) enrichment of the intact protein or protein fragments in the SO group and iii) biological relevance, with an emphasis on cytoskeletal proteins involved in the podocyte.</p></caption>

<p>Informed consent from donor families was obtained prior to sample procurement. Collection of QUOD samples and the research ethics approval was provided by QUOD (NW/18/0187). The collection of living donor samples and research ethics approval was provided by Oxford Transplant Biobank (OTB) 19/SC/0529.</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>RNA later treated kidney biopsies were homogenised in RIPA buffer (89900, Thermo Scientific, Illinois, USA) with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (1861280, Thermo Scientific, Illinois, USA) using a bead beater (Biorad, Hertfordshire, UK) at 6500rpm for three cycles of 40 seconds with intermediate cooling on wet ice between cycles. Biopsy protein concentration was determined using a Pierce Bicinchoninic Acid protein assay kit (23227 Thermo Scientific, Illinois, USA). Remaining lysates were aliquoted and stored at -80&#x00B0;C until analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<label>2.4</label><title>Protein Topography and Migration analysis platform (PROTOMAP)</title>
<p>Kidney biopsies from the QUOD biobank were prepared and analysed by PROTOMAP as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In brief, PROTOMAP analysis was used to compare the profiles between two experimental cohorts; suboptimal (SO) and good outcomes (GO). Five biopsies per clinical outcome (SO vs GO, n&#x003D;5 each) were pooled to a final aliquot of 100&#x03BC;g. Pools were denatured and reduced in standard Laemmli buffer with DTT and divided into two equal aliquots and separated by SDS-PAGE (NOVEX, Invitrogen 4-12% gradient, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The gels were stained with Coomassie instant blue and each pooled sample lane cut into 22 horizontal slices, generating 44 samples overall. The gel pieces were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Briefly, gel pieces were de-stained in a solution of 1 ml 50 % methanol, 5 % acetic acid in Milli-Q-H2O solution until transparent, then dehydrated using 200 &#x00B5;l acetonitrile (ACN) for 5 min. Proteins in gel pieces were reduced by addition of 30 &#x00B5;l of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min followed by alkylation with 30 &#x00B5;l of 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 30 min. Gel pieces were dehydrated with 200 &#x00B5;l ACN, resuspended in 30 &#x00B5;l 100 mM ammonium bi-carbonate containing 20 ng/&#x00B5;l trypsin and incubated overnight at 37 &#x00B0;C with gentle mixing. Peptide digests were extracted from the gel matrix using 50 &#x00B5;l extraction buffer I (50 % ACN, 5 % FA) followed by 50 &#x00B5;l extraction buffer II (85 % ACN, 5 % FA), collected and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in 30 &#x00B5;l of buffer A (98 % Milli-Q-H2O, 2 % acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid) and analysed by nano ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<label>2.5</label><title>Analysis of PROTOMAP derived mass spectrometry data</title>
<p>The PROTOMAP method incorporates the protein migration patterns on SDS-PAGE electrophoresis with peptide sequence coverage and spectral counts acquired by LC-MS/MS analysis, allowing the results to be visualised as peptographs for every identified protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> To do this, the raw MS data was converted to Mascot generic files using msconvert (Proteowizard, version 2) and further analysed as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Briefly, MS/MS spectra data were searched using Mascot v2.5.1 against the UniProt <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> reference proteome (version 2017). Mascot results were then exported as DTASelect files with a false discovery rate threshold of 1% and analysed using the PROTMAP perl scripts obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scripps.edu/cravatt/protomap/">http://www.scripps.edu/cravatt/protomap/</ext-link>. The data were then processed generating the peptographs using custom Perl scripts as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Each of the peptographs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) has two panels. The left shows the protein sequence overage from N- to C-terminus in each band. Peptide sequences represented in red are from GO donors and in blue from SO donors; whilst the purple fragments are common to both experimental cohorts. The right panel shows the relative quantitation using spectral counts for each protein between the two pools. Protein degradation was defined by fragments with spectral counts detected at a lower molecular weight compared to the expected size of the full- length protein. As the analysis included technical duplicates for each sample, for each resulting peptograph, spectral counts were averaged for each band and condition and displayed with error bars representing standard errors of the mean.</p>
<sec id="s2e1">
<title>Pathway analysis</title>
<p>Stringent selection criteria were applied for the analysis and shortlist of protein peptographs with the requirement for at least 20% protein sequence coverage for shortlisting proteins. The selected dataset of 2,320 protein IDs and 1554 protein classes was entered to PANTHER classification system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> v 14.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pantherdb.org/">http://pantherdb.org/</ext-link>) to cluster the proteins according to biological function. Protein datasets of specific clusters were further analysed to identify protein - protein interactions, prevalent KEGG pathways and pathway enrichment using STRING<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> version 11.0, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org/">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD022074 and 10.6019/PXD022074.</p>

<label>3.1</label><title>Clinical characteristics of deceased and living donors</title>
<p>Kidney biopsies were obtained from DBD, DCD and living donors at the back table immediately after kidney procurement. To minimize the impact of cofounding factors related to post-procurement and recipient factors, donors were selected on the basis of paired 12-m post-transplant outcomes. Clinical metadata confirmed that the selected donor groups were representative of the donor population in UK and shown limited clinical variability (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The DBD SO group with median age (57&#x002B;/-10y) were older than DCD SO (51&#x002B;/-5y) but the age difference was not considered to be clinically significant. There was also no correlation of protein fragment intensity with donor age as described in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Intracranial event (trauma/hemorrhage) was the main cause of death for DBDs and DCDs. There were more DBD donors with AKIN 1-3 than DCD, likely to reflect the uncertainty of clinicians in accepting DCD kidneys with AKIN&#x003E;1. Duration of donor admission to cold perfusion, WIT and CIT were all comparable among all donor subgroups. KDPI profiles revealed clear differences in the 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles between SO and GO in both donor types, notably there was no difference between DBDs and DCDs. In the associated metadata has been recorded that one of the DBD SO donors had a 5.4-fold increase of serum creatinine (from admission to terminal) and this increased the mean S-Cr value of DBD SO to reach significance when compared to DBD GO. If we exclude this outlier value, then the mean of terminal S-Cr DBD SO (81&#x002B;/-44) is comparable to DCD SO (88&#x002B;/-26) (&#x00B5;mol/L). Recipients mean 12-month post-transplant eGFR was significant different between SO vs GO (SO vs GO; <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.0001).</p>

<label>3.2</label><title>PROTOMAP shows degradation alterations associate to extreme transplant outcomes</title>
<p>Putative differences in the pre-implantation kidney degradome of SO and GO DBD kidneys were mapped through the Protein Topography and Migration Analysis Platform (PROTOMAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>This analysis generated 15,700 peptographs corresponding to 6,700 proteins. Stringent selection criteria (including the requirement for at least 20% protein sequence coverage for shortlisting proteins) reduced the data set to 2,320 protein IDs and 1554 protein classes. Pathway analysis performed using (PANTHER 16.0) mapped 135 of these proteins as cytoskeletal and 65 of these linked to the integrin regulation pathway. Direct protein-protein interactions (STRING 6.0) showed enrichment of KEGG pathways of focal adhesion false discovery rate (FDR) 2.11 e-33, catabolic regulation FDR 1.06 e-09 and integrin mediated signaling FDR 3.09e-9 (Supplementary SF1).</p>
<p>To identify evidence of increased proteolysis in donor kidneys, we scanned the peptographs of the cytoskeletal proteins to detect the generation of lower molecular mass fragments of intact proteins in SO kidneys (blue bars) not observed in GO kidneys (red bars) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Eight proteins mapped to podocyte cytoskeleton; &#x03B1;-actinin-1, -4, Talin -1, -2, Utrophin, Laminin &#x03B2;2, Synaptopodin, Integrin &#x03B1;-1, showed specific and contrasting degradation profiles for SO when compared to GO grafts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Supplementary SF1 &#x0026; SF2). To confirm protein degradation detected in PROTOMAP data and further investigate whether there were donor type specific differences in the degradome, we performed a targeted analysis of &#x03B1;-actinin -4 and Talin -1 by Western blot on deceased and living donor kidney biopsies. The cohort of samples selected for blotting was independent of the samples pooled to PROTOMAP analysis.</p>

The profile of &#x03B1;-actinin-4 showed clearly that protein degradation had occurred only in DBD kidneys but not in DCD or LD kidneys (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The detected fragments generated from the full-length 105KDa protein were significantly enhanced in SO, compared to GO DBD kidneys (P&#x003C;0.05), to DCD (P&#x003C;0.05) and LDs (P&#x003C;0.001) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the key role of Talin-1 in sustaining the podocyte integrity and since we had shown that Talin-1 was markedly degraded in DBD SO kidneys, we examined whether the interaction of TGF-&#x03B2; and Calpain-1 led to degradation of Talin cytoskeletal protein in this <italic>in vitro</italic> model.</p>
<p>Analysis by Western blot of TGF-&#x03B2; treated podocyte homogenates revealed that Talin-1 was proteolytically processed with the generation of distinct fragments at &#x223C;190, &#x223C;125 and &#x223C;100 kDa (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Notably, the &#x223C;125kDa fragment we had previously shown to be distinct in the DBD SO kidney biopsies with corresponding degradation of the full-length protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> &#x0026; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>), was generated in podocytes in a TGF-&#x03B2; concentration dependent manner. Inhibition with Calpeptin prior and during TGF-&#x03B2; stimulation, reduced the proteolytic processing, limited the generation of the 125KDa fragment and reduced cleavage of full-length Talin-1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). This result strongly suggested that Talin-1 degradation in this model was mediated by Calpain, activated in turn by the treatment of podocyte cells with TGF-&#x03B2; (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>As podocyte motility is a key measurement of podocyte integrity in kidney disease; we examined podocyte motility by determining how TGF-&#x03B2; treatment impacted actin remodeling. Following TGF-&#x03B2; stimulation of podocyte cells, there was significant reduction of the actin stress fibers compared to the untreated cells (P&#x003C;0.01) and TGF-&#x03B2;&#x002B;calpeptin treated cells (&#x003C;0.05) as measured by rhodamine phalloidin staining (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D &#x0026; E</xref>). Taking together, these data show that TGF-&#x03B2; triggered Calpain activation negatively impacted the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton. The observed impact was inhibited by Calpain inhibition, preserving the podocyte cytoskeleton.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Our data, obtained from a unique cohort of pre transplant biopsies from DBD, DCD and LD kidneys, provide initial evidence that the activation of proteolytic processes in DBD kidneys causes cytoskeletal alterations that may deem these grafts susceptible to subsequent injury, impacting on post-transplant graft function. Replicating the observed DBD kidney key degradation profiles of Talin-1 in human kidney immortalised podocyte cells treated with TGF-&#x03B2; suggests the podocyte cytoskeleton as a target of proteolytic modifications that merits further investigation.</p>
<p>Brain death donor kidneys are the preferred source of deceased donor transplants worldwide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. While improvements in organ procurement, immune suppression regimes and treatment of postoperative complications have greatly improved transplant outcomes, biological processes related to brain death still exert a detrimental effect on short- and long- term allograft function compared to living donor transplants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Impaired long-term outcomes result in graft failure, return to dialysis and re-transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. As we increasingly accept older and higher risk organs from DBD donors, a better insight into processes associated with brain death impact on donor kidney quality is crucial to reduce injury and design novel targeted interventions to recondition these organs.</p>
<p>To investigate the donor kidney degradome we analysed deceased and living donor kidney biopsies obtained with identical procurement protocols to minimize pre-analytical confounding factors. The selection of donor kidneys was based on paired transplant outcomes that limited the impact of surgical and recipient heterogeneity on post-transplant function. This stringent experimental selection also increased our confidence in obtaining meaningful data with the analysed sample size. Initial degradomics profiling of DBD kidneys with extreme outcomes followed by western blotting of an independent cohort of DBD, DCD and LD kidney biopsies.</p>
<p>We, and more recently others, have shown that the application of the PROTOMAP technique to complex clinical samples provides a comprehensive profiling of both N- and C- terminal proteoforms with sufficient sequence coverage to determine epitope coverage by commercial antibodies, thereby allowing validation by immunoblotting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Initial, unbiased PROTOMAP degradation profiling and pathway analysis mapped &#x03B1; -actinin, Synaptopodin, Talin, Laminin &#x03B2;2, Integrin &#x03B1;1 and Utrophin as a cluster of cytoskeletal proteins associated with focal adhesion in podocytes had undergone enhanced proteolytic processing in DBD kidneys with SO post-transplant function. Evidence that proteolytic cleavage of key podocyte proteins is a destabilizing process that damages the integrity of podocytes and the glomerular filtration barrier has been previously shown in experimental models but with limited evidence on human kidneys to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Therefore, to further investigate protein degradation of podocyte cytoskeleton and to better visualize donor specific degradation patterns, we examined degradome profiles in DBD, DCD and LD kidney biopsies by Western blotting on a separate cohort of donor kidney biopsies. Blotting confirmed our PROTOMAP data showing that DBD-specific &#x03B1; -actinin-4 and Talin-1 peptide fragments were enriched in suboptimal outcome grafts indicating that these proteins had undergone proteolytic processing.</p>
<p>Although these two actin-binding proteins had been previously identified, mainly in-vitro and preclinical settings, as susceptible to proteolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, here we showed that for these proteins, preferential proteolytic modification in DBD kidneys may cause subclinical changes in the grafts leading to post-transplant dysfunction.</p>
<p>We looked in detail the donor and recipient clinical metadata and no clinically associated differences could explain the observed kidney proteolytic profiles between DBD, DCD and LD as there was limited heterogeneity between the subgroups. The DBD-SO group was older than the rest of donor groups, but the mean age was representative of the deceased donor population in UK. Furthermore, we confirmed that there was no correlation of proteolytic fragment generation with donor age. Donor eGFR and AKIN were comparable between donors. Finally, there was a significant negative correlation (p&#x003C;0.05) of protein degradation fragment generation to graft function as expressed by recipient 12-month eGFR.</p>
<p>We observed that in GO &#x0026; SO DCDs and LDs the &#x223C; 125kDa Talin-1 protein fragment co-existed with the Talin-1 full length protein that appeared intact in most samples of these donor cohorts. We suggest that the generation of the &#x223C;125kDa fragment may also results from normal protein turnover as part of the physiological maintenance of cellular homeostasis. In contrast, for the majority of SO DBD kidneys there was a specific loss of Talin-1 full length protein with a significant increase in the ratio of &#x223C;125kDa to full length protein compared to GO DBDs, DCDs and LDs that suggests DBD specific activation of proteolytic processes were increased in SO kidneys. Talin-1 has a pivotal role in integrin activation but also, notably, in linking integrins to actin cytoskeleton to sustain the normal kidney physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Consequently, Talin-1 cleavage decouples integrins to actin cytoskeleton resulting in podocyte injury and kidney pathology, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Taking together, these data suggest that brain death specific proteolytic mechanisms may result in cleavage of cytoskeletal proteins, with SO donor kidneys affected more profoundly than GO.</p>
<p>Talin-1 is a specific Calpain target protein that can be cleaved on a number of sites by Calpain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, shown schematically in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>. As our results show that Talin-1 undergoes proteolytic processing in DBD kidneys and human kidney immortalized podocytes, we hypothesised that Talin-1 proteolysis resulted from activation of calcium-dependent protease Calpain and, as Calpain can cleave multiple targets, it could be a key proteolytic pathway in SO DBDs. This was supported by the PROTOMAP and western blot data on Calpain-1 specific proteolytic patterns indicative of enzymatic activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Calpain proteases are activated directly by increased levels of intracellular levels of Ca<sup>&#x002B;2</sup>, micromolar levels favors Calpain-1 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Their physiological roles include cytoskeletal remodeling, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis in addition to proteolysis of specific targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Calpain-1 is known to proteolytically target Utrophin, &#x03B1;-actinin-4, and Dystroglycan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and Calpain mediated degradation of Utrophin in muscle cells is reported to generate a &#x223C;190kDa intermediate that has also been observed in the kidney PROTOMAP data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. To investigate a possible trigger for Calpain activation in DBD kidneys we built on our previous findings showing that TGF-&#x03B2; signaling is predominant in DBD kidneys compared to DCDs and enhanced in SO DBDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> As a result, we investigated if there was a direct link between increased TGF-&#x03B2; activity and Calpain activation in SO DBD kidneys.</p>
<p>We used <italic>ex vivo</italic> precision cut kidney slices and <italic>in vitro</italic> podocytes to show that TGF-&#x03B2; mediated Calpain-1 activation causing Talin proteolysis with degradation patterns that were fully aligned with the profile observed in DBD donor kidneys. More specifically, increasing TGF-&#x03B2; concentrations resulted in progressive Talin fragmentation and generation of the &#x223C;125kDa proteoform that resembled the fragment detected in DBD kidneys. The role of Calpain in this cascade was confirmed by the protective effect of Calpeptin, a Calpain specific inhibitor. In our experiments, Calpeptin markedly reduced TGF-&#x03B2; driven degradation and prevented actin cytoskeletal dysregulation. This evidence of a TGF-&#x03B2;-Calpain interaction is supported by recent reports of TGF-&#x03B2; mediated Calpain activation during endothelial mesenchymal transition to myofibroblasts and onset of fibrosis; signaling events that were reversed by Calpeptin treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. In the context of renal disease, Calpeptin has been demonstrated to prevent proteolytic processing of Talin and dysregulation of actin cytoskeleton, thus preventing glomerular injury, in rodent and <italic>in vitro</italic> models of experimental focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Our findings may provide a mechanistic insight to explain why transplants from living donors have superior function when compared to grafts procured from DBD donors.</p>
<p>Following severe cerebral injury, cerebral ischemia and brain stem death cause the release of endogenous cytokines and catecholamines that trigger a &#x201C;sympathetic or catecholamine storm&#x201D; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Increased levels of catecholamines in circulation increase the heart load and oxygen consumption with the production of reactive species at the cellular level. Hypoxic periods of kidney hypoperfusion associate with low energy delivery and depletion of ATP synthesis causing mitochondria disruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. These biological stressors trigger various cell stimuli such as membrane depolarization causing increased intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> influx <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. In podocytes, impaired Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup> homeostasis, detected by specialized Ca<sup>2&#x002B;</sup>-sensing proteins deciphers signalling cascades activate the Calpain network of endopeptidases. Once Calpain is activated it triggers proteolytic pathways that may modify the integrity of the podocyte cytoskeletal matrix in donor kidneys. These cytoskeletal changes may be sustained post-transplant, thereby contributing to progressive development of allograft dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Further studies would be informative to assess the impact of brain death triggered proteolysis on donor organs other than the kidney. It is highly probable that the complex biological changes during brain death and donor management may activate additional proteolytic mechanisms that would be important to further investigate. Moreover, the overall severity of cytoskeletal proteolytic degradation may also define whether the donor related injury is irreversible, possibly explaining the more limited protein cleavage that was observed in good outcome donor kidneys.</p>
<p>Emerging interest in the therapeutic application of Calpain inhibition to treat diseases such as muscular dystrophy, neurological injury, ischemia/reperfusion injury, clearly points towards preventative opportunities to improve donor grafts early after brain death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. A targeted intervention to modulate or inhibit Calpain activation as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent podocyte damage might not only improve allograft function but also survival, closing the gap between brain death and living donor outcomes.</p>
<p>As our observations were derived from donor kidneys, we were faced with limitations related to biological heterogeneity, reflected by the observation that in some donors Talin detection was low. This might also be explained by heterogeneity in the number of glomeruli in the analyzed preimplantation biopsies. Notably, our findings make associations of the podocyte alterations to allograft dysfunction although we need to acknowledge that kidney injury can extend to substructures beyond glomeruli.</p>
<p>To enhance these promising results, preclinical studies will be needed to confirm the direct interaction of TGF-&#x03B2; to Calpain activation and explore parallel proteolytic pathways that may also play a role in destabilizing the podocyte cytoskeleton.</p>
<p>In summary, our data, obtained from a unique cohort of biopsies from donor kidneys that developed long-term allograft dysfunction, suggests that DBD kidneys, when compared to DCD and LD, are more susceptible to protein degradation and that enhanced proteolysis can be linked to impaired graft function 12-month post-transplant. Employing complementary models of precision cut human kidney slices and human immortalized podocyte cells we provided initial evidence of the role of TGF-&#x03B2; and Calpain-1 in driving degradation and, importantly, we demonstrated <italic>in-vitro</italic> that podocyte Talin-1 degradation mirrored Talin proteolytic patterns identified in DBD kidney biopsies. Our findings suggest a scope to further study this alternative pathway of donor kidney injury that may offers novel therapeutic strategies to prevent podocyte damage preserving kidney function.</p>
