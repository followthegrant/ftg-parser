<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p>COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than 46 million people worldwide and caused more than 1.2 million deaths. It is transmitted by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and affects the respiratory tract as well as extra-pulmonary systems, including the pancreas, that express the virus entry receptor, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Importantly, the endocrine and exocrine pancreas, the latter composed of ductal and acinar cells, express high levels of ACE2, which correlates to impaired functionality characterized as acute pancreatitis observed in some cases presenting with COVID-19. Since acute pancreatitis is already one of the most frequent gastrointestinal causes of hospitalization in the U.S. and the majority of studies investigating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the pancreas are clinical and observational, we utilized human iPSC technology to investigate the potential deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures containing endocrine and exocrine cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting iPSC-derived pancreatic cells, thus perturbing their normal molecular and cellular phenotypes. The infection increased a key inflammatory cytokine, CXCL12, known to be involved in pancreas dysfunction. Transcriptome analysis of infected pancreatic cultures confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the ribosomal machinery in these cells. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of the pancreas is confirmed in post-mortem tissues from COVID-19 patients, which showed co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 in pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells and increased the expression of some pancreatic ductal stress response genes. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human iPSC-derived pancreatic cells with supporting evidence of presence of the virus in post-mortem pancreatic tissue of confirmed COVID-19 human cases. This novel model of iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures will open new avenues for the comprehension of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially establish a platform for endocrine and exocrine pancreas-specific antiviral drug screening.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), initiated in China at the end of 2019 and rapidly escalated to global outbreak, infecting more than 101 million people and resulting in related fatalities in more than 2.1 million by the end of January (JHU Dataset 2021). Although predominantly considered a respiratory disease, nearly one quarter of COVID-19 patients present other symptoms not related to the respiratory tract but to the gastrointestinal (GI) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cevik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through binding of virus Spike protein (S) to ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2) receptor and activation of the virus by TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Protease, serine 2). Interestingly, many other cells besides lung alveolar epithelial cells express ACE2 receptors, including heart, pancreas, GI tract, kidney, testis and other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), thus making them a target for the virus. This is supported by studies came demonstrating that virus can affect other tissues, including the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>), vascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Varga et al., 2020</xref>), kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Pelayo et al., 2020</xref>), liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shukla and Mohanka, 2020</xref>) and the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mukherjee et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Pinte and Baicus 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tuttolomondo et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The pancreas, specifically the exocrine compartment (acinar and ductal cells), has high expression of ACE2 as analyzed by bulk RNA-seq data (GTEx database) and single-cell RNA-seq of the pancreas (NCBI-GEO database) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). GTEx and TCGA (Genomic Data Commons Data Portal) datasets from human pancreas indicate no differences in ACE2 expression between males or females, as well as between younger (age &#x02264; 49 years) and older (age &#x02265; 49 years) populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, recent findings have shown protein expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in pancreatic cells from healthy humans, especially in the exocrine portion of the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Coate et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kusmartseva et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, few clinical reports provide evidence that some patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who have never presented pancreatic injuries show signs of acute pancreatitis-like symptoms, including elevated levels of serum amylase and lipase, and enlargement of the pancreas as seen in imaging evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Acute pancreatitis is the major GI cause of hospitalization in the U.S.A., and despite the most common etiologies of this disease being related to gallstones and alcohol abuse, 10% of the cases are caused by infectious microorganisms including viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Rawla et al. 2017</xref>). Pertinent to the endocrine pancreas, it is now well-established that patients with type I (T1D) and II (T2D) diabetes have a higher risk for COVID-19 associated mortality, especially patients with associated comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases and renal impairment, as indicated by a study with a large cohort of diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Holman et al., 2020</xref>). Diabetic patients (mostly T2D) infected with SARS-CoV-2 presented worse outcomes compared to non-diabetic patients, such as admission to the ICU, mechanical ventilation requirement and higher mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Apicella et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, there is a paucity of knowledge whether and how SARS-CoV-2 can infect and impact the pancreas. This highlights the need for additional investigations to dissect and understand the potential influence of SARS-CoV-2 on human endocrine and exocrine pancreas.</p>
<p>Since primary human pancreatic cells are largely inaccessible and established cell lines do not fully represent human pancreas pathophysiology, we have developed novel methods to generate pancreatic progenitors from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can be differentiated into endocrine (islet &#x03B2;-cells) and exocrine (acinar and ductal) cells. These cultures contain cells that are representative of human endocrine pancreas expressing endocrine NKX6.1 and C-peptide, exocrine acinar Amylase and Chymotrypsin (CTRC) and exocrine ductal Cytokeratin19 (CK19) and SOX9 cells. We show for the first time that iPSC-derived pancreatic cells including endocrine and exocrine cell types are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in morphological perturbations as well as impaired expression of key markers. Importantly, these cellular phenotypes corresponded with inflammatory signatures. Infection of pancreatic tissue was also confirmed in post-mortem pancreatic tissues from COVID-19 patients. Thus, these results suggest the pancreatic cells are susceptible to direct infection by SARS-CoV-2. The iPSC-based model described here provides a valuable novel platform for understanding the pancreas-specific cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 as well as for antiviral drug development against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Ethics Statement and Institutional Approvals</title>
<p>Human cell lines, tissues and histology specimens were obtained or created at Cedars-Sinai under the auspices of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols. Specifically, the iPSC cell lines and differentiation protocols in the present study were carried out in accordance with the guidelines approved by Stem Cell Research Oversight committee (SCRO) and IRB, under the auspices of IRB-SCRO Protocols Pro00032834 (iPSC Core Repository and Stem Cell Program) and Pro00036896 (Sareen Stem Cell Program). Infections of iPSC-derived cells were performed under the auspices of UCLA&#x2019;s Stem Cell Oversight Committee under protocol #2020-004-01 and UCLA Biosafety Committee protocol BUA-2020-015-004-A. Post-mortem tissues were collected by Cedars-Sinai&#x2019;s Biobank and Translational Research core in accordance with protocol Pro00036514.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Human iPSC culture</title>
<p>The induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines utilized in this study were generated from healthy volunteers at the iPSC Core at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) utilizing non-integrating oriP/EBNA1-based episomal plasmid vectors, as described in(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rajamani et al., 2018</xref>). This approach results in highly cytogenetically stable iPSCs as tested by G-band karyotyping. All undifferentiated iPSCs were maintained in mTeSR<sup>&#x002B;</sup> media (StemCell Technologies, Cat 05825) onto BD Matrigel&#x2122; matrix-coated plates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Generation of iPSC-differentiated Pancreatic Progenitors</title>
<p>iPSCs were single-cell dissociated using Accutase and plated onto Matrigel-coated plates at a density of 300,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> using mTeSR<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and 10 &#x00B5;M Rho kinase Inhibitor (Stem Cell Tech). The following day, cells were directed into Definitive Endoderm (DE) using Phase I medium, which was composed of base medium MCDB 131 (Fisher Sci) supplemented with 100 ng/ml Activin A (R&#x0026;D), 2 &#x00B5;M CHIR99021 (Stemgent), and 10 &#x00B5;M Rho kinase Inhibitor (Stem Cell Tech.) for 1 day. For the next two days, the same base medium was used, but supplemented instead with 100 ng/mL Activin A and 5 ng/mL FGF2 (Peprotech). Following this phase, cells were directed to form Posterior Foregut (PFG) using Phase II medium, which was composed of the same base medium as Phase I but supplemented with 50 ng/mL FGF10 (Peprotech), 0.25 &#x00B5;M CHIR99021 and 50 ng/ml Noggin (Peprotech), for 2 days. To reach a Pancreatic Progenitor (PP) stage, cells were fed with Phase III medium, which was composed of DMEM supplemented with 50 ng/mL Noggin, 50 ng/mL FGF10, 2 &#x00B5;M Retinoic Acid (Sigma), and 0.25 &#x00B5;M SANT1 (Sigma), for four days. More details about base medium formulation are described at <bold>Suppl. Table 1</bold>. This protocol was based on a published protocol to differentiate iPSCs into Pancreatic Progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Memon et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Generation of iPSC-differentiated Pancreatic Endocrine (iPan<sup>ENDO</sup>), Acinar (iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Acinar) and Ductal (iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Ductal) cells</title>
<p>To generate iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Ductal cells, on Day 7 of differentiation, cells were single cell dissociated and seeded at 103.1k cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in Phase III medium supplemented with 10 &#x00B5;M Rho kinase Inhibitor on a Matrigel-coated plate. From Day 8 to Day 26, cells were grown in iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Ductal phase media, which consisted of Phase III base medium supplemented with 25 ng/ml FGF10, 50 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech), and 25 ng/ml sDLL-1 (Peprotech). To generate iPan<sup>ENDO</sup> and iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Acinar cells, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hohwieler et al. (2017)</xref> protocol, after 4 days of Phase III media, PPs were fed with Phase III base medium supplemented with with 20 ng/mL FGF10, 1&#x00B5;M XXI (Sigma Aldrich), 50 ng/mL Noggin, 10 mM Nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich), and 25 ng/mL Wnt3a (Peprotech) for seven days, daily feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hohwieler et al., 2017</xref>). More details about base medium formulation are described at <bold>Suppl. Table 1</bold>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Generation and Maintenance of iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Organoid Cultures</title>
<p>On the last day of Phase III, PPs were roughly dissociated via scraping and trituration. They were centrifuged at 170 x G for 3 minutes, and then resuspended with a solution composed of Phase III medium and Matrigel at a 1:4 ratio (1 of medium and 4 of Matrigel). 30 &#x00B5;L of this solution with cells was plated into each well of a 96 round bottom plate and then incubated at 37 &#x00B0;C for 20 minutes, before the plate was flipped upside down for 10 minutes. 100 &#x00B5;L of Phase III base medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL FGF10, 50 ng/mL Noggin, 10 mM Nicotinamide, and 25 ng/mL Wnt3a was then added to the cells. Cells were fed every other day with the same media until Day 57 or when organoids contained lumen and were at least 150 &#x00B5;m large.</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 stock</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2, isolate USA-WA1/2020, was obtained from the Biodefense and Emerging Infections (BEI) Resources of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Importantly, all studies involving SARS-CoV-2 infection of iPSC-derived pancreatic cells were conducted within a Biosafety Level 3 high containment facility at UCLA. SARS-CoV-2 was passed once in Vero-E6 cells and viral stocks were aliquoted and stored at &#x2013; 80 &#x00B0;C. Virus titer was measured in Vero-E6 cells by TCID50 assay. Vero-E6 cells were cultured in DMEM growth media containing 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, pen/step, and 10 mM HEPES. Cells were incubated at 37 &#x00B0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 infection of iPSC-derived pancreatic (iPan) cultures</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 viral inoculum (MOI of 0.05 and 0.1) was prepared using acinar or ductal cell specific media. Human iPSCs were differentiated into iPSC-derived pancreatic (iPan) cultures containing iPan<sup>ENDO</sup>, iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Acinar and iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Ductal cells in 96-well or 24-well plates before infection as detailed above, and the culture media at Day 26 of differentiation for iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Ductal and Day 16 for iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Acinar were replaced with 100 &#x03BC;l of prepared inoculum. For mock infection, cell type specific media (100 &#x03BC;l/well) alone was added. The inoculated plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37 &#x00B0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. At the end of incubation, the inoculum was replaced with fresh iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Acinar or iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Ductal culture medium. Cells remained at 37 &#x00B0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 hours (Day 1) or 72 hours (Day 3) before analysis. All studies involving active SARS-CoV-2 infection of iPSC-derived pancreatic cell cultures were conducted within a Biosafety Level 3 facility at University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA), CA, USA.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Immunofluorescence and imaging of cells</title>
<p>Cells subjected to immunofluorescence were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 minutes and subsequently washed with PBS.

<title>iPSC-derived pancreatic cells exhibit ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression</title>
<p>Human iPSCs were differentiated into pancreatic adherent (2D) and organoid (3D) cultures. Protocols for differentiation after the pancreatic progenitor stage were directed to bias the cell fate of the cultures containing either exocrine acinar cells (iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Acinar) or exocrine ductal cells (iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Ductal). iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Acinar cultures express some markers that are characteristic of mature acinar cultures such as cytoplasmic staining of digestive enzymes Amylase (AMY) and Chymotrypsin C (CTRC), and greater staining of nuclear transcription factor MIST1, which is characteristic of acinar cells that are not fully mature. In our cultures, cells that are AMY<sup>-</sup> are MIST1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, which indicates we have mixed cultures of acinar cells containing cells more mature and some less mature. Acinar cultures also contain some C-peptide expressing endocrine islet &#x03B2;-cells (iPan<sup>ENDO</sup>). iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Ductal cultures express cytoskeletal staining of Cytokeratin 19 (CK19). Interestingly, both AMY<sup>&#x002B;</sup> iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Acinar and CK19<sup>&#x002B;</sup> iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Ductal cultures exhibit ACE2 protein expression (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref></bold>), which is now a confirmed entry point receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, while coexpression is seen, not all AMY<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and C-peptide<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells express ACE2, and this seems partially to be consistent with current literature, which shows lower ACE2 expression in endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Coate et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kusmartseva et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>ACE2</italic> and <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> gene expression was also measured in pluripotent iPSC stage cells, iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures, human cadaveric pancreatic tissue, and human pancreatic duct epithelium cell line, H6C7.

<title>Transcriptional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures demonstrates active viral replication and pancreas-specific COVID-19 associated disease signatures</title>
<p>The iPan cultures containing iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Acinar and iPan<sup>ENDO</sup> cells infected with 0.1 MOI SARS-CoV-2 were harvested on Day 1 and Day 3 post-infection for transcriptomic analysis after mRNA sequencing, as well as cells that were not infected (mock conditions). After mapping genomic reads in infected cultures, mapped reads were detected from the SARS-CoV-2 genome that confirm active SARS-CoV-2 viral replication within infected cultures (<bold>Suppl. Table 3</bold>). Principal component analysis (PCA) of Day 1 and Day 3 infected cultures demonstrated that 37.9% and 41.1% of the variance in the gene expression differences could be attributed to principal component 1 (PC1) in Day 1 and Day 3 infected cultures, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). Both PCA and the heatmaps of differentially expressed genes clearly demonstrated transcriptomic clustering of samples in either the mock or infected condition in both days (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). Upon further interrogation of the Day 3 data, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced significant pancreas-specific gene expression changes within iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures including upregulation of <italic>PDX1, INS, GCG, CHGA, CFTR, IGFBP7</italic> and <italic>GHRL</italic> and downregulation of genes involved in cellular secretory pathway such as <italic>GOLGA8A</italic> and <italic>GOLGA8B</italic>. Significant changes in expression of chemokine and immunomodulatory genes were detected and most were upregulated such as <italic>PTGES, MIF, CCR7, CXCL6</italic> and <italic>CXCL12</italic>, which encodes immune cytokines known to be transcriptionally upregulated during SARS-CoV infection. Similarly, genes reflecting pathogenic interaction and antiviral responses in host cells such as <italic>THOC1, TRIM28, CD37, TRAF3IP1, DDX17, NCBP3, HYAL2</italic>, were also perturbed (<bold>Suppl Table 4</bold>). Gene enrichment pathway analysis confirmed significant upregulation of biological processes transcriptional pathways related to signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent translation and targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, viral transcription and viral gene expression (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>), consisting of mainly ribosomal complex large and small subunit genes. This is consistent with the idea that SARS-CoV-2 like many other viruses requires recruitment of a variety of host cell factors including ribosomal proteins to participate in viral protein biosynthesis, in order to survive, accumulate and propagate in the pancreatic cells. The most significant cellular components that are downregulated include nuclear body, nuclear specks and nucleoplasm (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>), which is also consistent with the downregulation of the specific nuclear pore complex (NPC) genes such as <italic>NPIPB3, 4, 5</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). Numerous viral pathogens have evolved different mechanisms to hijack the NPC in order to regulate trafficking of viral proteins, genomes and even capsids into and out of the nucleus thus promoting virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Le Sage and Mouland, 2013</xref>). As expected, the cytosolic ribosomal units are the most significantly upregulated cellular component (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). Notably, the virus perturbation signatures with SARS-CoV-2 in iPSC-derived pancreatic cells were similar to responses by previously published SARS-CoV, SARS-dORF6 and SARS-BatSRBD infection of human lung alveolar epithelium cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref></bold>) (Mitchell et al., 2013). Upon comparing COVID-19 associated transcripts published and available in the Enrichr database, similar signatures were significantly perturbed in SARS-CoV-2-infected iPan<sup>EXO</sup> Acinar, consistent with prior reports examining viral infection in pancreas (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces significant transcriptional changes within iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures.</p>

To better understand which cell types were infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the pancreas, cells were stained for specific endocrine and exocrine markers, such as Amylase and Chymotrypsin (CTRC) for acinar cells, Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) for ductal cells, and C-peptide for endocrine islet &#x03B2;-cells. Interestingly, many of the pancreatic cell types tested here co-localized with SARS-CoV-2-S. The virus was present in the majority of the CTRC<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and some clusters of Amylase<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref>)</bold>. However, as for the ductal population, SARS-CoV-2-S was not detected inCK19<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells <bold>(Suppl. Figure 5)</bold>. From the endocrine side, interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 staining was frequently concentrated in C-Peptide<sup>&#x002B;</sup> islet clusters <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<p>To examine whether the infected pancreatic tissues from COVID-19 patients may have differential expression of specific genes, snap-frozen post-mortem tissues from COVID-19 patients and Control subjects were assessed changes in expression of pancreas-specific genes. Interestingly, mRNA expression of ductal markers was increased in the COVID-19 samples, such as <italic>KRT19, CFTR, CA2</italic>, and <italic>HNF1B</italic> as seen in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>. Other pancreatic and inflammatory markers were also tested and although showed trends of perturbations, they were not statistically different between the groups likely due to the higher variability in this subset of COVID-19 patients (<bold>Suppl. Figure 6</bold>). These results from COVID-19 and Control human tissues corroborate our novel results in iPan cell cultures, where we show that both pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells can be infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the infection causes perturbations in pancreas-specific genes and the pancreatic cellular machinery.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this novel study, by observing gene and protein expression in live human iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures and post-mortem pancreatic tissue from COVID-19 patients in, we have described the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect pancreatic cells. Both approaches indicated that endocrine, acinar, and ductal cells within the pancreas are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These cell types are known to express the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transmembrane proteins recognized as the entry points for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Shang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Verdecchia et al., 2020</xref>). ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was observed as expected in the pancreatic cultures, thus providing an explanation for why pancreatic cells are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent clinical findings suggested pancreatic dysfunction following SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Apicella et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kusmartseva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). The iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures tested here were permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as demonstrated by viral antigen expression and genomic replication. The cell culture observations were supported by similar results in post-mortem pancreatic tissues from COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 presence was detected clearly in the pancreas of infected patients, specifically co-localizing in exocrine ductal and acinar cells, as well as endocrine &#x03B2;-cells. Co-infection with &#x03B2;-cells containing islet clusters in post-mortem patients was notable given that diabetes and related complications are considered independent risk factors associated with higher mortality rates in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Holman et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Upon assessing cellular and molecular perturbations in iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures, it was observed that SARS-CoV-2 infected ductal cells in culture were enlarged and the nuclear compartmentalization of the ductal-specific transcription factor SOX9, which is typically observed in normal ductal cells, was absent. Instead, a cytoplasmic staining pattern, suggesting a mislocalization of SOX9 as a potential indicator of cellular stress imposed by the virus in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chakravarty et al., 2011</xref>). The elongated morphology of the infected ductal cells is also a feature that is common in cancerous or inflamed epithelial cells converting to fibrotic cells undergoing a dynamic process known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kalluri and Weinberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Krantz et al., 2012</xref>). Pancreatic tissues from COVID-19 patients showed perturbation with upregulation of key ductal genes such as <italic>KRT19, CA2</italic> and <italic>CFTR</italic>. Increased <italic>KRT19</italic> expression is associated with pancreas-specific intracellular stress in patients with poor prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). Cytoskeletal protein responses are known to be dysregulated under conditions of intracellular stress imposed by a viral infection and similar disturbances have also been reported to be an important in both immune and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kopecki et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ong et al. 2020</xref>) Yet, further elucidation of the mechanisms of pancreatic injury involved in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection in pancreatic ductal cells is necessary.</p>
<p>In infected acinar cell cultures, the proinflammatory genes such as <italic>CXCL12</italic> were upregulated. This gene, in particular, was found expressed ten-fold in blood plasma by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), and is consistent with the overexpression of similar cytokines and chemokines widely seen during the cytokine storm frequently observed in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Coperchini et al., 2020</xref>; S<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">ong et al., 2020</xref>). Granular morphology was noted in all SARS-CoV-2 positive cells and could be representative of viral replication and transportation occurring in membrane vesicles. This would be consistent with previous findings that SARS-CoV-2 associates with the host endo membrane system, with 40% of SARS-CoV-2-interacting proteins having functions in the endomembrane system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Upon probing the pathways disrupted by SARS-CoV-2 upon infection of pancreatic cells, the most dramatic transcriptional change was the over-expression of transcriptional machinery and SRP-dependent protein-targeting processes. The transcripts contributing to these pathways were identified as hallmarks of viral replication by gene enrichment analysis. It has been previously reported that a common feature of coronaviruses is the use of virus-engineered double membrane vesicles from host cell components as a central site for viral RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Snijder et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wolff et al., 2020</xref>). The upregulation of SRP-protein targeting processes could be a reflection of host cell machinery being repurposed for viral replication. Conversely, the top three downregulated cellular components were nuclear. Other coronaviruses, including avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV), and SARS-CoV have been found to arrest cell cycle in the nucleus, leading to increased viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen and Makino 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dove et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yuan et al. 2006</xref>). Our results for the most upregulated and downregulated transcripts within the COVID-19-related Drug and Gene Set Library aligned with that of other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV and MHV, with the top two downregulated transcripts being SARS-CoV-2 related. Taken all together, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, elicits similar transcript-level signatures to promote viral replication in pancreatic cells. Future studies are necessary to confirm these mechanistic implications of these findings.</p>
<p>With this study, we provide novel patient-specific models for future mechanistic studies of SARS-CoV-2 impact on the pancreas This study supports the utility of iPSC-derived pancreatic cells as an excellent platform to explore the detrimental impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on pancreatic cells. Further, detailed studies are required to better understand and perhaps the 3D organoids and Organ-Chip systems can be utilized to explore the short-term and long-term detrimental effects SARS-CoV-2 has on the pancreas.</p>
