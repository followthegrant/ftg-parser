<title>Abstract</title>
<p>To evaluate the national effect of CDD on reducing road traffic mortality, we analyzed crude road traffic mortality rates data collected between 2006 and 2016 through China&#x2019;s National Disease Surveillance System. Linear regression models were fit with the pre-CDD data (2006-2011) and used to predict mortality rates in the post-CDD years (2012-2016). It is estimated that the new law was associated with 317,197 (95&#x0025; CI: 280,425&#x223C;353,968) lives saved in the entire country in the first 5-years of the new law. Similar reduction in mortality rates was observed in both urban and rural areas. The decline in non-occupants was more prominent and occurred earlier than that in occupants, among whom the road traffic mortality rate did not show a statistically significant reduction in the first 4 years of the new law. Our study shows that CDD is particularly effective in protecting non-occupants and is equally effective in both rural and urban areas in China.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Given the contribution of drink-driving to road traffic mortality in China, the Road Traffic Safety Law was revised in May 2011 to criminalize drink-driving (CDD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Since then driving with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 g/dl at a random breath test can be sentenced to 8-15 days in prison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. This is the first study to evaluate the national effect of CDD on reducing road traffic mortality, with particular focus on its protective effect on vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists who account for the majority of traffic deaths in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We analyzed crude road traffic mortality rates data collected between 2006 and 2016 through China&#x2019;s National Disease Surveillance System<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Road traffic mortality is referred to deaths caused by motor vehicle traffic accidents. Registered vehicles and population data were obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Linear regression models were fit with the pre-CDD data (2006-2011) and used to predict mortality rates in the post-CDD years (2012-2016). The difference between predicted and actual mortality rates were used as the estimate of the effect of the new law. This difference is multiplied by China&#x2019;s total population in a post-CDD year to estimate the number of lives saved in that year. Subgroup analyses by location (rural and urban) and type of road users (occupants and non-occupants) were also conducted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The road traffic mortality rate increased linearly as the number of registered vehicles increased in the pre-CDD years. Although the number of vehicles had been steadily growing, a sudden decline in the mortality rate started in 2011&#x223C;2012, the year immediately after the new law was introduced. Compared with the expected RTM rate, the actual mortality rate was lowered relatively by 4.92&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI: 1.60&#x0025;&#x223C;8.24&#x0025;) in the first year after the new law and by as much as 40.93&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI: 38.05&#x0025;&#x223C;43.82&#x0025;) 5 years later (2016). It is estimated that the new law was associated with 317,197 (95&#x0025; CI: 280,425&#x223C;353,968) lives saved in the entire country in the first 5-years of the new law.</p>
<p>Similar reduction in mortality rates was observed in both urban and rural areas. The decline in non-occupants was more prominent and occurred earlier than that in occupants, among whom the road traffic mortality rate did not show a statistically significant reduction in the first 4 years of the new law. Of the 317,197 lives saved, 84.66&#x0025; were pedal-cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians, and only 4.39&#x0025; were occupants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The concurrence of the decline in road traffic mortality rate and the launch of the new law indicates that legislation is likely effective in regulating risky driving behaviors. Although the national consumption of alcohol has increased since 1990<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, few drivers in China risk drink-driving now. This is also evidenced in the rising popularity of online designated driver service. A major limitation of this preliminary study is the before-and-after design. Potential confounding variables of this study include other road safety measures such as increased seat belt use that may also affect road traffic mortality rate. However, since the establishment of national seat belt law in 2004<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, there has been no new major regulations or laws regarding road safety other than CDD in the study period. Therefore, the sudden decline in traffic mortality in 2011 is most likely the result of CDD. As previously found in China, the road traffic mortality rate is disproportionately higher among non-occupants than car occupants, and is also higher in rural areas than urban ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Our study shows that CDD is particularly effective in protecting non-occupants and is equally effective in both rural and urban areas in China.</p>
