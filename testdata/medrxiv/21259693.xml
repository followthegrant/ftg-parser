<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Infection with SARS-CoV-2 portends a broad range of outcomes, from a majority of asymptomatic cases or mild clinical courses to a lethal disease. Robust correlates of severe COVID-19 include old age, male sex, poverty and co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes or cardiovascular disease. A precise knowledge is still lacking of the molecular and biological mechanisms that may explain the association of severe disease with male sex. Here, we show that testosterone trajectories are highly accurate individual predictors (AUC of ROC = 0.928, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001) of survival in male COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal determinations of blood levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and androstenedione suggest an early modest inhibition of the central LH-androgen biosynthesis axis in a majority of patients, followed by either full recovery in survivors or a peripheral failure in lethal cases. Moreover, failure to reinstate physiological testosterone levels was associated with evidence of impaired T helper differentiation and decrease of non-classical monocytes. The strong association of recovery or failure to reinstate testosterone levels with survival or death from COVID-19 in male patients is suggestive of a significant role of testosterone status in the immune responses to COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a diversity of clinical manifestations, including exacerbated inflammatory states accompanied with tissue and organ destruction beyond direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2. From the outset of the pandemic, it became clear that, while men and women present a similar prevalence of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, a higher risk of severe disease and death is significantly associated with male sex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Similar observations come from studies of outbreaks of pathogenic coronaviruses with SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), or other viral respiratory infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Multiple factors have been considered to explain the sex disparity observed in the development of severe COVID-19, including differential biological and pathophysiological impacts of age and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, obesity or active cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Sexual differences in disease severity are also observed in racial and ethnic minority groups, disproportionately affected by COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The underlying mechanisms that may account for these differences are not completely understood. As the main cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and the major viral fusogenic membrane-associated protease, TMPRSS2, are under transcriptional regulation by androgens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, it had been predicted that men would present a higher propensity of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and to develop more severe disease than women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, men and women show comparable risks of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and observational studies of male COVID-19 patients under androgen-deprivation therapy have yielded contrasting results with regards to risk of developing severe COVID-19 (ref. 9,10). Contrariwise, there is growing evidence that severe COVID-19 in male patients is accompanied with diminished levels of circulating testosterone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, suggesting a critical role for androgens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> in preventing the innate and/or adaptive immune dysfunctions that lead to the development of severe forms of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The sexual dimorphism of immune responses to pathogens has been long recognised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, pointing to women having stronger antiviral mechanisms, stronger T-regulatory cells, higher numbers of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), and superior immune-mediated tissue repair capacities as compared to men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, sex hormones may differentially impact the frequency and severity of many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, generally more prevalent in women than men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. It should be noted that sex hormones may exert apparently contrasting effects. For example, an immunosuppressive role for testosterone was observed in response to influenza vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, while testosterone supplementation following influenza infection in aged male mice, which caused decreased serum testosterone levels, reduced mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the relationship between testosterone status and disease severity, we have studied a population of male and female COVID-19 patients for serum and blood biomarkers in association with disease outcome, and have performed a longitudinal analysis in a sub-cohort of male patients. We have found that male patients who survive the disease eventually reinstate physiological levels of testosterone, while those who die from COVID-19 fail to do so. As such, we show that the trajectories of serum testosterone levels are highly accurate predictors of survival [area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve = 92.8&#x0025;, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001] in male COVID-19 patients, independent of associated co-morbidities or clinical management, and superior in predictive power to bloodlymphocyte or neutrophil counts. Furthermore, we have found that male COVID-19 patients with a fatal outcome display a late coordinated depletion of circulating subsets of differentiated CD4&#x002B; T lymphocytes and monocytes, mirrored by a relative enrichment of undifferentiated CD4&#x002B; T cells and monocytes.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>With the aim of exploring factors that may underlie the worse progression of COVID-19 in men, we have undertaken a retrospective study of 249 male and 248 female patients admitted to the Vall d&#x2019;Hebron Hospital between May1<sup>st</sup> and June 30<sup>th</sup> 2020, with RT-PCR-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were first studied for serum biochemical and hematological variables in samples collected at or near admission (first time point or Sample 1), for baseline assessment. Subsequently, a selected male population (114 patients) was studied for the progression of the disease by analyzing the same variables longitudinally, with serial time-point sample collection on average every 7 days. Samples from this patient subcohort were further analyzed for serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and androstenedione levels, as well as an extensive phenotyping of circulating immune cells.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Biochemical and hematological predictors of outcome in male and female COVID-19 patients</title>
<p>Biochemical and hematological parameters were analyzed at admission for 497 male and female patients. Demographics, background information and treatments are shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. SF1 and Tables ST1 and ST2. Patients were grouped according to their eventual outcomes at discharge/death into mild, moderate, severe-survivor and severe-deceased (Table ST3). In spite of the comparable overall age distributions in male and female patients (Fig. SF1), a higher proportion of female patients fell into the mild and moderate outcome groups (56&#x0025;) as compared to males (44&#x0025;). Conversely, a higher proportion of male patients fell into the severe-survivor and severe-deceased outcome groups (56&#x0025; and 58.46&#x0025;, respectively) as compared to female patients (44&#x0025; and 41.5&#x0025;). In both male and female patients, the median age severe-deceased outcome groups were significantly older than those in mild or moderate outcome groups, as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, women in the severe-deceased group were significantly older than males in the same outcome group (Fig. SF1).</p>

<p>As an approach to capture global patterns of association between biochemical parameters and outcomes, we applied principal component analysis (PCA), followed by Spearman multivariate correlation analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). In male patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), we observed a clear correlation between mild or moderate outcomes with known predictors of good outcome, such as higher lymphocyte counts or hemoglobin levels, while severe outcome groups correlated with low neutrophil counts, and high IL-6, CRP, D-dimer, ferritin or LDH levels, confirming abundant prior evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Patients with moderate outcomes had significantly lower serum testosterone levels compared to those with mild outcomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), in agreement with other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Additionally, severe outcome patients had significantly lower serum testosterone levels compared to those with mild or moderate outcomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Interestingly, the low testosterone levels found in the admission time-point determinations for both severe outcome groups were not significantly different between survivor and deceased patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Furthermore, older age presented a stronger correlation with a severe-deceased outcome than biochemical parameters predictive of poor outcome, such as D-dimer, ferritin, LDH or IL-6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), whereas the reverse was the case for correlations with a severe-survivor outcome, in which biochemical parameters were more strongly correlated with this group than age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>

<p>In female patients, PCA and multivariate analysis also highlighted significant differences between mild-moderate and severe outcome groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">d</xref>). Similar to male patients, the mild outcome group of female patients showed strong correlations to lymphocyte counts and hemoglobin levels, while the severe outcome groups were correlated with high IL-6, CRP, D-dimer, ferritin and LDH, (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">d</xref>). Mirroring male patients, older age showed the strongest correlation to a severe-deceased group in female patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Age, platelet counts and fibrinogen levels significantly discriminated severe-survivor from severe-deceased female patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">d</xref>).</p>
<p>The risk of ICU admission for patients with mild-moderate outcomes was assessed by odds ratio (OR) estimates and logistic regression analysis.

<p>The power of these parameters to predict severe disease was corroborated by multiple logistic regression analysis. The resulting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves yielded areas under the curve (AUC), which, in male patients, were &#x003E; 0.7 (<italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001) for IL-6, LDH and neutrophilia, and &#x003C; 0.23 for lymphopenia and testosterone.

<p>The same parameters showed a weaker power to predict risk of death from COVID-19, with the exception of serum IL-6 levels, in both male and female patients (OR 4.45, 95&#x0025; CI 2.14 &#x2013; 10.71 and AUC of ROC 0.7189, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002 for males; and females had OR 4.21 and AUC of ROC 0.7123, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0014 for females) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c, d</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, this baseline analysis reveals that critically low serum testosterone levels in male patients are a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Although other factors predictive of severity are in line with prior evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, our observations also suggest that, compared to age-matched female patients, male COVID-19 patients present a higher risk of progression to a severe-critical disease, with higher levels of inflammatory markers (serum IL-6, blood neutrophil counts) and tissue damage (LDH), and more marked lymphopenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Importantly, biochemical and hematological parameters determined at or near hospital admission do not reveal strong predictive markers of death from COVID-19, with the exception of serum IL-6 levels. A significant correlation of serum testosterone levels with lymphocyte (absolute counts, r = 0.3122; percentages of WBC, r = 0.4187) and neutrophil (r = -0.3586) counts suggests that these three parameters may be mutually coupled (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>

<title>Recovery of serum testosterone levels accurately predicts survival in male COVID-19 patients</title>
<p>In order to explore whether determinations in longitudinal samples later in the clinical course could yield additional or improved predictors of lethal disease, we followed the progression of a sub-cohort of 114 male COVID-19 patients, by analyzing samples procured at different time points after hospital admission. For patients in the severe outcome group, up to five time-point samples were analyzed. Patients in the combined mild-moderate outcome group were discharged, in average, after two weeks of admission and a maximum of three time-point samples were procured from them.</p>
<p>Trajectories for all clinical biochemistry and hematological parameters under consideration were plotted for all patients grouped into mild-moderate, severe survivor and severe deceased outcomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and Fig. SF3). Average values for each parameter were calculated for each time-point and linear regression applied.

</fig>
<p>The values of the slopes calculated from the linear regression of the trajectories of all parameters and patients were used in multiple logistic regression analysis to estimate their outcome predictive power. The resulting ROC curves and AUC values indicated that serum testosterone trajectories are remarkably accurate predictors of survival from COVID-19, both in all-survivor <italic>vs</italic>. deceased (AUC = 0.9281, 95&#x0025; CI 0.7216 to 0.9252, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001) and severe survivor <italic>vs</italic>. deceased outcome (AUC = 0.9205, 95&#x0025; CI 0.8664 to 0.9747, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001) comparisons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Lymphocyte counts (absolute numbers per dL or percentage of WBCs) were also highly accurate predictors of outcome, as were neutrophil counts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Interestingly, the trajectories of IL-6 or LDH, which values on admission were predictive of severity and death from COVID-19 in male patients, were not significantly different in these longitudinal comparisons (Fig. SF3).</p>
<p>Age is a factor predictor of COVID-19 severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In our cohort of male patients, the testosterone trajectory slopes significantly and inversely correlated with age (<italic>r</italic> = -0.3801, p &#x003C; 0.0001) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Consistently, a majority of patients with severe deceased outcomes had low or negative testosterone trajectory slopes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). However, and interestingly, the median age of patients with severe deceased outcomes was not significantly different from the median age of patients with mild-moderate outcomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), and a substantial proportion of patients with severe survivor outcomes were aged older than 60 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Likewise, while the frequency of comorbidities was higher among patients with fatal outcomes as compared with those who survived severe disease, it was not significantly different from the frequency of the moderate outcome group (Fig. SF1). This suggests that old age, with or without accompanying comorbidities, may impact the ability of a subset of COVID-19 patients to reinstate testosterone production, coupled to a failure to recover from the disease.</p>
<p>These results suggest a role for testosterone in deregulation of the immune response in deceased patients, in particular for the observed lymphopenia and neutrophilia.</p>

<title>The LH-androstenedione axis is not significantly perturbed in male COVID-19 patients</title>
<p>Testosterone is largely synthesized from cholesterol through androstenedione in the Leydig cells of the testis under the stimulus of luteinizing hormone (LH), secreted from the anterior portion of the pituitary gland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The observed critical decline in circulating testosterone levels in male COVID-19 patients suggests the occurrence of a transient (survivor outcomes) or sustained (fatal outcomes) hypogonadism following the onset of COVID-19, for which several causal mechanisms may be proposed. One possible mechanism is an inhibition of the LH-androstenedione axis, previously associated with non-specific critical illness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and the deleterious action on the hypophysis of inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> . A second possible mechanism may involve infection and damage by SARS-CoV-2 of testicular cells expressing ACE2, mainly Leydig cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In the first scenario, acute declines in LH and adrostenedione levels would be expected, while in the latter scenario they would be either unaffected or increased for LH due to a negative feedback loop with testosterone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We determined circulating LH and androstenedione levels in a longitudinal series of samples in a patient subcohort for which testosterone trajectories had been concomitantly determined, as described above. The median levels of LH were within normal ranges, independent of patient outcome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Similarly, longitudinal LH trajectories were not significantly different between patients in the survivor <italic>vs</italic>. deceased outcomes, in stark contrast with the strongly divergent testosterone trajectories (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Nevertheless, LH levels determined in the last of the longitudinal samples showed a decline in the deceased outcome group as compared to the severe survivor group, although without reaching statistical significance. On the other hand, although androstenedione levels fell within normal ranges in the majority of patients in all outcome groups and throughout the longitudinal analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, b</xref>), deceased patients showed an increase as compared to the survivor outcome groups, without a concomitant increase in testosterone levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). It should be noted that circulating androstenedione is produced mostly by adrenal glands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and its synthesis might be affected by the corticosteroids used to treat these patients that may block the endogenous production of cortisol, corticosterone and aldosterone, deviating the synthesis from cholesterol to androstenedione<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Therefore, the failure of patients with fatal outcomes to recover their physiological levels of testosterone in spite of LH and androstenedione levels within normal ranges suggests the development of an irreversible peripheral failure in the biosynthesis of testosterone in these patients. As such, an irreversible damage of Leydig cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> in patients with fatal outcomes could explain these observations, while a resolution of viral infection would explain the recovery of a normal production of testosterone in survivors.</p>

<title>Lethal male COVID-19 is associated with a depletion of circulating T helper cells</title>
<p>A number of studies have found substantial differences in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 between male and female patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, although the mechanisms underlying these differences are still unclear. In order to address the relationship between testosterone trajectories, outcome and immune status in male patients, we analyzed circulating immune subpopulation repertoires in a subset of our patient cohort, in at least two independent determinations, separated by 5-20 days.</p>
<p>Principal component analyses (PCA) pointed to a correlation between immune subpopulations, outcome and testosterone levels both in a first determination of samples near admission date (Sample 1) and a subsequent analysis of samples near discharge or death date (Sample 2), with some subpopulations showing remarkable shifts between Sample 1 and Sample 2 in their correlations with outcome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, b</xref>). As such, Sample 1 determinations demonstrated relatively few changes in immune cell repertoires between surviving and deceased patients. In stark contrast, a subsequent determination (Sample 2) showed a coordinated depletion of T helper subpopulations in association with death, along with changes in natural killer (CD56<sup>&#x002B;</sup>brightCD16<sup>-</sup> and CD56<sup>&#x002B;</sup>dimCD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) and monocyte subpopulations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). The subpopulations with the most significant changes in relative abundance as a function of outcome tended to correlate with serum testosterone levels sampled in the same period (1-3 days from sampling for immune repertoire analyses) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>These correlations were more evident in multivariate correlation analyses, particularly for Sample 2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). These analyses show a generalized loss of representation of circulating CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> central memory, CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> effector memory, CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> TEMRA) and T helper (Th) T lymphocyte subpopulations (Th1, Th17, Th1-Th17, Th2) in deceased patients compared to surviving patients, accompanied with a reciprocal increased representation of na&#x00EF;ve CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell compartments (recent thymus emigrant (RTE) CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, na&#x00EF;ve CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD45RA<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b-d</xref>). They also point to an association of monocyte differentiation with outcome, with a predominant correlation with non-classical monocytes in moderate and severe survivor patients and, conversely, with more pro-inflammatory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> classical monocytes in deceased patients (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b-d</xref>). There are additional associations of cytotoxic T cell (particularly diminished CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> effector memory) or B cell subpopulations (diminished transitional B cells and augmented representation of plasmabasts) with lethal COVID-19 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 d-f</xref>), albeit without reaching statistical significance. These correlations are made more evident when comparing all surviving patients (moderate and severe survivor) with deceased patients (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>), and further illustrated by flow cytometry histograms of representative cases (Fig. SF4).</p>
<p>Together, these observations indicate that male COVID-19 patients with a lethal outcome suffer from a decline in circulating effector T helper cells accompanied with a relative enrichment in circulating na&#x00EF;ve CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells. These selective imbalances in immune subpopulations in association with fatal outcomes are in line with other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and suggest a defective transition from undifferentiated to differentiated T helper cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and classical to non-classical monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, an altered leucocyte recirculation dynamics with effect on na&#x00EF;ve/effector T lymphocyte balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, or exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> of differentiated effector T helper cells and non-classical monocytes. Failure to recover from such imbalances is paralleled by a failure to reinstate physiological levels of testosterone and is associated with a lethal outcome in male patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Numerous studies have identified prognostic markers able to discern severe COVID-19 patients, including older age, male sex, co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes or cardiovascular disease, elevated circulating markers of inflammation, lymphopenia, neutrophilila<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, or the presence of autoantibodies to class-I interferons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Nomograms or scores that combine several independent parameters have been proposed as predictors of COVID-19 outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, relatively few studies have addressed sex differences in predictive markers of disease outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Interestingly, inflammation markers, but not co-morbidities, BMI or age have been found to be associated with outcome differences between male and female COVID-19 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our comparative analysis of biochemical and hematological parameters has revealed that both sexes share markers with significant predictive power of disease outcome, including IL-6, LDH, D-dimer, lymphopenia and neutrophilia, although the levels of these markers, and the strength of their predictive power, are consistently higher in male patients as compared to female patients. This becomes more evident when evaluating predictive markers of lethal COVID-19, which yields IL-6 and lymphocyte (percentage of total WBC) as the only two significantly predictive markers shared in both male and female patients. Other significant markers predictive of lethal COVID-19 in male, but not female, patients are LDH levels, neutrophilia and absolute lymphocyte counts, in addition to testosterone levels, which are exclusively masculine in our patient cohorts. These observations suggest that male COVID-19 patients with severe and lethal disease suffer from more deleterious underlying pathogenic and inflammatory processes than female patients with comparable clinical severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, a situation also observed in other respiratory viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, markers of inflammation (IL-6, CRP) or tissue damage (LDH), with good outcome predictive power in first sample determinations, lost their predictive power in longitudinal analyses of samples in male patients, collected up to the time of discharge or fatality. In contrast, testosterone levels, whose determinations on admission provided relatively modest outcome predictive power, corroborating other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, gained remarkable levels of significance when analyzed longitudinally. The AUC values of ROC curves in multiple logistic regression analyses (mild-moderate <italic>vs</italic>. severe: 0.9281, 95&#x0025; CI 0.7216 to 0.9252, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001; severe survivor <italic>vs</italic>. deceased: 0.9205, 95&#x0025; CI 0.8664 to 0.9747, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.0001) indicate that serum testosterone trajectories in longitudinal determinations constitute, to the best of our knowledge, the most accurate independent predictors of disease outcome in male COVID-19 patients described so far. Furthermore, longitudinal trajectories of lymphocyte and neutrophil counts also yield highly significant predictions of disease outcome.</p>
<p>Other biochemical parameters indicative of pathological inflammatory or pro-coagulant states, such as elevated IL-6, CRP or D-dimer levels, eventually return to near-physiological levels in both survivors and patients with fatal outcomes. This has been observed in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, and suggests that the normalization of these factors is insufficient, <italic>per se</italic>, to abate the pathological hyperinflammation and hypercoagulation accompanying severe COVID-19 with a fatal outcome, which would require the concomitant alleviation of lymphopenia and neutrophilia. On the other hand, although different stimuli and conditions such as mechanical ventilation, muscle immobilization, severe sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction as well as neuro/myotoxic agents may contribute to a critical status amongst patients admitted to ICU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, all severe patients in our study, with either survivor or deceased outcomes, were under comparable pharmacological and physical management (Tables ST1 and ST2).</p>
<p>A relevant factor associated with late-onset hypogonadism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, as well as with an irreversible failure to reinstate testosterone production after critical situations that may compromise the LH-androstenedione axis is old age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, which has been linked to senescent dysfunction of Leydig cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. The fact that a majority of non-survivor patients in our study who failed to reinstate testosterone levels are older than 60 years of age would be consistent with the senescence hypothesis. However, our cohort has more patients older than 60 who reinstated their testosterone levels and survived severe COVID-19. Therefore, either Leydig cell senescence only affects a small subset of older patients, or other mechanisms may be invoked to explain failure to restore testosterone production.</p>
<p>Conversely, these observations also suggest that, while the reinstatement of physiological testosterone levels may be mechanistically linked to a return to lymphocyte and neutrophil homeostasis, it may not be required for the relative normalization of other inflammatory pathways, arguably driven by an unmitigated production of IL-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines triggered by acute viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. In this regard, IL-6 can be produced by a broad range of cells, beyond immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, in response, or not, to production of IL-1 &#x03B2; or IL-18 by epithelial or endothelial cells through viral activation of the inflammasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, aided by viral blunting of class I and III interferon pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Pro-inflammatory actions of cytokines such as IL-6 are the main inducers of the production of CRP in the liver during infectious and inflammatory processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, and can independently trigger the activation of coagulation pathways, explaining the rise in blood D-dimer levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, as well as complement pathways, which, coupled to direct viral cytopathic effects, explains the elevated circulating levels of tissue damage markers such as LDH and a further exacerbation of a pro-coagulant state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. As such, an eventual control of viral replication is expected to lead to a return of these pathways to homeostasis. However, our observations suggest that sufficient and timely resolution of pathogenic hyperinflammation to prevent a lethal outcome may require the additional return to homeostasis of innate and/or adaptive immune cell dynamics and function, possibly assisted in male patients by reinstatement of testosterone production.</p>
<p>There is now a wealth of studies describing the dynamics of immune responses to acute and subacute infection with SARS-CoV-2, including multiparameter and functional analyses of circulating and tissue-associated innate and adaptive immune subpopulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Some of these studies have addressed sex differences in such responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Our analysis in male patients indicates an association of specific immune subpopulations with COVID-19 outcome and a shift of such associations from early (Sample 1) to late (Sample 2) time-points in the course of the disease. For example, the relative representation of terminally differentiated (CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> TEMRA, CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> TEMRA) and activated (CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup>HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup>HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) T cell subpopulations and differentiating B cells modestly correlated with all outcomes except mild disease in Sample 1. This indicates an ongoing early immune response of similar nature and magnitude, regardless of final outcome, as reported by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. In this phase, non-classical monocytes are present in patients with a moderate outcome, while patients with severe survivor and severe deceased outcomes show a predominance of more inflammatory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> classical monocytes, in support of a more inflammatory state of these patients, as also evidenced by the clinical biochemical and hematological parameters discussed above.</p>
<p>However, later in the course of disease (Sample 2), a remarkable shift takes place, in particular with regards to correlations with severe survivor as compared to severe deceased patients. As such, while patients with severe survivor outcomes show positive correlations with terminally differentiated (CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> TEMRA, CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> TEMRA), activated (HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup> on CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and on CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) and memory (CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> central memory, CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> central memory) T cell subpopulations, patients with eventual fatal outcomes evidence a depletion of these subpopulations along with an accumulation of undifferentiated T helper cells (recent thymic emigrant CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and na&#x00EF;ve CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup>). This late shift also affects innate immune populations, as severe survivor patients now correlate with non-classical monocytes over classical monocytes, while the reverse is the case for severe deceased patients. Similar observations have been made by others in studies correlating innate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and adaptive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> immune cell subpopulations to COVID-19 outcome.</p>
<p>Importantly, our study additionally correlates relative representations of immune subpopulations to testosterone levels. Thus, higher testosterone levels in Sample 1 are correlated to polarized (Th1, Th17, Th1-17, Th2) and differentiated (CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> effector memory, CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> central memory, CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> TEMRA) T cell subpopulations, and in Sample 2 to a similar range of subpopulations, along with plasmablasts and mature NK cells (CD16<sup>&#x002B;dim</sup>CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup>). These temporal switches in the differentiation profiles of distinct immune subpopulations may suggest that, in patients with lethal outcomes, there may be a defective skewing of T helper cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and monocytes. A second possible explanation of the apparent depletion of circulating differentiated and polarized cells may be an enhanced clearance or migration from circulation to peripheral tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Finally, specific subpopulations may become exhausted in late stages of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. These three putative mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and may take place either simultaneously or dynamically at different time points along the clinical course of the patients.</p>
<p>The observed concordance of lethal outcome in male COVID-19 patients with (i) persistent lymphopenia and neutrophilia, (ii) depletion of circulating differentiated T helper and T cytotoxic cells and non-classical monocytes, (iii) accumulation of na&#x00EF;ve immune counterparts, and (iv) failure to reinstate physiological levels of testosterone, mirrored by converse phenotypes in severe survivor patients who have undergone equivalent critical illness and management, makes it appealing to hypothesize a mechanistic relationship bonding these coincident phenotypes.</p>
<p>Sex hormones have a profound influence on innate and adaptive immune system development, differentiation and response to challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> More specifically, androgens have a global anti-inflammatory effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, reflected in higher frequencies of autoimmune diseases in women or in acquired or genetically determined hypogonadism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, as compared to men with a normal XY chromosome complement. On the other hand, testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal men attenuates inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> and androgens suppress thymic precursor development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> and promote the terminal differentiation of T cell subpopulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> and monocyte precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Conversely, androgen deprivation through surgical or pharmacological castration in animal models prompts the regeneration of the thymus in aged mice, leading to a relative accumulation of na&#x00EF;ve T cell populations (RTE and na&#x00EF;ve T cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> and classical monocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. A similar effect of androgen deprivation on T cell development and differentiation has been observed in prostate cancer patients, with an expansion of RTE and naive T cells, particularly among CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To sum up, the tight association between reinstatement of testosterone and survival from COVID-19 in male patients, along with a reversal of signs of excessive inflammation and immune dysfunction, suggests a functional role for testosterone, beyond being a mere biomarker of outcome, in such recovery.</p>
<p>The limitations of our study include its observational nature on retrospective patients and samples, which has precluded the collection of samples at precisely equivalent time points after symptom onset for all patients. This has most notably impacted longitudinal studies of immune populations which, in the present study, was limited to two temporally separate determinations per male patient studied. A follow-up study is currently ongoing aimed at expanding the present study in this regard, including longitudinal analyses in women. On the other hand, several hypotheses laid out here would require formal testing by means of approaches that are not addressed in the present study. For example, the various mechanisms postulated to explain the depletion of circulating differentiated effector T cells in lethal COVID-19 patients would benefit from additional analyses of senescent and activation states of such populations with appropriate markers, as well as detailed analyses of viral infection and immune cell populations infiltrating key tissues, mainly lung and testis. Finally, pre-clinical animal models would be required for a robust experimental demonstration of mechanistic relationships between testosterone status (e. g., deprivation and replacement) and SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes, which should also contemplate factors such as age.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>We studied a group of patients with COVID-19 (249 men and 248 women) admitted at the Vall d&#x2019;Hebron Hospital between May 1<sup>st</sup> through June 30<sup>th</sup> 2020. All patients were diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time RT-PCR quantitation of viral ORF1a and nucleocapsid RNAs, performed on samples from nasopharyngeal swabs. The frequency distribution relative to age in males and females is illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1. Co-morbidities considered were: chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, HIV infection with good adherence, obesity (BMI &#x2265; 30) and cancer. Previously hospitalized patients, recently transplanted, immunosuppressed, and hormonally depleted patients were excluded from the study. A sub cohort of 114 male patients, including patients that entered the intensive care unit (ICU), were selected for longitudinal analysis. The present study was performed with surplus serum samples from routinely tested hospitalized COVID-19 patients, following a protocol reviewed and approved by the Hospital Vall d&#x2019;Hebron Institutional Review Board (Medical Research Ethics Committee, protocol number PR(AG)329-2020).</p>
<p>Immunophenotyping studies of peripheral blood cells underwent a separate review and approval process (protocol number PR(AG)242/2020).</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Clinical data, demographics, co-morbidities, hospital admission, discharge, death dates, time from symptoms onset to hospitalization, length of hospital stay, treatments, requirement for oxygen support, and ICU requirement, were collected from the Hospital database. For reference analyses (497 patients, males and females), data were obtained at (near) hospital admission date. For longitudinal analysis, a sub-cohort (114) of male patients were analyzed throughout the hospitalization.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Serological determinations</title>
<p>Serum biochemical variables were measured by automated analyzers at the Core Laboratory Facility at the Biochemistry Service of the Vall d&#x2019;Hebron Hospital. Serum hormones were measured as described in Supplementary Materials. All determinations for the patient population were compared to internal controls used for reference ranges at our core laboratory. Serum hormone levels were determined by chemiluminiscent immunoassays (CLIA) on an AtellicaTM IM Analyzer (Siemens Inc., NY), using Testosterone TSTII (Siemens ref. 10995707) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) (Siemens ref. 10995634) kits. Androstenedione was measured on a LIASON XL Analyzer (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy), using the LiasonR Androstenedione (ref. 318870) assay. As references for healthy men, we used median total serum testosterone levels of 409.72 ng/dL (CI 90 197.44-669.58) for &#x003C; 50 yrs, and 377.46 ng/dL (CI 90 187.72-684.19) for &#x003E; 50 years (FDA-approved protocol, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K191533.pdf">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K191533.pdf</ext-link>). For luteinizing hormone (LH), the reference median values were 2.8 mIU/mL (CI 1.5-9.3 mIU/mL) for &#x003C; 70yrs, and 8.0 mIU/mL (range 3.1-34.6 mIU/mL) for &#x003E; 70 years. For androstenedione, the reference median value was 1.80 ng/mL (range 0.5-3.5 ng/mL).</p>

<title>Immuno-phenotyping</title>
<p>Blood was collected in vacutainer tubes containing ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) as anticoagulant (BD-Plymouth, PL6 7BP, UK) and processed within 4 h after collection. Absolute counts and relative numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined for all study participants using tetra CHROME Tube 1 (CD45-FITC/CD4-PE/CD8-ECD/CD3-PC5) and tetraCHROME Tube 2 (CD45-FITC/CD56-PE/CD19-ECD/CD3-PC5) (Beckman Coulter (BC)) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Samples were fixed in 1X lysing solution (BC) and acquired on a BC Navios EX instrument.</p>
<p>For multicolor staining and analysis, extended lymphocyte subpopulations were assessed with 5 different flow cytometry panels designed according to the HIPC protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Two additional panels were added to analyze the basic lymphocyte populations and RTE. Compensation controls were used in each panel to avoid overlapping of the different fluorochromes. Gating strategies were as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, and the antibody panels are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Panel 1: General immune phenotype of T, B, and natural killer (NK) lymphocyte subpopulations, gating by CD45 versus SSC.</p>
<p>Panel 2: Gating strategy for differentiated CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T-cell subsets, based on CD45RA and CCR7 expression defining: CD45RA<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/CCR7<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (na&#x00EF;ve), CD45RA<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/CCR7<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (central memory [TCM]), CD45RA<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/CCR7<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (effector memory [TEM]), and CD45RA<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/CCR7<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (terminal effector memory [TEMRA]). CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T-helper (Th) populations (Th1, Th2, Th17, Th1&#x2013;17), based on CCR6 and CXCR3 expression, were analyzed by gating on CD45RA&#x2212; TCM and TEM cells.</p>
<p>Panel 3: T-regulatory (Treg) cell populations: CD3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, CD127<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, CCR4<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, and CD45RO<sup>&#x002B;</sup>.</p>
<p>Panel 4: B-cell populations (na&#x00EF;ve, pre-switched, switched memory, and exhausted) depending on expression of IgD and CD27. The differing pattern of CD24<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD38<sup>&#x002B;</sup> expression identified transitional cells and plasmablasts. CD27 and CD21 enabled study of the CD21low population.</p>
<p>Panel 5: Dendritic cells (DC), NK cells, and monocyte populations were analysed in the CD3<sup>&#x2212;</sup>CD19<sup>&#x2212;</sup>gate. NK subpopulations (NK dim and NK bright) were studied using CD56 and CD16 expression. The markers CD16 and CD14 were used to identify classical monocytes (CD14<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD16<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) and non-classical monocytes (CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD14<sup>&#x2212;</sup>). DCs were studied selecting the population negative for the following markers: CD3, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20, and CD56. High expression of HLA-DR and CD11c and CD123 was used to identify plasmacytoid DCs (HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD123<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) and myeloid DCs (HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x002B;</sup>).</p>
<p>Panel 6: Recent thymic emigrant cells (RTEs) were studied using CD3, CD4, CD27, CD31, CD45RA, and CD62L expression.</p>
<p>The composition of mAb mixes, concentrations, clones, and brands are specified in Supplementary Table ST4. The samples were acquired with a NAVIOS EX (BC) flow cytometer. At least 100,000 events were acquired from each sample. Flow cytometry data were analysed with Kaluza Software. Internal quality assurance procedures were performed according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Absolute values were calculated from the absolute number of leucocytes and lymphocytes provided by the haematological analyser (XN-2000; Sysmex, Japan).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Continuous variables were expressed as mean &#x00B1; SD or median and interquartile range (IQR). Simple and multiple comparisons were performed using parametric (Student&#x2019;s t-test or ANOVA) and non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal&#x2013; Wallis) statistical tests with Dunn&#x2019;s and Tukey&#x2019;s post hoc tests. Categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages and compared using the 2-test of the Fisher exact test as appropriate. ROC curves were calculated with the logistic regression model implemented in STATA 14 and the EasyROC web tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/easyROC/">http://www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/easyROC/</ext-link>), Odd Ratios (OR) were calculated by transforming areas under the curve (AUC) with the Effect Size Converter web tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.escal.site/">https://www.escal.site/</ext-link>). Principal Component Analysis (PCA), multivariate correlation analysis and other calculations, as well as graphic representations, were performed with GraphPad Prism 9.0.2.</p>
