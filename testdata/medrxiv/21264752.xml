<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving stressor with significant mental health consequences. We aimed to delineate distinct anxiety-response trajectories during the early stages of the pandemic and to identify baseline risk and resilience factors as predictors of anxiety responses.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Using a crowdsourcing website, we enrolled 1,362 participants, primarily from the United States (n = 1064) and Israel (n = 222) over three time-points from April-September 2020. We used latent growth mixture modeling to identify anxiety trajectories over time. Group comparison and multivariate regression models were used to examine demographic and risk and resilience factors associated with class membership.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>A four-class model provided the best fit. The resilient trajectory (stable low anxiety) was the most common (n = 961, 75.08&#x0025;), followed by chronic anxiety (n = 149, 11.64&#x0025;), recovery (n = 96, 7.50&#x0025;) and delayed anxiety (n = 74, 5.78&#x0025;). While COVID-19 stressors did not differ between trajectories, resilient participants were more likely to be older, living with another person and to report higher income, more education, fewer COVID-19 worries, better sleep quality, and more dispositional resilience factors at baseline. Multivariate analyses suggested that baseline emotion regulation capabilities and low conflictual relationships uniquely distinguished participants in distinct trajectories.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Consistent with prior resilience research following major adversities, a majority of individuals showed stable low levels of low anxiety in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge about dispositional resilience factors may prospectively inform mental health trajectories early in the course of ongoing adversity.</p>

<body>
<p>At the end of January 2021, a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly 100 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, including more than 2 million deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wold Health Organization, 2021</xref>). The rapidly evolving situation contributed to compulsory measures that have drastically altered people&#x2019;s lives worldwide, with substantial potential impacts on health and wellbeing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cusinato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Evanoff et al., 2020</xref>). There has also been widespread attention paid to the evolving longitudinal burden on population-wide mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gordon &#x0026; Borja, 2020</xref>), highlighting the urgent need to improve our understanding of the variability in mental health responses during and following COVID-19.</p>
<p>Prior research suggests that the majority of people exhibit stable levels of functioning after exposure to various forms of acute adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mancini, Bonanno, &#x0026; Clark, 2011</xref>), including after outbreaks of high-risk infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bonanno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bults et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Leung et al., 2005</xref>). However, stress responses typically show substantial individual variation (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Bonanno &#x0026; Mancini, 2012</xref>), and thus it is critical to account for inter-individual variability in response to COVID-19 stress. The empirical literature suggests that this variability can be captured by a relatively small set of prototypical outcome trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonanno 2004</xref>). The most common trajectory of resilience is characterized by a relatively stable trajectory of healthy functioning even soon after an acute stressor. By contrast, a recovery pattern is distinguished by elevated symptoms and a gradual return to normal levels of functioning, while chronic distress is characterized by elevated symptoms that persist. Finally, delayed distress is characterized by moderate to elevated symptoms that worsen over time. Given that the effect of COVID-19 on mental health will depend on a wide variety of individual and contextual factors, it is critical to use techniques that can identify these individually varying response patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mancini, 2020</xref>). However, relatively few studies have examined individual variability in response to the pandemic&#x2019;s early stress, when anxiety and uncertainty may have been most acute.</p>
<p>In addition to variation at the individual level, the pandemic itself has undergone rapid and unstable changes in virus spread leading to both imposition and relaxation of government restrictions, which together may have affected mental health trajectories since the predictability and capacity to control a stressor are critical to individual adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cheng, Lau, &#x0026; Chan, 2014</xref>). Longitudinal studies using pre-pandemic data suggested negative effects on mental health symptoms during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Shi et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Xiong et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ma et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barzilay et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kwong et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pierce et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vindegaard and Eriksen Benros 2020</xref>) and a few longitudinal studies conducted at the early stages of the pandemic (March to May) demonstrated an increase in psychological distress, with elevated rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">O&#x2019;Connor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ruggieri, Ingoglia, Bonfanti, &#x0026; Lo Coco, 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, later and more recent reports suggested that anxiety symptoms subsequently declined or were small in magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Daly, Sutin, &#x0026; Robinson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McGinty, Presskreischer, Anderson, Han, &#x0026; Barry, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prati &#x0026; Mancini, 2021</xref>) and even recovered to pre-pandemic levels (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Daly &#x0026; Robinson, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Robinson &#x0026; Daly, 2020</xref>). Taken together, it remains unclear how mental health trajectories during the pandemic have evolved over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mancini, 2020</xref>). Thus, there remains a critical need for longitudinal studies of adjustment during the early stages of COVID-19 using data with sufficient baseline phenotyping to allow for identification of factors that contribute to both resilient and adverse mental health trajectories.</p>
<p>In the current study, we sought to address these knowledge gaps while overcoming traditional challenges in resilience research by integrating both trait and outcome approaches. Specifically, we assessed dispositional resilience factors at baseline and then assessed their capacity to account for individual variation in resilient and other trajectories of adjustment. We used data collected through a research crowdsourcing website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barzilay et al., 2020</xref>) that allowed for (1) longitudinal modeling of mental health trajectories over time using repeated assessment of anxiety symptoms; (2) identification of a trajectory of healthy functioning and positive adaptation after exposure to adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonanno, 2004</xref>); and (3) examination of baseline risk and resilience factors that may have contributed to belonging to each trajectory. We included a multidimensional assessment of resilience factors using a battery that probed intrapersonal, interpersonal, and social environment characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Moore et al., 2020</xref>), in accordance with widely accepted method encouraging a multi-level approach to evaluate both an individual&#x2019;s traits and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cicchetti &#x0026; Curtis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Luthar, Cicchetti, &#x0026; Becker, 2000</xref>). We explored the possibility that; (1) participants would belong to heterogeneous subpopulations that comprised distinct anxiety response trajectories over time, with a resilient trajectory being the most prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Leung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mancini et al., 2011</xref>); and (2) resilience and risk factors would be associated with individually-varying trajectories. We were particularly interested in identifying whether demographic factors, COVID-19 stressors and worries, and dispositional resilience factors predicted participant&#x2019;s trajectories membership.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>On April 6th 2020, we launched a website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.covid19resilience.org/">https://www.covid19resilience.org/</ext-link>) that included a resilience survey, assessment of COVID-19-related stress (worries) and mental health screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barzilay et al., 2020</xref>). At the end of the survey, participants received feedback on their resilience scores with personalized recommendations regarding stress management. The feedback functioned to incentivize participants to complete the survey carefully. Following the feedback, participants were asked if they are interested in being re-contacted for future surveys. The study was advertised through: 1) Researchers&#x2019; social networks, including emails to colleagues around the world; 2) Social media; 3) The University of Pennsylvania and Children&#x2019;s Hospital of Philadelphia internal notifications and websites; and 4) Organizational mailing lists. All participants consented to participate in the study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Analyses included 1,392 participants above the age of 18 who had completed at least two out of three time points for the anxiety screening: T1, April 6th to May 10th, <italic>n</italic> = 1289; T2, May 12<sup>th</sup> to July 6th, <italic>n</italic> = 1,200; and T3, August 25<sup>th</sup> to - September 27<sup>th</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 914. Overall, 448 participants had T1 and T2 data only, 162 had T1 and T3 only and 73 had T2 and T3 data only. Six hundred and seventy-nine participants, 49.8&#x0025;, had complete data across all three time points and 50.2&#x0025; had data available for at least 2 time-points.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="s1b1">
<title>Anxiety symptoms</title>
<p>Participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, a self-report scale developed to assess the defining symptoms of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &#x0026; L&#x00F6;we, 2006</xref>). The items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale (from 0&#x25A1;=&#x25A1;not at all to 3&#x25A1;=&#x25A1;nearly every day) and scores ranged from 0 to 21. In the current study, the Cronbach&#x2019;s alpha coefficient of the GAD-7 was .89 at T1, .92 at T2 and .92 at T3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b2">
<title>COVID-19-related worries</title>
<p>Participants indicated the degree to which they were worried about a variety of COVID-19 related outcomes on 5-point Likert scale (0 = Not at all; 4 = a great deal). Worries included: 1) Contracting COVID-19; 2) Dying from COVID-19; 3) Family members contracting COVID-19; 4) Unknowingly infecting others with COVID-19; 5) Currently having COVID-19; 6) Having significant financial burden because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b3">
<title>COVID-19-related stressors</title>
<p>Participants were asked to rate whether they had experienced the following: 1) Testing positive for COVID-19; 2) knowing someone who died from COVID-19; 3) job loss since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic; and 4) reduced pay since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. These variables were scored as Yes = 1 (experienced), No = 0 (not experienced). The stressors were summed for a Cumulative stressors measure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b4">
<title>Pre-existing anxiety diagnosis</title>
<p>Participants were asked whether they had received a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (1 = yes, 0 = no).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b5">
<title>Sleep measure</title>
<p>Participants completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a 7-item assessment of insomnia symptoms over the prior two weeks, with items rated on a scale ranging from 0 (No problems) to 4 (Very Severe) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Morin, Belleville, B&#x00E9;langer, &#x0026; Ivers, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b6">
<title>Self-reported resilience factors</title>
<p>The survey included 21 items assessing resilience factors that were recently compiled into a single battery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barzilay et al., 2020</xref>). The questions were selected from a larger set of 212 items using factor analysis followed by computerized adaptive test simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Moore et al., 2020</xref>). The survey included five subscales of resilience factors: self-reliance (3 items; e.g., can usually find a way out of difficult situations), with items coded on a 7-point Likert Scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree); emotion regulation (5 items; difficulty concentrating or controlling behaviors when upset, limited access to emotion regulation strategies), with items coded on a 5-point Likert Scale (1 = almost always [91-100&#x0025;] to 5 = almost never [0-10&#x0025;]); characteristics of close relationships: positive (4 items on supportive close relationships; e.g., lasting relationship and level of care) and negative (5 items on hostility in relationships; e.g., level of arguing), with items coded on a 5-point Likert Scale (1 = little or none to 5 = the most);); and perceptions of the neighborhood environment (4 items; e.g., perceived level of trust and safety in neighborhood), with items coded on an 5-point Likert Scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). To maximize interpretability, we coded all items such that a higher score indicated greater resilience.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="s1c">
<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>To address our first study aim, we applied latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) to the anxiety scores at T1, T2, and T3 and compared model fit for solutions with one to five classes (Bengt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Muth&#x00E9;n, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nylund, Asparouhov, &#x0026; Muth&#x00E9;n, 2007</xref>). All analyses were conducted in Mplus version 8 (<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">Muth&#x00E9;n &#x0026; Muth&#x00E9;n, 2017</xref>) using a robust full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation procedure for handling missing data which assumes missing data are unrelated to the outcome variable (i.e., missing at random) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Enders, 2001</xref>). We considered multiple criteria to evaluate model fit, including the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Lo&#x2013;Mendell&#x2013;Rubin adjusted Likelihood Ratio Test, and entropy values (B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Muth&#x00E9;n, 2004</xref>; Bengt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Muth&#x00E9;n, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nylund et al., 2007</xref>). We also evaluated the substantive meaning of class solutions relative to theoretical accounts and prior findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bonanno, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bonanno, Westphal, &#x0026; Mancini, 2011</xref>). We initially compared fit for unconditional models without covariates using conventional indices that penalize more complex models when they fail to provide a better fit to the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lo, 2001</xref>; Bengt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Muth&#x00E9;n, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nylund et al., 2007</xref>). However, consistent with recommendations, we then included covariates as predictors of class membership in conditional models. Covariates were age, sex, education, income, living alone, and living in the US. This step is recommended because non-significant relationships between covariates and class membership may indicate an incorrect local solution (Bengt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Muth&#x00E9;n, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>We next compared demographic factors, COVID-19 stressors and COVID-19 worries between the anxiety trajectory classes. We first used univariate ANOVA to compare the derived trajectory groups on a variety of demographic factors (age, gender, race, income, education, living alone, and living in the US). We then used multinomial logistic regression models to test whether T1 COVID-19 stressors (e.g., testing positive, knowing someone who died) and worries (i.e., worries about contracting, financial burden of the pandemic) predicted class membership controlling for demographic variables. Finally, we used multinomial logistic regression models to test whether T1 resiliency (e.g., emotion regulation, harmony in close relationships) or risk (e.g., prior anxiety diagnosis of anxiety, sleep problems) factors predicted class membership, controlling for demographic factors. Note that as a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the LGMM analyses using just participants from the US.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We identified distinct anxiety trajectories across the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The patterns that emerged were consistent with theoretical expectations, revealing four distinct patterns of response. The most prevalent response in our study cohort was a resilient trajectory of low stable anxiety, suggesting that most individuals evidenced modest distress reactions, even in the face of the highly disruptive events of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, other distinct responses patterns also emerged, including a pattern of recovery from initially high levels of anxiety, delayed or worsening anxiety, and chronically elevated anxiety. Importantly, although the course of the pandemic changed markedly over time, as cases, deaths, lockdowns, and mask-wearing mandates varied over the study period, the vast majority of participants exhibited little change in anxiety levels, with more than 86&#x0025; of the sample remaining stable in their anxiety levels (i.e., in the resilient or chronic trajectories). Our findings suggest the robust capacity for a large majority of individuals to remain resilient (i.e., not develop significant anxiety symptoms), even in response to an acute and uncertain stressor. However, a subset of individuals appeared vulnerable to persistent and worsening anxiety over time. We also identified several key demographic and risk and resilience factors that differentiated group membership, highlighting potential avenues for future personalized interventions.</p>
<p>From a population perspective over time, one can view the emergence of the COVID-19 outbreak as having potentially profound negative effects on mental health. However, prior research on acute and chronic stress exposures suggest that effects will show considerable variation across individuals, time, and contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mancini, 2020</xref>). One way to assess this variation is to examine anxiety as an index of stress-reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adhikari et al., 2015</xref>) and resilience as a stable outcome and positive adaptation to adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bonanno, 2004</xref>). We used latent group-based trajectory modeling to identify subpopulations of individuals who show different patterns over time on a repeated measures outcome and the characteristics associated with resilient outcomes (Muthen, 2004). We found that a considerable majority of participants (75&#x0025;) were resilient, with stable low levels of anxiety over time. Our findings are consistent with prior studies that have documented resilience as the most common pattern in response to a wide variety of stressors, including school shootings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mancini, Littleton, &#x0026; Grills, 2016</xref>), combat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Maguen et al., 2020</xref>), traumatic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">deRoon-Cassini, Mancini, Rusch, &#x0026; Bonanno, 2010</xref>) and bereavement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mancini et al., 2011</xref>). The findings are also consistent with a longitudinal cohort study of 1296 participants in Australia in which similar anxiety trajectory patterns emerged, including a resilient pattern characterizing 77&#x0025; of the sample. In addition, a recent review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies on the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns suggested that even in the face of recent lockdowns, a major stress that implicated people&#x2019;s life, most individuals retain their capacity for psychological adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prati &#x0026; Mancini, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, we were able to document differences between participants in the different trajectory classes on the basis of demographic factors, worries about and stressors associated with COVID-19, and baseline risk and resilience characteristics. In line with studies from current pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Filgueiras &#x0026; Stults-Kolehmainen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sherman, Williams, Amick, Hudson, &#x0026; Messias, 2020</xref>) and as documented in previous research on resiliency, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bonanno, Romero, &#x0026; Klein, 2015</xref>), a number of contextual variables were significantly associated with better outcomes; including older age, male gender, and greater level of education. Indeed, men generally report lower levels of psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">L&#x00F6;we et al., 2008</xref>), yet another possible explanation could be the increased burden around childcare during school closures, which was especially high among working mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Power, 2020</xref>). Findings regarding older adults may reflect their tendency to develop strengths through a lifetime of experiences, or their ability to negotiate through challenges better than younger adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Charles, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of stressors to and worries about the pandemic, we found no differences between groups on the basis of COVID-19 baseline stressors. That is, groups did not differ in their exposure to the virus or the participant&#x2019;s occupational consequences. In terms of worries, we found that participants in the chronic anxiety trajectory reported significantly more worries related to COVID-19, notably in relation to financial burdens, as well as concerns for self and others contracting the virus, and suffered from poorer sleep quality, replicating prior findings in study of German participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gilan et al. 2020</xref>). Sleep represents a neurobiological balance between arousal and de-arousal and considered as a basic dimension for brain function and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Harvey, Murray, Chandler, &#x0026; Soehner, 2011</xref>). Sleep quality was previously found to mediate the association between COVID-related stressors and mental health outcomes in a large community samples of adults from the United States and Israel during the early stages of the pandemic, highlighting the central role that sleep plays in promoting resilience in the face of stress during COVID 19 pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Coiro et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we found that more than 50&#x0025; of participants in the chronic anxiety group had reported a past diagnosis of anxiety. This finding is consistent with prior studies suggesting that the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic appear more pronounced among vulnerable populations (Pan et al., 2021). Thus, it is essential to implement programs that can overcome systemic barriers of care and decrease global health disparities in vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>In terms of resilience, we found that emotion regulation was significantly higher among participants in the resilient trajectory compared to all other trajectories. Notably, emotion regulation scores significantly differed between participants in the resilient trajectory and those in the delayed anxiety trajectory, suggesting that this capacity may be important to sustain low anxiety levels throughout longitudinal exposure to the pandemic related stress (i.e., 6-months of study period). Broadly defined, emotion regulation includes the ability to identify and accept emotional experiences, control impulsive behaviors when distressed, and flexibly modulate emotional responses as situationally appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Renna, Quintero, Fresco, &#x0026; Mennin, 2017</xref>). Low levels of emotion regulation have previously been linked to risk for anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen and Bonanno 2021</xref>), as well as externalizing problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cappadocia, Desrocher, Pepler, &#x0026; Schroeder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mitchell, Robertson, Anastopolous, Nelson-Gray, &#x0026; Kollins, 2012</xref>). Hence, it is not merely a signal for anxiety, but represent instead, a trans-diagnostic marker for psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aldao, Nolen-Hoeksema, &#x0026; Schweizer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beauchaine &#x0026; Thayer, 2015</xref>). High emotion regulation capacity, biologically reflected by prefrontal inhibition, is considered as a key mechanism in psychological health, hence crucial for adaptive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aldao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gross, 2007</xref>). Our findings support pre-pandemic data suggesting that emotion regulation serves as mediator of the relationship between resilience and distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Vaughan et al., 2019</xref>), and expand latest findings suggesting that individual differences in emotion regulation prospectively predict early COVID-19 related acute stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tyra, Griffin, Fergus, &#x0026; Ginty, 2021</xref>). Specifically, we suggest that interventions aimed at emotion regulation might be especially warranted as a modality to enhance resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Renna, Fresco, &#x0026; Mennin, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>A second resilience factor that differentiated between the chronic and resilient groups was hostility in close relationships, with significant low hostility features reported by the resilient trajectory participants. This findings might be indicative of the different interpersonal challenges facing individuals during the pandemic, with people spending many weeks under lockdown with close others, for better or worse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gadermann et al., 2021</xref>). That is, close relationships coping competences can be a way to enhance ability to deal with the stress, concerns and adverse events related to the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Prime, Wade, &#x0026; Browne, 2020</xref>). In particular, dyadic coping had been found to play a critical role in stress reduction and in restoring psychological well-being during the COVID-19 emergency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Donato et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, we found that a more positive neighborhood environment, a resilience factor reflecting feelings of personal safety and community cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mujahid, Diez Roux, Morenoff, &#x0026; Raghunathan, 2007</xref>), was significantly higher among recovered participants compared to participants in the delayed and chronic anxiety trajectories, highlighting the importance of social cohesion and community support in the face of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fone et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed resilience may be supported by the enhanced availability of social support after shared stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mancini, Westphal, &#x0026; Griffin, 2021</xref>). Relevant to both individual and community aspects of resiliency, recent research suggests that community resilience, in addition to individual levels resilience, informs resilient outcomes and capacity to cope with threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kimhi, Marciano, Eshel, &#x0026; Adini, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ungar &#x0026; Theron, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>A strength of the current study is the leveraging of a large sample with prospective longitudinal data collected over three time points at a critical period of the pandemic. However, our findings should be considered alongside several important study limitations. First, we used an on-line &#x201C;snow-ball&#x201D; recruitment method, which reduced the representativeness of our sample and the generalizability of the findings. Specifically, people who complete online surveys differ from people who do not, and thus the proportions of people in each trajectory should not be taken as population-level estimates (Pierce, <xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">McManus, et al., 2020</xref>). Second, our cohort included participants from the US and Israel, countries characterized by considerable differences in virus spread, government restrictions, and health care. Indeed, living in Israel predicted membership in the resilient group. Notably, however, at time T1 data collection, the restrictions on residents were similar in both Israel and the US. Moreover, a recent study in the US, the United Kingdom, and Israel similarly found that Israeli participants exhibited lower levels of general anxiety compared to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bareket-Bojmel, Shahar, &#x0026; Margalit, 2020</xref>), which might reflect cultural differences in expressing anxiety symptoms. Importantly, the trajectory patterns were largely robust to these differences, and similar findings emerged when the sample was restricted to only the US participants.</p>
<p>In sum, we found distinct patterns of adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic in our longitudinal cohort. These patterns were prospectively predicted by dispositional resilience factors and by COVID-19 stressors, suggesting that self-reported capacities for resilience and resources for resilience predict longitudinal outcomes. Together, these findings suggest most people show a robust capacity for resilience to the pandemic, but they also suggest that COVID-19 stressors contributed to worse adjustment among a subset of vulnerable individuals. Intriguingly, given that dispositional resilience factors prospectively predicted resilient outcomes, our findings highlight future targets for intervention that can help to reduce the mental health burden following major global stressors.</p>
