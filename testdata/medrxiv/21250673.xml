<abstract><p>The authors have withdrawn this manuscript because, following comments received during the review process, they have updated the number of countries included in their study (and also changed from 5 to 10 years the limit for Vit-D information studies that they included), which led to non-significant correlations between mortality and infections and Vit D deficiency prevalence. Therefore, the authors do not wish this work to be cited as reference for the project. If you have any questions, please contact the corresponding author.</p></abstract>
