<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Definition of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses is essential to verify protective immunity following infection and vaccination. Here, we devised a versatile serological test, named ABCORA, that is based on a multifactorial analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and circulating human coronavirus (HCoV) antibody responses. Utilizing empirical tailored cut-offs and computational approaches based on training and validation cohorts comprising pre-pandemic (N&#x003D;825) and SARS-CoV-2 infected plasma donors (N&#x003D;389), we defined several analysis strategies that allow a highly accurate definition of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and prediction of neutralization activity. Intriguingly, HCoV reactivity was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 negative donors. Amongst SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, elevated SARS-CoV-2 responses were linked to higher HCoV activity suggesting that pre-existing HCoV immunity may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and promote development of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses. Deciphering interdependencies between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV immunity should be enforced as understanding their impact on infection may allow soliciting cross-protective activities for broader coronavirus prevention.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Monitoring the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to define correlates of vaccine protection, differences in susceptibility to infection and in disease severity. The picture of the antibody landscape to SARS-CoV-2 that has thus far evolved is complex. The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is rapid, and triggers strong IgM, IgA and IgG responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Both binding and neutralizing responses increase with disease severity and show in part dependence on demographic parameters such as age and gender <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. It remains, however, unclear which factors are independent drivers of antibody responses, reflect severe disease courses or are confounded by other factors including infection length and co-morbidities. Waning IgG binding and neutralizing antibody titers have been described in some but not all convalescent cohorts and may be particularly pronounced in individuals with asymptomatic or mild infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. IgG responses to spike (S) glycoprotein may persist longer than to nucleocapsid protein (N)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> and can in part undergo affinity maturation post virus clearance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Current serological analyses predominantly focus on measuring reactivity to N, the spike glycoprotein S1 subunit and the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Antibodies to RBD and the receptor-binding motif within the RBD constitute the main group of neutralizing antibodies, followed by S1 trimer specific, spike N-terminal domain, and spike S2 neutralizing antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. S1 and RBD binding correlate with neutralizing activity in both natural and vaccine-induced immune responses providing means to estimate the potential for neutralization where neutralization capacity cannot be assessed directly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Considering the complex antibody response patterns, possibilities to capture the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 response across diverse Immunoglobulin (Ig) classes and SARS-CoV-2 antigens are needed to ascertain sensitive detection of seroconversion and sero-reversion and to establish links to protective, neutralizing activity.</p>
<p>Infections with circulating human coronaviruses (HCoV), alphacoronavirus (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63) and betacoronavirus (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43), are common and contribute considerably to the seasonal respiratory disease burden in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Despite an overall modest sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 and circulating HCoVs, several conserved regions exist and antibody cross-reactivity may occur <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. While dismissed in the diagnostic setting as false-positives <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, cross-reactive antibodies may bear biological relevance as suggested for S2 cross-neutralizing antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Uncertainty remains, however, whether cross-reactive HCoV antibody responses influence the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity. Positive impact by providing early low affinity memory responses to build on and mature as well as negative influences following the antigenic sin principle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> by boosting non-protective cross-reactive antibodies on the expense of de-novo responses can be envisaged. In view of this, the definition of pre-existing immunity due to prior infection with HCoVs will remain complex in clinical diagnosis and strategies to record HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 responses side by side are needed to fill this knowledge gap.</p>
<p>Here we report on the development of a serological assay that allows multifactorial seroprofiling of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV responses at high diagnostic accuracy. Seroprofiling of a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected individuals provided key insights into the interdependencies of HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. The results highlight a potential protective role of HCoV-specific antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 acquisition as well as in shaping the SARS-CoV-2 response upon infection.</p>

<title>Multifactorial seroprofiling defines SARS-CoV-2 specific responses</title>
<p>Recognizing the need for comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 serological profiling to elucidate central questions in SARS-CoV-2 immunity and its interdependencies with HCoV responses, we created a bead-based multiplex immunoassay using the Luminex technology&#x00A9; to measure specific IgG, IgA and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1, S2 and N (Supplementary Fig. 1). The assay records in total 12 SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody parameters (4 antigens across 3 Ig classes) with high diagnostic accuracy (see methods, Supplementary Fig. 1-4 and Supplementary Tables 1, 2) and further includes the S1 protein of HCoV-HKU1 to screen cross-reactive antibodies alongside SARS-CoV-2 responses. According to the test&#x2019;s design to monitor antibodies to two coronaviruses, we termed the assay <bold>A</bold>nti<bold>b</bold>ody <bold>COR</bold>onavirus <bold>A</bold>ssay (ABCORA) 2.0.</p>
<p>Measurements in ABCORA are expressed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) corrected for background binding (fold over empty beads, FOE). To distinguish SARS-CoV-2-specific from cross-reactive antibodies, we defined MFI-FOE thresholds for each of the 12 SARS-CoV-2 antigen and Ig class combinations based on plasma antibody reactivity in training cohorts of pre-pandemic healthy donor plasma (Training I, N&#x003D;573) and in donors with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (Training III, N&#x003D;175) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). Thresholds were set to minimize false-positives while ensuring sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, c</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). Signal over cut-off (SOC) values were calculated for each of the 12 SARS-CoV-2 antibody parameters based on the established threshold values. Positive call criteria were defined to ascertain that in at least two of the 12 antigen and Ig combinations the threshold is reached (Supplementary Table 4). The final threshold and positive call criteria allowed for a differentiation of partial (only IgM and IgA responses) to full seroconversion (including IgG responses). In addition, the criteria denote samples with weak reactivity and/or indeterminate reactivity (Supplementary Table 5).</p>

</fig>
<p>We further evaluated the ABCORA 2.0 test in clinical samples of pre-pandemic patients with documented, recent HCoV infection (Training II, N&#x003D; 75, OC43 (N&#x003D;27), HKU1 (N&#x003D;17), NL63 (N&#x003D;22), 229E (N&#x003D;9)). This group comprised individuals with different underlying severe diseases including immune compromised patients that underwent diagnostic screening for HCoV. We noted an overall lower reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 in this syndromic group but importantly observed no indication of cross-reactivity that affects the ABCORA readout. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Considering data of all training cohorts (I-III), ABCORA 2.0 exhibited a high sensitivity and specificity, reaching 94.29% sensitivity and 99.07% specificity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, Supplementary Table 3).</p>
<p>To obtain insight into potential cross-reactivity with HCoV antibodies, we recorded reactivity to the S1 unit of HCoV-HKU1 in addition to the SARS-COV-2 antigens (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Owing to the high prevalence of HCoV antibodies and the ensuing lack of true-negative controls, we set no thresholds to rate HKU1 reactivity as positive/negative. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactivity was low in pre-pandemic samples despite notable HKU1 activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Correlation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and HKU1 plasma antibody reactivity in SARS-CoV-2 positive donors indicated no correlation in IgG but a substantial cross-reactivity between HKU1 S1 IgM and to lesser extent also IgA (Supplementary Fig. 5a). In pre-pandemic individuals, IgM binding to SARS-CoV-2 and HKU1 was highly correlated whereas IgG and IgA reactivities were less affected (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Of note, individuals with recent HCoV infection showed the highest correlation in IgM between HKU1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 5d). These data underline that cross-reactivity needs to be considered but mostly affects low level responses as evidenced by the measurements in pre-pandemic individuals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 5).</p>
<p>We verified the performance of ABCORA 2.0 on separate validation cohorts of pre-pandemic healthy adults (N&#x003D;252), pre-pandemic children (N&#x003D;169) and individuals with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (N&#x003D; 214) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a, b</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). The outcome of this assessment confirmed the validity of the chosen assay criteria. Sensitivity and specificity of the combined negative cohorts were even slightly higher than in the training cohort (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Of note, when analyzing children and adults in the validation cohort separately, we observed a slightly lower specificity amongst children (98.82%) compared to adults (99.60%), raising the possibility that cross-reactive activity in children may be more prevalent than in adults (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Indeed, pre-pandemic children showed a higher correlation of IgM HKU1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 5c), highlighting that interpretation of IgM SARS-CoV-2 activity can be complex. Importantly, combining training and validation cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (N&#x003D;389) and negative controls (N&#x003D; 825), ABCORA 2.0 achieved a sensitivity of 94.60% and a specificity of 99.16%, underlining the high capacity of the test in accurately assessing SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

<title>Computational analyses maximize specificity and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 seroprofiling</title>
<p>We next sought to devise computational analysis extensions to further increase specificity. We compared two analysis approaches, the first was based on a logistic regression model (ABCORA 2.1), the second on a random forest model (ABCORA 2.2). Instead of obtaining 12 individual thresholds (one per antigen and Ig class) as in ABCORA 2.0, both computational models solely estimate the probability of a sample to be positive by providing a composite result across all 12 measurements and ranking sera positive or negative (1, 0 classification). Both analysis strategies were established on the training dataset used for the setup of ABCORA 2.0 (Training I&#x2013;III, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). For the logistic regression ABCORA 2.1, we grouped SARS-CoV-2 binding activities displaying high correlation (Supplementary Fig. 6a) and included the mean value of their MFI-FOEs in the model. The analysis on the validation data sets recorded 93.46% sensitivity and 99.60% specificity in adults and 99.41% specificity in children. When assessed with the combined training and validation cohort data sets, 93.57% sensitivity and 99.35% specificity were detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, Supplementary Table 3).</p>
<p>The random forest model ABCORA 2.2 included all 12 SARS-CoV-2 responses measured and aggregated the result of 1000 classification trees. ABCORA 2.2 succeeded in tailoring thresholds tightly to the training data sets, obtaining classification settings with 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity. This high specificity was confirmed by analysis of the validation data sets (IV and V) comprising pre-pandemic samples from healthy adults (specificity 100%) and children (specificity 99.41%). ABCORA 2.2 reached a sensitivity of 95.33% in the validation set, outperforming both ABCORA 2.0 and 2.1. Of note, positive calling by ABCORA 2.2 was dominated by IgG responses (Supplementary Fig. 6b). On the combined training and validation cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (N&#x003D;389) and negative controls (N&#x003D; 825), ABCORA 2.2 achieved a striking sensitivity of 97.43% and a specificity of 99.91%. Prompted by the observed correlation between SARS-CoV-2 and HKU1 IgM and to a lesser extent IgA responses, we next explored whether incorporation of HKU1 reactivity into the random forest model may further improve the calling specificity and sensitivity. Indeed, a model that included HKU1 S1 as additional variable (ABCORA 2.3) increased sensitivity from 97.43% in ABCORA 2.2 to 98.20% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, Supplementary Table 3) without reduction of the specificity. Owing to its combined high sensitivity and specificity, we therefore selected ABCORA 2.3 as the analysis strategy for rating global SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion.</p>
<p>We next verified the accuracy of ABCORA 2.0 and 2.3 in defining positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 immune status utilizing the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) Anti SARS-CoV-2 Verification Panel (20/B770)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. This verification panel for serology assays includes 23 positive and 14 negative serum samples and allows direct comparison with other test systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Both ABCORA versions showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity on the verification plasma panel and compared favorably to commercial assay systems (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, Supplementary Table 6). To cross-reference these external verification results, we next compared the sensitivity of the ABCORA tests and three commercial serology test systems on a subset of the SARS-CoV-2 positive training cohort (cohort III, N&#x003D;171) for which sufficient material remained. Assays targeting the N protein (Elecsys&#x00AE; Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH)), the RBD region of the S protein (Elecsys&#x00AE; Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH)), and the S1 subunit (EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG)) were included. The results confirmed the analysis on the international NIBSC 20/B770 plasma panel, with ABCORA 2.0 and ABCORA 2.3 showing the highest sensitivity amongst the tested assays (Supplementary Table 7).</p>
<p>We thus conclude that ABCORA 2.0 seroprofiling in combination with ABCORA 2.3 defines positivity with the highest specificity and sensitivity. The individual antigen response evaluation by ABCORA 2.0 defines the stage of seroconversion status based on individual IgM, IgA and IgG cut-off values and thereby complements and maximizes the information that can be obtained by ABCORA 2 seroprofiling.</p>

<title>Predicting SARS-CoV-2 neutralization based on ABCORA seroprofiling</title>
<p>Determining neutralization activity is critical to gauge protective immunity. While neutralization can be directly measured with a range of authentic virus or pseudovirus SARS-CoV-2 neutralization tests <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, applying direct binding or competition tests as surrogate for neutralization activity remains of high interest as these test systems are faster, less labor-intensive, widely applicable and scalable <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In particular, S1 and RBD binding has been shown to correlate well with neutralization activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. To explore neutralization predictors based on ABCORA 2.0, we probed in a first step the capacity of ABCORA to derive quantitative S1 and RBD readouts in a subset of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (N&#x003D;72). ABCORA 2.0 measurements of serially diluted plasma were conducted to derive 50% effective concentrations (EC50, expressed as reciprocal plasma dilution) and area under the curve values (AUC expressed as MFI) for all 12 SARS-CoV-2 parameters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). In addition, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 responses via the RBD specific mAb CR3022 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) and the WHO International Standard Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin NIBSC 20/136<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. 7b, Supplementary Table 8). For this we quantified the respective antibody content of a positive control SARS-CoV-2 donor pool included in all ABCORA measurements and expressed the antibody content of individual plasma samples in relation to it (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 7). We then probed which of the ABCORA quantitative readouts correlated best with each other, the basic readout of ABCORA 2.0 (MFI-FOE at plasma dilution 1/100), and the quantitative Roche Elecsys S test (U/ml) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 7). In addition to the individual antigen parameters, we also considered cumulative response values. These were total spike reactivity (sum of RBD, S1, S2 across all Ig classes), Ig class spike reactivity (sum of S1, RBD, S2 for one isotype) and antigen specific reactivity (sum of all Ig classes for one antigen). We observed a genuinely good correlation across the diverse spike parameters tested (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The notable exception were classical EC50 values, which showed no to weak correlation across all parameters including the commercial test. Interestingly, AUC values, which in contrast to EC50 are a composite measure of concentration and signal strength, performed well. Of note, we observed highly variable SARS-CoV-2 antibody dose response curves, reaching in our cohort individual plateaus over a 4-log range (Supplementary Fig. 7). These plateaus are respected in the AUC readout, and are also recorded by the basic MFI-FOE ABCORA readout at 1/100 plasma dilution, but are not considered in EC50 determinations. Indeed the basic MFI-FOE showed a high correlation with the quantitative readouts across the tested variables including the quantitative commercial Roche Elecsys S test.</p>

</fig>
<p>Based on these results, we concluded that the MFI-FOE readout at 1/100 provides an excellent estimate for the S1 and RBD antibody content in plasma and that this straightforward and easily obtainable readout, which only requires a single plasma dilution to be tested, can be used as a proxy for quantification. We therefore employed the basic MFI-FOE in a next step to define neutralization predictors.</p>
<p>Neutralization activity to Wuhan-Hu-1 in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (N&#x003D;467) using an established SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization test <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> revealed a broad range of 50% neutralizing titers (NT50) (post positive RT-PCR <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> (N&#x003D;369), post onset of symptoms, Supplementary Fig. 8a (N&#x003D;333)), in line with previous findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Early in infection (within 30 days of positive RT-PCR) neutralization titers were significantly higher (p&#x003C;0.001) and correlated better with binding parameters. As expected, IgG responses to spike antigens showed the highest correlation with neutralization activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 8-9). We next grouped patients based on the population into high (NT50 &#x003E;250, N&#x003D;135) and no or low neutralizers (NT50 &#x003C;250, N&#x003D;332)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) and compared the prediction ability of six different classification models to assign individuals based on their ABCORA 2.0 binding patterns to these groups. Univariable logistic regression (ULR) models included only one variable: either the mean of MFI-FOE S1 reactivities (ULR-S1), or the mean of MFI-FOE RBD reactivities (ULR-RBD). A multivariable logistic regression (MLR) included both S1 and RBD mean reactivities. The additional models included all 12 antigen reactivities measured in ABCORA and comprised a random forest approach and two MLR strategies based on principle component analysis (PCA, 2 and 4 first axis). Models were compared based on AUC and the BIC (Bayesian information criterion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>) by cross validation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c</xref>). All models performed similarly, with the univariable model based on the mean of S1 reactivities (ULR-S1) yielding the best BIC value. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis based on ULR-S1 showed a good capacity in predicting neutralization status yielding AUC 0.90 (N&#x003D; 467, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Exploring different cutoffs to balance sensitivity and specificity keeping both above 80%, we chose to assign samples to the high neutralizers group if its predicted probability was above 70%. This corresponds to an 83% specificity in correctly assigning non&#x2013;neutralizers and 80% sensitivity in assigning neutralizers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d, e</xref>). To increase the utility of the ULR-S1 prediction model for clinical diagnostics, we devised a modified neutralization prediction model ULR-S1-SOC based on the SOC values reported for ABCORA 2.0. At 70% predicted probability, ULR-S1-SOC delivers neutralization prediction at similar sensitivity (81%) and specificity (81%) by examining if the composite S1 SOC value (sum of S1 SOC values for IgG, IgA and IgM) is below or above 9.7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Thus, based on ULR-S1-SOC neutralization activity can be ranked directly from the basic SOC readout. We therefore conclude that the basic readout in ABCORA 2.0 can deliver a reliable prediction of high neutralization activity.</p>

Half-lives of the neutralization relevant IgG responses to RBD and S1 where 209 and 323 days, respectively.

Neutralization activity decreased overall at a slower rate, with a half-life of 410 days (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c</xref>). This was in part due to a mixed reactivity pattern with some individuals showing an increase in neutralization activity post positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, while neutralization activity in others rapidly decayed (Supplementary Fig. 10c).</p>

<title>Interdependencies of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV immunity</title>
<p>To enable a more detailed analysis of HCoV antibody reactivity alongside SARS-CoV-2, we expanded the bead antigen array to include S1 proteins of all four circulating HCoVs (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43) (Supplementary Fig. 11a). According to its capacity to monitor antibodies to five coronaviruses we termed the assay ABCORA 5.0 and trained and validated it on the same cohorts as ABCORA 2.0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To allow direct comparison with ABCORA 2.0 and use of the neutralization prediction models, we used the threshold-/SOC-based analysis settings of ABCORA 2.0 also for ABCORA 5.0. Based on ABCORA 5.0 measurements of training cohorts I-III, we devised two random forest-based analysis models. ABCORA 5.4 included solely the 12 SARS-CoV-2 parameters, ABCORA 5.5 included in addition the S1 HCoV measurements adding up to 24 parameters in total. In analogy to ABCORA 2.3, incorporation of HCoV reactivity into the model was advantageous. ABCORA 5.5 provided the highest sensitivity and specificity amongst the analysis algorithms probed ABCORA 5.0 (Supplementary Fig. 11b, Supplementary Table 10).</p>
<p>Interdependencies between antibody reactivity to the four HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 mirrored what we previously observed for HKU1 with a particular high correlation of IgM reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs in pre-pandemic individuals, particularly in those with recent HCoV infection (Supplementary Fig. 12). HCoV infections are frequent but subject to seasonality and prevalence of individual HCoV infections fluctuates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In line with this, the prevalence of HCoV responses measured by ABCORA 5.0 in local blood donors in January 2019 (N&#x003D;285), May 2019 (N&#x003D;288), and January 2020 (N&#x003D;252) varied considerably (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). To enable a time-controlled comparison of HCoV reactivity between SARS-CoV-2-infected and healthy donors, we screened blood donors from May 2020 (N&#x003D;672), when SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was estimated below 2% in Zurich, Switzerland <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, by ABCORA 2.0/5.0 and excluded all samples with SARS-CoV-2 reactivity. The residual May 2020 cohort (N&#x003D; 653) formed a pandemic, healthy donor control group. Interestingly, HCoV reactivity patterns in 2019 and 2020 differed substantially as assessed by one-way ANOVA, with January 2020 showing the comparatively lowest and May 2020 the highest IgA and IgG reactivity, which may indicate a later onset of an HCoV epidemic in 2020 compared to 2019 (t-tests of May 2020 versus other groups shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

Pre-pandemic samples included: January 2019 (N&#x003D;285), May 2019 (N&#x003D;288), January 2020 (N&#x003D;252).

<p>Most intriguingly, a time-matched analysis comparing May 2020 healthy donors with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients sampled in April, May and June 2020 (N&#x003D;65) revealed significantly lower HCoV reactivity in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). This pattern was also evident when we extended the analysis to include the full cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals measured with ABCORA 5.0 (N&#x003D;389, sampled from March 2020 to February 2021, Supplementary Fig. 13). Overall, this raised the possibility that pre-existing immune responses to HCoVs may to a certain degree protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We therefore investigated whether HCoV responses are linked to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with known date of first positive RT-PCR (SARS-CoV-2 patients measured in ABCORA 5.0 with time since positive RT-PCR&#x003C;60 days, N&#x003D;204). Associations were investigated with a linear regression model adjusted for age, gender, time since positive RT-PCR and HCoV reactivity. To stratify HCoV reactivity into high and low HCoV activity, median logMFI-FOE were defined for each HCoV and antibody class. LogMFI-FOE higher than the corresponding median for at least three HCoVs (HKU1, OC43, NL63 or 229E) in a specific Ig class were ranked as having high HCoV activity within this class. First, only reactivities among the same antibody class were explored in the model (i.e. HCoV IgG high on SARS-CoV-2 IgGs). We observed exceptionally strong interdependencies for IgA and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2, which all were significantly higher in individuals with high HCoV reactivity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). This strongly suggests that pre-existing HCoV immunity may provide an advantage in mounting SARS-CoV-2 responses. Interdependencies between HCoV IgG and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG were only observed for the S2 response. To explore if SARS-CoV-2 IgG may build on recent HCoV IgA and IgM responses we next probed whether HCoV IgM and IgA are linked to elevated SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG levels. While no effect was evident for IgM, we observed a significant association of high HCoV IgA activity on all four measured SARS-CoV-2 responses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c, d</xref>). This strongly suggests that recent HCoV infection has a beneficial effect on mounting SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses.</p>

Grey boxes indicate values above the individual MFI-FOE cut-offs for SARS-CoV-2 specific responses for each antigen. Stars correspond to levels of significance of t-tests comparing negative versus positive patients. Levels of significance are corrected by the Bonferroni method for multiple testing and indicated as follows: &#x002A;p&#x003C;0.05/12, &#x002A;&#x002A;p&#x003C;0.01/12, &#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;p&#x003C; 0.001/12.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Definition of SARS-CoV-2 immunity post vaccination and infection is of immediate importance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Deciphering antibody correlates of SARS-CoV-2 protection and monitoring vaccine responsiveness are challenging tasks ahead. The magnitude and longevity of protective antibody responses to natural infection and of different vaccines need to be examined to understand parameters that shape protective responses and guide decisions on re-vaccination in non-responders and immunization against novel arising SARS-CoV-2 variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Likewise, creating means to serologically distinguish between de novo infection, re-infection, and vaccine responses, their durability and failures will be critical for clinical diagnosis.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate the high utility of multi-parameter seroprofiling in addressing key issues in defining SARS-CoV-2 immunity. We designed SARS-CoV-2 seroprofiling tests, termed ABCORA, to address research and clinical diagnostics needs. Simultaneous recording of antibody responses to a range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens and different Ig classes with ABCORA seroprofiling yields an extensive picture on the SARS-CoV-2 serology status in a single assessment. High accuracy in defining SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and staging of seroconversion was achieved by a computational analysis. Validation and verification of the performance of ABCORA against internal and external standards proved its exceptional performance enabling application in clinical diagnostics and research.</p>
<p>Measuring neutralization will remain the ultimate goal to determine protective immunity to infection and immunization. Protective activity against novel arising SARS-CoV-2 variants needs to be determined <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Collecting information on neutralizing activity in large population groups is however challenging as cell-based neutralization assays are not in wide diagnostic use and have limited turnover and scalability. Means to derive estimates of neutralization activity based on comparatively simpler binding assays would therefore provide an enormous advantage as previously suggested <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. As we demonstrate, computational modeling allows predicting plasma neutralization capacity from ABCORA seroprofiling results, obliterating the need to conduct labor-intensive and costly neutralization tests in clinical diagnostics or in large-scale research-based screens. The same principle can be applied in future assay extensions to predict neutralization activity against novel SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>
<p>The successful development of a sensitive seroprofiling test enabled a precise analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics and their interplay with HCoV responses. We utilized two ABCORA assay versions that both measured HCoV reactivity alongside the 12 SARS-CoV-2 parameters. ABCORA 2 included the S1 antigen of HKU1. ABCORA 5 included S1 of all four circulating HCoVs. Notably, computational models that included the HCoV measurements allowed a higher precision in determining SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, highlighting interdependencies between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 responses that need to be resolved. Recording reactivity against all four HCoVs in SARS-CoV-2 uninfected and infected individuals we observed intriguing associations. Uninfected individuals displayed higher HCoV reactivity compared to infected individuals. However, amongst persons with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, those with high HCoV reactivity developed higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. While association studies as ours cannot formally define causality, the implications of our findings are evident: Prior immunity to HCoV may protect to some extent against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and may provide a boost to the development of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity. While we solely measured antibody responses, a potential protective effect of HCoV immunity against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition should not be viewed restricted to antibody activity. Antibodies and cellular immunity may both be relevant and act in concert <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Alternatively, antibody responses measured in the present study may solely document recent HCoV infection and deliver a surrogate measurement of other protective HCoV responses. The link between higher HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 reactivity in infected individuals is particularly intriguing. Strongest effects were seen for IgM and IgA HCoV responses, suggesting that recent HCoV immunity provides an early boost to SARS-CoV-2 antibody development. Whether this is due to cross-reactive B cell responses on which the SARS-CoV-2 immunity builds on and matures or whether cross-reactive T helper activities play a role will be important to resolve in forth-coming studies. Likewise the precise role and timing of the HCoV responses that shape SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses needs to be defined. Early, low affinity HCoV responses may have a positive impact for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 immunity by providing an immune memory to build on, while the boosting of non-protective cross-reactive HCoV antibodies may have a negative impact following the antigenic sin principle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our findings have multiple implications and warrant further investigation of the interplay between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 immunity. A modest protective effect by HCoV immunity would be a plausible explanation for the high proportion of asymptomatic and mild SARS-CoV-2 infections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Even more intriguing are future perspectives. As others and we have shown, SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV immunity to infection is often not long-lasting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 10) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, a limitation that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines hope to overcome. Should SARS-CoV-2 responses in turn provide a degree of defense against HCoV infection, broad protection against coronaviruses may be in reach.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Human specimen</title>
<p>Serum and plasma samples collected pre and post emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland (pre and post February 2020, respectively) were included. No patient enrollment was conducted for the present study. All experiments involving samples from human donors were conducted with the approval of the responsible local ethics committee Zurich, Switzerland (BASEC Nrs 2020-01327, 2020-00363; Req-2021-00437; 2020-00787), in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation. Samples were obtained from the following sources: i) Zurich blood donation services (ZHBDS): Anonymized healthy adult plasma from pre-pandemic time points (January 2019, May 2019 and January 2020) and from the first wave of the pandemic in Zurich, Switzerland (May 2020) were provided by the ZHBDS internal serum repository (BASEC 2020-00363). ii) Anonymized leftover specimens from routine diagnostics at the Institute of Medical Virology, University of Zurich, the University Children Hospital Zurich and the Cantonal Hospital Winterthur (BASEC Nrs 2020-01327, Req-2021-00437). iii) Healthcare workers with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection participating in a study at the University Hospital Zurich (BASEC 2020-00363). iv) Male plasma donors participating in a SARS-CoV-2 plasma therapy study conducted at the University Hospital Zurich (CPT-ZHP, Swissmedic 2020TpP1004; BASEC 2020-00787). Pre-pandemic (SARS-CoV-2 negative, N&#x003D;825) and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (N&#x003D;389) were divided into training and validation cohorts (Supplementary Table 3). The SARS-CoV-2 training cohort (N&#x003D;175) included plasma collected during infection (N&#x003D;114) and convalescence (N&#x003D;61). Per donor only one sampling time point was included, longitudinal samples of donors included in the training cohort were not included in the validation cohort to ascertain independence when assessing the sensitivity and specificity of the different diagnostic methods. The SARS-CoV-2 validation cohort (N&#x003D;214), comprised plasma collected during infection (N&#x003D;90, one sampling time point per donor) and convalescence (N&#x003D;124, 79 convalescent patients with 1-4 longitudinal samples). Multiple time points of convalescent patients were included in the validation data set to capture a wide spectrum of waning antibody titers. Cross-sectional analysis was based on samples with known time since positive RT-PCR (N&#x003D;369) or known time since symptom onset (N&#x003D;333), both including the longitudinal analysis observations. Both, time since positive RT-PCR and time since onset were known for 330 samples, with a median time of 3 days between symptom onset and RT-PCR (1<sup>st</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup> quartile: 1-7 days). Longitudinal analysis of antibody reactivity was based on 251 observations from 120 convalescent patient with known time since positive RT-PCR and time since symptom onset. Neutralization was measured on 467 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive samples (N&#x003D;369 with known time since positive RT-PCR, N&#x003D;333 with known time since symptom onset).</p>
<p>We further evaluated cross-reactivity ABCORA 2.0 and 5.0 in left-over plasma from routine diagnostics in a pre-pandemic control group with documented, recent HCoV infection (Training II, N&#x003D; 75, OC43 (N&#x003D;27), HKU1 (N&#x003D;17), NL63 (N&#x003D;22), 229E (N&#x003D;9)). Circulating HCoV are commonly only screened for in in hospitalized, severe respiratory infections and immune compromised individuals who routinely undergo a broad screening for respiratory infections. Hence, in this patient group both, reduced antibody reactivity due to immune compromising or elevated HCoV antibody reactivity due to recent or recurring HCoV infection may occur. As this group is diagnostically relevant we considered it prudent to include this cohort as Training II data set to verify if cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 in ABCORA occurs in this setting. Training II data were not included in the threshold definition to not over-represent individuals with severe illness. This HCoV infected group displayed overall lower reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 than plasma from healthy adults but importantly showed no indication of cross-reactivity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). Pandemic samples from anonymous blood donors with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status collected in May 2020 (N&#x003D;672) were not included in training and validation cohorts.</p>

<title>Reagents and cell lines</title>
<p>His-tagged SARS-CoV-2-derived antigens (receptor binding domain (RBD), subunit S1 (S1), subunit S2 (S2), nucleocapsid protein (N)) and S1 of the four circulating HCoVs (HKU1, OC43, NL63, 229E) were purchased from Sino Biological Europe GmbH, Eschborn, Germany (Supplementary Table 12). Sources, specifics and concentration of detection and control antibodies and sera used for ABCORA and neutralization tests are listed in Supplementary Table 13. 293-T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-11268) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. HT1080/ACE2cl.14 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> were kindly provided by P. Bieniasz, Rockefeller University, NY. Both cell lines were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Design of multiplex bead assay ABCORA 2.0</title>
<p>We established two bead-based multiplexed SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays (ABCORA 2.0 and ABCORA 5.0) that included a range of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV antigens (Sino Biological Europe GmbH, Eschborn, Germany, Supplementary Table 12). Four SARS-CoV-2 antigens - RBD, S1, S2 and N - were included in both ABCORA 2.0 and ABCORA 5.0. ABCORA 2.0 included in addition S1 of HCoV-HKU1, ABCORA 5.0 included S1 of all circulating HCoVs (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43). In brief, individual MagPlex beads (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) with unique fluorescent bead regions were chosen for each antigen, beads were coupled and mixtures of antigen-coupled beads incubated with patient plasma in a 96-well plate set-up. Median Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) of bead-bound plasma antibodies were measured utilizing a FlexMap 3D reader (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX). We designed the assay to fulfil the following criteria: i) high specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility, ii) flexible multiplex design that allows straightforward addition and/or alteration of antigens; iii) wide dynamic range; iv) optional quantification of antibody responses; v) optional recording of antibody responses to HCoVs and vi) use in routine diagnostics and research.</p>
<p>We chose a sterically orientation capture via anti-His antibodies to ensure a homogenous antigen display. Therefore, carboxylated MagPlex beads (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) were coupled with anti-His antibody (Sino Biological Europe GmbH, Eschborn, Germany, Supplementary Table 10) and then coupled with His-tagged antigens using Bio-Plex Amine coupling (Bio-Rad Laboratories AG, Cressier, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions and as described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Serum/plasma titration is in general considered the most accurate strategy to retrieve quantitative information on antibody reactivity. However, in diagnostic use tests ideally should deliver (semi)-quantitative information from a single serum dilution to permit a sufficient throughput. The finalized assay conditions covered a 2-log MFI range across all probed antigen-Ig combinations (Supplementary Fig. 2). Ratifying the validity of using a single plasma dilution, we confirmed that plasma from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 negative plasma samples show optimal dose response curves over a wide plasma dilution range (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Importantly, a 1/100 dilution of plasma was in all cases close to the maximum signal, underlining that increasing plasma concentration would not increase signal intensity but rather endanger decreasing signals due to prozone effects (Supplementary Fig. 2d).</p>
<p>Maximal anti-His antibody loading was achieved at 5 &#x00B5;g antibody per million beads (Supplementary Fig. 2) and used as standard coupling condition. In the final protocol, five million anti-His antibody coupled magnetic beads were incubated with His-tagged antigens diluted in PBS at a concentration of 320 nM. Phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled secondary antibodies specific to IgG, IgA or IgM were used as detector antibodies (Supplementary Table 13). Quality control of the antigen loading was performed by incubating the beads with monoclonal antibodies targeting the corresponding CoV-derived antigen as detailed in Supplementary Table 12. Analysis was performed with the FlexMap 3D reader (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) with the acquisition of at least of 50 beads per bead region. Results are recorded as MFI per bead region.</p>
<p>Several control measures were installed to ascertain inter- and intra-assay performance. To ascertain a low assay-to-assay variability, large batches of individual antigen-loaded beads were prepared and frozen in aliquots until use at &#x2212;20&#x00B0;C to circumvent decay of the antigen-coupled beads (Supplementary Fig. 1). Individual coupled beads were mixed on the test day to yield the required antigen bead cocktail. Cocktails contained 60 beads per bead region per &#x00B5;l. In addition to the SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV bead regions, each cocktail included an empty bead region (no antigen coupled) to control for unspecific binding. Quality control and validation procedures for the FlexMap 3D instrument were done on each day of experiment according to manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The variability of the assay was analyzed as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. In brief, plasma samples from 20 RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were pooled and tested over a range of seven dilutions in 31 different titrations performed on 10 different days (Supplementary Fig. 3). Across all antigens and Ig classes, signals were retained over the test period of 25 days post bead coupling. Coefficients of variation (CV) of the binding signal across titrations of the 12 antigen-Ig class combinations proved low (range: 0.010-0.128, median 0.059, Supplementary Fig. 4c, d, Supplementary Tables 1, 2). Same-day and day-to day variability proved low and comparable (Supplementary Fig. 4e, f). Below a 1/100 plasma concentration, CV increased markedly (Supplementary Fig. 4d), defining 1/100 as highest concentration (lowest plasma dilution) to be tested in the assay. A 1/100 plasma dilution was thus defined as the basic dilution for screening plasma in ABCORA 2.0 when a qualitative (i.e. presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies) or semi-quantitative (i.e. MFI signal intensity) readout is required.</p>
<p>All ABCORA measurements were derived from single measurements unless stated otherwise. To measure SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in patient plasma, heat inactivated plasma (1 h at 56&#x00B0;C) was diluted 1/100 in PBS-BSA 1% unless otherwise stated. 50 &#x00B5;l diluted plasma were incubated with 50 &#x00B5;l of the ABCORA antigen bead cocktail for 30 minutes at room temperature in 96-well plates, washed three times with PBS-BSA 1% and incubated in separate reactions with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled detector antibodies for IgG, IgA or IgM at a final concentration of 1/500 in PBS-BSA 1%. This dilution was previously defined by titration of the detector antibodies to yield optimal MFI signals. After 45 minutes of incubation at room temperature, beads were washed three times with PBS-BSA 1% and analyzed in 96-well plates on the FlexMap 3D reader (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX). A minimum of 50 bead reads per antigen was acquired.</p>
<p>To control for genuine cross-reactive antibodies, each plasma sample was assessed with beads without antigen (empty bead control) in combination which each detector antibody. For analysis, raw MFI values were transformed to MFI-FOE to correct for background binding. We established mean empty bead MFI-FOE for IgG, IgA and IgM of pre-pandemic healthy donors (N&#x003D;1016) and set the mean MFI-FOE &#x002B; 4x standard deviation as threshold for the empty bead control. In absolute levels, these thresholds amounted to MFI-FOE 41.58 (IgG), 55.91 (IgA) and 269.47 (IgM). Measurements for which the empty bead control recorded values above this threshold were considered invalid and repeated. Each Luminex analysis 96-well plate was set up to contain the same set of control samples (Supplementary Fig. 1c), namely 7 serial 4-fold dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 positive control donor pool (N&#x003D;20 donors, starting dilution 1/100, Supplementary Fig. 2d) and a pre-pandemic healthy donor pool (dilution 1/100, N&#x003D;20 donors, Supplementary Fig. 2d). These positive and negative controls allow to control assay performance across independent measurements and in addition enable retrospective standardization against external controls if needed.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Definition of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in ABCORA 2.0 and ABCORA 5.0</title>
<p>Individual MFI-FOE cut-off values for SARS-CoV-2 specific responses for each of the 12 antigen/immunoglobulin combinations were set for ABCORA 2.0 based on the training cohorts (Supplementary Table 4). Threshold levels were set to reach an overall specificity above 99% and included levels for border-line reactivity for IgG RBD, IgG S1 and IgG N to allow also modest antibody reactivity to these antigens to be examined. MFI-FOE reads of individual samples were transformed into signal-over cut-off (SOC) values (MFI-FOE/threshold). SOC values are used for assessing positive reactivity for each individual antigen-antibody class combination, with SOC&#x003E;1 denoting positive reactivity, SOC&#x003C;1 denoting negative reactivity. When setting individual thresholds, it must be considered that for each of the 12 probed activities cross-reactivities may occur. With 12 individual SOC parameters recorded, overall specificity will decrease if any positive SOC independently suffices to rate a sample overall as SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive. To exemplify: Assuming independent responses, even a high 99% specificity for each antigen will add up to an overall low 88% specificity across the entire assay. We thus required for SARS-CoV-2 positive calling in ABCORA 2.0 a minimum of two specificities to reach activity above threshold. The combined SOC values used to define the overall serostatus of a given sample are detailed in Supplementary Table 5. For IgG RBD, S1 and N, for which we also recorded border-line SOC activity, we allowed for a combination of 1 antigen reactivity SOC&#x003E;1, the second reactivity SOC&#x003E; border line. The final threshold and positive call criteria allowed for a differentiation of partial (partial (early seroconversion with only IgM and IgA responses) to full seroconversion (including IgG responses) (Supplementary Table 5). In addition, the criteria denote samples with weak reactivity and/or indeterminate reactivity (Supplementary Table 5).</p>
<p>To ease comparison between ABCORA 2.0 and ABCORA 5.0 the same threshold cut-offs were used for ABCORA 5.0. We chose not to create specific cut-off thresholds for HCoV antibody reactivity as an accurate definition of a negative response is complex due to the wide-spread exposure to HCoVs and considerable antibody cross-reactivity between them. HCoV responses were however included in the statistical analyses as MFI-FOE values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Definition of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity using logistic regression classification</title>
<p>Classification of seropositive versus seronegative samples in ABCORA 2.1 was realized using logistic regression. The identical training and validation data used for the establishment for ABCORA 2.0 were used. As the ABCORA 2.0 binding reactivities were highly correlated, we included the following variables in the model (Supplementary Fig. 6a): the mean value of all IgG MFI-FOE responses (RBD, S1, S2, N), the mean value of the IgA MFI-FOE responses against RBD, S1 and S2, and the mean value of the IgM MFI FOE responses against RBD, S1 and S2. IgA and IgM responses to N were excluded as they were not clustering with the other responses of the same Ig class (Supplementary Fig. 6a). The logistic regression was used to estimate and predict the probability of a given sample to be positive (p) as follows:

A sample was then defined as positive if its predicted probability of being positive was above a threshold c&#x2019;. This threshold was defined as to obtain a specificity of at least 0.99 and maximal sensitivity on the training dataset (similarly to c for the random forest). In summary, in ABCORA 2.1, any new sample is defined as seropositive if its probability of being seropositive as estimated by the logistic regression is above c&#x2019;. Analyses were performed in R version 3.6.3.</p>

<title>Definition of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity using random forest classification</title>
<p>Classification of seropositive versus seronegative samples in context of ABCORA 2.0 and ABCORA 5.0 was realized using a random forest approach following the basic setup of random forests as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. The random forest itself was built of an ensemble of 1000 classification trees using MFI-FOE responses (IgA, IgG and IgM against RBD, S1, S2, N). The probability of a sample being positive as predicted by the random forest is the average of the probabilities over all 1000 trees. Finally, a sample is defined as positive if its probability of being positive is above a threshold c, which is defined as to obtain a specificity of at least 0.99 and a maximal sensitivity on the training dataset. In summary, any new sample is defined as seropositive if its probability of being seropositive as estimated by the random forest is above the threshold c. We conducted a series of random forest analyses that considered either only SARS-CoV-2 responses or SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV responses in ABCORA 2.0 and ABCORA 5.0: ABCORA 2.2 and ABCORA 2.3 were trained and used for prediction on ABCORA 2.0 data and included only SARS-CoV-2 responses or SARS-CoV-2 and HKU1 responses, respectively. ABCORA 5.4 (SARS-CoV-2 responses only) and ABCORA 5.5 (SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV responses) were trained on ABCORA 5.0 data. Details on the data inclusion for the respective models are listed in Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Table 10. Analyses were performed in R version 3.6.3 using packages random Forest and ranger <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Validation and verification using external controls</title>
<p>We used the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Verification Panel for Serology Assays (NIBSC code: 20/B770, NIBSC) to verify the performance of the ABCORA 2.0 and ABCORA 2.3 test. Serum samples of the verification panel measured by ABCORA 2.0/2.3 as described and results compared with the results of commercially available assays reported by the NIBSC (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and Supplementary Table 6). We further verified the sensitivity of the ABCORA 2 test in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in a direct comparison with commercial tests. Antibody status of plasma from SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (N&#x003D;171) were analyzed with the following test systems: Included test systems targeted the N protein (Elecsys&#x00AE; Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH)), the RBD region of the S protein (Elecsys&#x00AE; Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH)), and the S1 subunit (EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG)) (Supplementary Table 7).

<title>SARS-CoV-2 binding antibody titers</title>
<p>To define binding antibody titers, 8 serial 4-fold dilutions starting with a 1/25 dilution of plasma were prepared and measured in ABCORA 2.0. To derive quantitative information, MFI values were corrected for background activity (MFI-empty bead control) and we defined the area under the MFI curve (AUC) across the dilution series for each antigen-Ig combination. As a second quantitative readout, we calculated 50% effective titer concentrations (EC50) using a four-parameter logistic curve (y&#x003D;Bottom&#x002B;(Top-Bottom)/(1&#x002B;10&#x005E;((logEC50-X)&#x002A;HillSlope).</p>

<sec id="s4i">
<title>Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RBD activity</title>
<p>We used two approaches to standardize SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RBD activity. The first was based on the S1/RBD specific antibody CR3022 (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and Supplementary Table 13). Serial dilutions of IgG, IgA and IgM versions of CR3022 were used to create standard curves on RBD and S1 coated beads. The linear range of the standard and sample dilution curve was used for quantitation. We fitted a four-parameter logistic curve (y&#x003D;Bottom&#x002B;(Top-Bottom)/(1&#x002B;10&#x005E;((logEC50-X)&#x002A;HillSlope) (Supplementary Fig. 7b) through which MFI values of measured samples are interpolated into a corresponding concentration of antibody (&#x00B5;g/ml). We used this approach to quantify the concentration of RBD and S1 antibody reactivity in the positive donor control, and used titrations of the donor pool included on each ABCORA plate to calculate the S1 and RBD content of plasma samples in relation to it. We used the same strategy in combination with the WHO International Standard Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin (NIBSC 20/136 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>) to defer IU/ml content of the internal ABCORA positive donor pool and the individual specimen tested (Supplementary Fig. 7). The WHO International Standard consists of a pool of plasma from individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. RBD and S1 content of the ABCORA positive donor pool quantified via the polyclonal WHO standard was highly similar within each Ig class (Supplementary Fig. 7b). In contrast, RBD values estimated by the mAb CR3022 were a factor 2.4 &#x2013; 3.9 lower than the corresponding S1 values, suggesting an affinity difference of CR3022 for the two antigens (Supplementary Fig. 7b).</p>

<title>Temporal evolution of SARS-CoV-2 binding antibody response</title>
<p>Antibody binding of 140 convalescent patients was measured longitudinally in 274 measurements with ABCORA 2.0, including 251 measurements from 120 patients with known time since positive RT-PCR. We assumed the dynamics of antibodies (analyzed as logMFI-FOE) were following a linear trend with time and estimated the slope using a linear mixed model with random effect on the intercept. As time measures days post first positive RT-PCR result (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) or days post onset of symptoms (Supplementary Fig. 9b) were employed. Half-lives (t1/2, in days) of significant response with negative slopes were calculated based on the respective estimated slopes.

<title>SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-neutralization assay</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 plasma neutralization activity was defined using an HIV-based pseudovirus system as described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The env-inactivated HIV-1 reporter construct pHIV-1NL4-3 &#x0394;Env-NanoLuc (pHIV-1Nanoluc) and HT1080/ACE2cl.14 cells were kindly provided by P. Bieniasz, Rockefeller University, NY, USA. To create a SARS-CoV-2 spike expression plasmid (P_CoV2_Wuhan), a codon-optimized C terminal truncated (AA 1255-1273) spike encoding gene of strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession no. MN908947) was synthesized (GeneArt, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and cloned into pcDNA.3.1. Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing viruses were generated by co-transfecting 293-T cells with a mixture of pHIV-1Nanoluc, P_CoV2_Wuhan and PEI Max (Polysciences Europe GmbH, Hirschberg, Germany). After 48h virus supernatants were filtered (0.2 &#x00B5;m) and stored in aliquots at &#x2212; 80&#x00B0;C until use. Infectivity of virus stocks was measured by infection of HT1080/ACE2cl.14 cells. For this 384-well culture plate pre-treated with poly-L-Lysin were seeded with HT1080/ACE2cl.14 (2200 cells/well) one day before the assay. Cells were infected with titrated virus stocks and NanoLuc luciferase activity in cell lysates measured 48 h post infection using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI). For this, cells were washed once with PBS, supernatant was removed and cells were lysed with 20 &#x00B5;l/well of Luciferase Cell Lysis reagent (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) for 15 min under continuous shaking at room temperature. 20 &#x00B5;l of 1/ 50 diluted NanoGlo buffer were added and NanoLuc luciferase activity (relative light units, RLU) was measured after 5 min incubation at room temperature on a Perkin Elmer EnVision reader. Input of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses for neutralization assays was adjusted to yield virus infectivity corresponding to 5-10 x10<sup>6</sup> RLU (corresponding to 100-250-fold over background RLU values) in the absence of inhibitors. To measure plasma neutralization activity six serial 4-fold dilutions of plasma starting at a 1/25 dilution were prepared. 20 &#x00B5;l of the diluted plasma and 20 &#x00B5;l of virus were pre-incubated for 1 h at 37&#x00B0;C and then 30 &#x00B5;l of the virus/plasma mix were transferred to 384-well plates seeded with HT1080/ACE2cl.14 cells in a volume of 30 &#x00B5;l. This resulted in a final concentration of the plasma starting dilution of 1/100. Plasma neutralization titers causing 50%, 80% and 90% reduction in viral infectivity (NT50, NT80 and NT90, respectively) compared to controls without plasma were calculated by fitting a sigmoid dose&#x2013;response curve (variable slope) to the RLU data, using GraphPad Prism with constraints (bottom&#x003D;0, top&#x003D;100). If 50% inhibition was not achieved at the lowest plasma dilution of 1/100, a &#x2018;less than&#x2019; value was recorded. All measurements were conducted in duplicates.</p>

<title>Predicting neutralization based on ABCORA binding activity</title>
<p>To compare the ability of SARS-CoV-2 binding activity measured in ABCORA 2.0 to predict the neutralization status, we measured neutralization activity to Wuhan-Hu-1 in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (N&#x003D;467) and classified individuals as high neutralizers (NT50 &#x003E;250, N&#x003D;332) and low neutralizers (NT50 &#x003C;250, N&#x003D;135). Six different classification models were designed to assign individuals to the high or low neutralizers category, based on their ABCORA2.0 binding patterns we established two univariable logistic regression (ULR) models that included mean MFI-FOE spike antigen S1 reactivities and mean MFI-FOE spike antigen RBD reactivities, respectively. S1 and RBD were chosen due to their highest correlation with NT50 (r&#x003D; 0.82 and r&#x003D;0.80 for the total spike reactivities of S1 and RBD respectively, Supplementary Fig. 9). In addition to these two ULR, we established a multivariate logistic regression model including both mean S1 and RBD reactivities (MFI). We further devised three models that considered all 12 SARS-CoV-2 binding parameters recorded by ABCORA 2.0. Two multivariable logistic regression models were based on a principal component analysis on all binding activities and included the first two (respectively four) principal components, which explained 60% (respectively 75%) of the variance in the data. We also included in our model comparison a classification based on a random forest analysis that incorporated all 12 SARS-CoV-2 binding activity variables.</p>
<p>For all 6 models, performance was assessed in 100 cross-validation sets: each set was built by randomly sampling without replacement among the 467 measurements available. 80% of the data set was used to train the model (N&#x003D;374). Prediction of neutralization status was realized on the other 20% (N&#x003D;93) and compared to the true NT50 value and neutralization status, using a roc curve. The area under the curve (AUC) was computed for all 6 models in each cross-validation run. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was computed for all 5 logistic regressions in each cross-validation run.</p>
<p>To increase the utility of the ULR-S1 prediction model for clinical diagnostics we devised a modified neutralization prediction model ULR-S1-SOC based on the signal over cut-off (SOC) values reported for ABCORA 2.0. The ULR-S1-SOC estimates the probability of NT50&#x003E;250 based on the sum of S1 SOC values for IgG, IgA and IgM as follows:

<title>Association between HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 reactivities</title>
<p>To explore the association between HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 reactivities, we defined a new HCoV response variable (HCoV high/low) for each antibody class (IgG, IgA, IgM) as follows: a patient had high HCoV Ig reactivity for a given antibody class if its measurements were higher than the population median in at least three out of the four HCoV measurements (HKU1, OC43, NL63, 229E). To assess interdependencies between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 responses, we then included the HCoV response variable in a linear regression model of SARS-CoV-2 reactivities in the same antibody class. The linear regression models were estimated on a subset of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (N&#x003D;204), measured on ABCORA 5.0 less than 60 days since positive RT-PCR. The restriction to 60 days was chosen to allow modeling the effect of time with splines. This time period restriction further guaranteed a gender balance, as convalescent donors with longer follow up were all males recruited for a plasma therapy study (CPT-ZHP, Swissmedic 2020TpP1004). Regression analyses were adjusted on time (days post positive RT-PCR or onset of symptoms; as a spline with 3 degrees of freedom), age (as a spline with 3 degrees of freedom) and gender.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed in R (Version 3.6.3). Figures were made using the ggplot2 package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. When included, boxplots represent the following: median with the middle line, upper and lower quartiles with the box limits, 1.5x interquartile ranges with the whiskers and outliers with points. Significance of Spearman rank correlations were assessed through asymptotic t approximation. Differences in means between two groups with independent measures were tested using two-tailed t-tests. When applicable, multiple testing was adjusted using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A one-way ANOVA with 3 degrees of freedom was used in addition to two-tailed t-tests in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> to provide insights on overall versus group comparison. When analyzing datasets including repeated measurements of the same individuals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 8a, Supplementary Fig. 10b), we used linear mixed models with time since positive RT-PCR or time since symptom onset (continuous or binary variable) as fixed effect and individual as random effect. In the case of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 10c, the decreasing slope of neutralization titers was estimated by considering only individuals with neutralization titers above the detection levels (NT50&#x003E;100) at their first measurement. For all linear mixed models, a Wald test with two-sided hypothesis was used to determine if the estimated slope was significantly different from 0. In addition, half-lives were obtained from the decreasing slope estimated on the log of either MFI-FOEs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 10b) or NT50s (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 10c) as follows: t1/2&#x003D;log(2)/(slope&#x002A;log(10)). In <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>, linear regressions were used to estimate the association between hCoV and SARS-CoV-2 reactivities: a Student t-test with two-sided hypothesis was used to assess if this association was significantly different from 0.</p>

<p><bold>Supplementary Fig. 6. Variable importance for computational models.</bold> (a) Correlation matrix of all immunoglobulin variables in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from the training dataset (N&#x003D;175). Defining five clusters based on hierarchical clustering showed that IgA N and IgM N clustered separately from other IgA and IgM variables.

Patients were stratified according to time since first diagnosis to investigate early (less than 30 days post symptoms onset, lavender) and late (more than 30 days symptoms onset, turquoise) neutralization responses. Difference between these two groups was assessed with a linear mixed model with time since symptom onset (binary variable early/late) as fixed effect and individual as random effect and using a Wald test on the parameter associated with time since symptom onset (&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;p&#x003C;0.001).

(b) Linear mixed model, with time since symptom onset as fixed effect and individual as random effect, estimating the decay of antibody binding activity based on ABCORA 2.0 measurements at 1-4 longitudinal time points in 120 individuals totaling in 251 measurements. Orange lines correspond to the models estimation and orange shaded areas to the 95% confidence intervals. Antibody half-lives (t1/2 in days) from significant models are depicted. Significance was assessed using Wald tests on the slope parameters. (c) Linear mixed model estimating the decay of neutralizing capacity in patients separated by their neutralizing activity. Only individuals with NT50&#x003E;100 at their first measurement were used to estimate the half-life. The black line corresponds to the model estimation and the grey shaded area to the 95% confidence interval.</p>
