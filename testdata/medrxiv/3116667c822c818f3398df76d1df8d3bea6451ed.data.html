<meta name="DC.Description" content="The incidence of diagnostic delays is unknown for many diseases and particular healthcare settings. Many existing methods to identify diagnostic delays are resource intensive or inapplicable to various diseases or settings. In this paper we propose a comprehensive framework to estimate the frequency of missed diagnostic opportunities for a given disease using real-world longitudinal data sources. We start by providing a conceptual model of the disease-diagnostic, data-generating process. We then propose a simulation-based method to estimate measures of the frequency of missed diagnostic opportunities and duration of delays. This approach is specifically designed to identify missed diagnostic opportunities based on signs and symptoms that occur prior to an initial diagnosis, while accounting for expected patterns of healthcare that may appear as coincidental symptoms. Three different simulation algorithms are described for implementing this approach. We summarize estimation procedures that may be used to parameterize the simulation. Finally, we apply our approach to the diseases of tuberculosis, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke and evaluate the estimated frequency and duration of diagnostic delays for these diseases. Our approach can be customized to fit a range of disease and we summarize how the choice of simulation algorithm may impact the resulting estimates.

### Author Declarations

I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

Yes

The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:

The IBM MarketScan Research Databases are commercially available de-itentified administrative claims datasets. The collection of these data along with the process for de-identifying records is the intellectual property of IBM MarketScan. Because of the absence of individual identifiers in the MarketScan data, the University of Iowa's Institutional Review Board views this as non-human-subjects research and exempt from IRB oversight.

I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.

Yes

I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).

Yes

I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.

Yes

This study used data from the IBM MarketScan Research Databases. These are commercially available de-itentified administrative claims datasets, that can be obtained from IBM MarketScan.

Many existing methods to identify diagnostic delays are resource intensive or inapplicable to various diseases or settings. In this paper we propose a comprehensive framework to estimate the frequency of missed diagnostic opportunities for a given disease using real-world longitudinal data sources. We start by providing a conceptual model of the disease-diagnostic, data-generating process. We then propose a simulation-based method to estimate measures of the frequency of missed diagnostic opportunities and duration of delays. This approach is specifically designed to identify missed diagnostic opportunities based on signs and symptoms that occur prior to an initial diagnosis, while accounting for expected patterns of healthcare that may appear as coincidental symptoms. Three different simulation algorithms are described for implementing this approach. We summarize estimation procedures that may be used to parameterize the simulation. Finally, we apply our approach to the diseases of tuberculosis, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke and evaluate the estimated frequency and duration of diagnostic delays for these diseases. Our approach can be customized to fit a range of disease and we summarize how the choice of simulation algorithm may impact the resulting estimates.</p></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-4">The authors have declared no competing interest.</p><h3>Funding Statement</h3><p id="p-5">This study was funded by a grant from The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (grant number R01HS027375)</p><h3>Author Declarations</h3><p id="p-6">I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.</p><p id="p-7">Yes</p><p id="p-8">The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:</p><p id="p-9">The IBM MarketScan Research Databases are commercially available de-itentified administrative claims datasets.
