Method A systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies from December 2019 to September 2021 was performed to identify studies that reported COVID-19 related hospitalization in IBD patients receiving biological therapies or tofacitinib.

The use of vedolizumab [RR= 1.13 (95% CI: 0.75-1.73, p =0.56] and tofacitinib [RR= 0.81 (95% CI: 0.49-1.33, p =0.40] was not associated with lower risk of COVID-19 related hospitalization.

Conclusion Regarding COVID-19 related hospitalization in IBD, anti-TNFs and ustekinumab were associated with favorable outcomes. In addition, vedolizumab and tofacitinib were not associated with COVID-19 related hospitalization.

We aim to assess the association between risk of COVID-19 related hospitalization and these agents.</p></div><div id="sec-2" class="subsection"><p id="p-18"><strong>Method</strong> A systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies from December 2019 to September 2021 was performed to identify studies that reported COVID-19 related hospitalization in IBD patients receiving biological therapies or tofacitinib. The risk ratio (RR) was calculated to compare the relative risk of COVID-19 related hospitalization in patients receiving these medications to those who were not, at the time of the study.</p></div><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><p id="p-19"><strong>Results</strong> 18 studies were included. The relative risk of hospitalization was significantly lower in patients with IBD and COVID-19 who were receiving biologic therapy with RR of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.42-0.52, p &lt; 0.00001). The RR was lower in patients receiving anti-TNFs compared to those who did not [RR= 0.48 (95% CI: 0.41-0.55, p &lt; 0.00001)]. Similar finding was observed in patients taking ustekinumab [RR= 0.55 (95% CI: 0.43-0.72, p &lt; 0.00001)]. Combination therapy of anti-TNF and an immunomodulator did not lower the risk of COVID-19 related hospitalization [RR= 0.98 (95% CI: 0.82-1.18, p =0.84]. The use of vedolizumab [RR= 1.13 (95% CI: 0.75-1.73, p =0.56] and tofacitinib [RR= 0.81 (95% CI: 0.49-1.33, p =0.40] was not associated with lower risk of COVID-19 related hospitalization.</p></div><div id="sec-4" class="subsection"><p id="p-20"><strong>Conclusion</strong> Regarding COVID-19 related hospitalization in IBD, anti-TNFs and ustekinumab were associated with favorable outcomes. In addition, vedolizumab and tofacitinib were not associated with COVID-19 related hospitalization.</p></div></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-21">The authors have declared no competing interest.</p><h3>Funding Statement</h3><p id="p-22">This study did not receive any funding</p><h3>Author Declarations</h3><p id="p-23">I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.</p><p id="p-24">Yes</p><p id="p-25">I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.</p><p id="p-26">Yes</p><p id="p-27">I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
