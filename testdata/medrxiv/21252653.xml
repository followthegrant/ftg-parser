<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Aim</title>
<p>People with rheumatic diseases (PRD) remain vulnerable in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. We formulated recommendations to meet the urgent need for a consensus for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Systematic literature reviews were performed to evaluate (1) outcomes in PRD with COVID-19; (2) efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccination; and (3) published guidelines/recommendations for non-live, non-COVID-19 vaccinations in PRD. Recommendations were formulated based on the evidence and expert opinion according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>The consensus comprises two overarching principles and seven recommendations. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD should be aligned with prevailing national policy and should be individualized through shared decision between the healthcare provider and patient. We strongly recommended that eligible PRD and household contacts be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. We conditionally recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered during quiescent disease if possible. Immunomodulatory drugs, other than rituximab, can be continued alongside vaccination. We conditionally recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered prior to commencing rituximab if possible. For patients on rituximab, the vaccine should be administered a minimum of 6 months after the last dose and/or 4 weeks prior to the next dose of rituximab. Post-vaccination antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 need not be measured. Any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines may be used, with no particular preference.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These recommendations provide guidance for COVID-19 vaccination in PRD. Most recommendations in this consensus are conditional, reflecting a lack of evidence or low-level evidence.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The global novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed many uncertainties among physicians treating people with rheumatic diseases (PRD). Such patients are considered high risk due to their diseases and the immunosuppressive nature of their medications. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that PRD had a two-fold risk of COVID-19 compared to control patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In addition, PRD with COVID-19 had a higher fatality rate and were at significant risk of suffering poor outcomes such as the need for hospitalization, care in the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>Various candidate vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are in development. The first two COVID-19 vaccines to receive approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), the Pfizer-BioNTech&#x00AE; COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) and the Moderna&#x00AE; COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), reported excellent vaccine efficacy at 95&#x0025; and 94.1&#x0025;, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). However, patients on immunosuppressive therapy were excluded from both trials. Additionally, patients with autoimmune diseases were excluded from the Moderna&#x00AE; trial, and only 62 PRD (0.3&#x0025; of the total study population, but without detailed information) were included in the treatment arm of the Pfizer-BioNTech&#x00AE; trial. Thus, there is a paucity of evidence for PRD and their managing physicians to guide COVID-19 vaccination in this population.</p>
<p>The Singapore Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> and Moderna<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> COVID-19 mRNA vaccines via the Pandemic Special Access Route, and the Ministry of Health, Singapore (MOH) Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) has published recommendations for their use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) with other vaccines to be evaluated at a later date. Worldwide, four additional vaccines, namely from Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology (Gam-COVID-Vac or Sputnik V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), Oxford-Astra-Zeneca&#x00AE; (AZD1222) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), Johnson &#x0026; Johnson&#x00AE; (JNJ-78436735) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) and Novavax&#x00AE; (NVX-CoV2373) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), have so far published or announced interim Phase 3 efficacy data and are either already authorised or expected to apply for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in several countries. In this consensus recommendation, the Chapter of Rheumatologists, College of Physicians, Academy of Medicine, Singapore seeks to address questions regarding the suitability of COVID-19 vaccination in PRD and provide consensus recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination among PRD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A Core Working Group (CWG) was established (AS, CX, WF, ML). Members of the CWG reviewed published primary clinical trials and performed a systematic literature review to answer four research questions. Where appropriate, in lieu of a systematic review of the primary literature, international best practice guidelines and recommendations from rheumatology societies on vaccinations in PRD were reviewed. Other academic bodies&#x2019; recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination and other non-live, non-COVID-19 vaccinations in PRD and / or immunocompromising conditions were also considered. The CWG developed draft recommendations for rating by an invited task force panel (TFP). A modified Delphi approach, similar to what has been applied by other organizations, was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The TFP (TA, KOK, AL, THL, KHL, AHLL, MKS, TCT, GGT, BYT) comprised eight locally recognized adult rheumatologists from public and private healthcare institutions in Singapore, one paediatric rheumatologist and one infectious diseases specialist. A conflict-of-interest declaration was required from all members of the CWG and TFP prior to the consensus process. All members declared no conflict of interest.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Review of the literature</title>
<p>The CWG sent out preselected topics to the TFP and sought their input on additional clinically important topics. Considering the TFP&#x2019;s input, the CWG selected the following core topics relevant to clinical decision-making for COVID-19 vaccination:</p>
<p><italic>1. Are PRD at increased risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19?</italic></p>
<p>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of global data showed that PRD remain vulnerable, with substantial rates of severe outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The overall rates of hospitalization, oxygen support, ICU admission and fatality among COVID-19 infected patients with rheumatic diseases were 58&#x0025; (95&#x0025; confidence interval (CI) 48&#x0025; - 67&#x0025;), 33&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI 21&#x0025; - 47&#x0025;), 9&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI 5&#x0025; - 15&#x0025;) and 7&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI 3&#x0025; - 11&#x0025;), respectively, which are comparable with data from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance (GRA) physician registry. The fatality rate was higher both in this meta-analysis and the COVID-19 GRA (7.0&#x0025; and 6.7&#x0025;, respectively) than that (3.4&#x0025;) of general population infected with COVID-19 in the WHO database, although age, gender and comorbidities were not matched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). D&#x2019;Silva <italic>et al</italic> reported a higher risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, renal replacement therapy and death based on TriNetX, a multi-center research network with real-time electronic health record data across 35 healthcare organizations in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The authors concluded that these outcomes were likely mediated by a higher comorbidities burden in PRD, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease and asthma.</p>
<p><italic>2. Are existing approved vaccines against SARS CoV2 safe, immunogenic and efficacious in PRD?</italic></p>
<p>Two mRNA vaccines are currently approved by the US FDA and Singapore HSA. It is known that selected DNA and RNA molecules have the unique property to activate the immune system, through activation of Toll-like receptors. It has been shown that the innate immune response would be suppressed by nucleoside modification of RNA, as the innate immune system detects RNA lacking nucleoside modification as a means of selectively responding to bacteria or viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> and Moderna<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> are nucleoside-modified RNA. Thus, the risk of autoimmune disease flare after receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may more likely result from the adaptive immune response to spike protein synthesized by mRNA, rather than the innate immune response to nucleoside-modified RNA. Theoretically, this is no different from the risk from other protein / conjugate vaccines, which have been in use for many years and have been confirmed to be safe in PRD.</p>
<p>There were 62 (0.3&#x0025;) participants who had rheumatic disease and received BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in the Pfizer/BioNTech<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). No flare of autoimmune disease was reported. Certainly, larger sample size and long-term follow-up studies are needed to further ascertain the risk of flares in autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>Other vaccine strategies, including inactivated virus vaccines (such as the CoronaVac developed by Sinovac<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>)), virus vector vaccines (such as the COVID-19 vaccines by AstraZeneca<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) and the Sputnik V<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Russian vaccine by Gamaleya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) and protein subunit vaccines (such as the Novavax<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>)) similarly provide little data in PRD. Pertinent information from primary COVID-19 vaccine trials to date are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="21252653v1_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>There are currently no available data on the immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in PRD.</p>
<p><italic>3. Are other (non-COVID-19) recommended non-live vaccines safe, immunogenic and efficacious in PRD?</italic></p>
<p><italic>4. What is the effect of various drugs used in PRD on immunogenicity of (non-COVID-19) vaccines in PRD?</italic></p>
<p>To review the evidence in non-live, non-COVID-19 vaccinations in PRD, a systematic review of international best practice guidelines and recommendations from rheumatology societies on vaccinations in PRD was performed, in lieu of a systematic review of the primary literature. We searched PubMed for publications using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms (&#x201C;Consensus&#x201D;[MeSH] OR &#x201C;Consensus Development Conference, NIH&#x201D; [Publication Type] OR &#x201C;Consensus Development Conference&#x201D; [Publication Type] OR &#x201C;Consensus Development Conferences, NIH&#x201D;[MeSH] OR &#x201C;Consensus Development Conferences&#x201D;[MeSH]) OR (&#x201C;Guidelines as Topic&#x201D; [MeSH] OR &#x201C;Practice Guidelines as Topic&#x201D; [MeSH] OR &#x201C;Guideline&#x201D; [Publication Type] OR &#x201C;Health Planning Guidelines&#x201D; [MeSH] OR &#x201C;Standard of Care&#x201D; [MeSH] OR &#x201C;Practice Guideline&#x201D; [Publication Type] OR &#x201C;Clinical Protocols&#x201D; [MeSH] AND ((vaccine[MeSH Terms]) OR (vaccination[MeSH Terms])) OR (active immunization[MeSH Terms]) AND ((((autoimmune disease[MeSH Terms]) OR (rheumatology[MeSH Terms])) OR (host, immunocompromised[MeSH Terms])) OR (immunocompromised host[MeSH Terms])) OR (immunocompromised patient[MeSH Terms]). The filters English (language) and Humans were applied. This search yielded 191 citations. One member of the CWG (ML) screened through the titles and/or abstracts and excluded those that were not a practice guideline, not targeted to PRD, only addressed live vaccines, were only targeted to childhood vaccines, did not undertake a systematic literature review, were duplicates, or were outdated recommendations from the same body. Four additional citations were added from manual search. We then reviewed the remaining 21 full text articles and excluded best practice guidelines that did not undertake a consensus methodology and evidence grading or strength of recommendations. Eleven full text articles were finally included (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>).

<title>Creation of preliminary statements and rating</title>
<p>The CWG met to formulate and finalize preliminary statements for rating by the TFP, which was conducted on an online survey platform. The TFP were provided with summarized evidence from the reviewed trials and guidelines, a link to an online rating form and rating instructions. Based on their expertise and the provided literature, each TFP member independently rated each statement on a five-point Likert scale (1 &#x003D; strongly disagree, 2 &#x003D; disagree, 3 &#x003D; neutral, 4 &#x003D; agree, 5 &#x003D; strongly agree); an agreement was defined as a score of 4 or 5. A consensus was obtained if there was &#x2265;70&#x0025; agreement. The CWG and the TFP convened via a teleconferencing platform, where the aggregated findings were presented and discussed. Definitions were clarified and statements were reworded, if needed. As there was consensus on all statements following the online voting round, no further round of voting was conducted. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) was used to determine the strength of recommendations. In determining the strength of recommendations, the TFP considered the level of evidence available, as well as the balance between the potentially expected benefits and risks from COVID-19 vaccination/ omission of vaccination in PRD. Recommendations were categorized as &#x201C;strong&#x201D; when benefits/risks clearly outweighed the other, and &#x201C;conditional&#x201D; when benefits/risks were closely balanced or uncertain.</p>

<title>Vaccination in PRD should be aligned with prevailing national policy</title>
<p>The knowledge on COVID-19 vaccination is rapidly evolving with various candidate vaccines still undergoing clinical trials. As new evidence becomes available, the landscape of vaccine availability in each country will likely differ. It is important that healthcare professionals align their recommendations to prevailing national policy, to ensure consistency of messages to patients and maintain streamlined safety workflows. Vaccine safety monitoring systems, such as the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) are in place to detect possible safety signals in the vaccinated population. Locally, the HSA reviews all reports of post-vaccination reactions, to inform national policy of vaccine eligibility, monitoring and precautions.</p>

<title>The decision for vaccination should be individualised, and should be explained to the patient, to provide a basis for shared decision-making between the healthcare provider and the patient</title>
<p>The Rheumatologists&#x2019; decision for offering vaccinations to their patients should take into account the individual patient&#x2019;s disease state, medications, as well as their risk profile and preferences. Patients should be provided with evidenced-based information to enable them to participate in a shared decision-making process. Information should include the potential risks and benefits from vaccination (or its omission), the vaccination schedule and a discussion of the various available vaccines.</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<sec id="s3b1">
<label>1.</label>
<title>We strongly recommend that eligible patients be vaccinated against SARS-CoV2</title>
<p>PRD are a vulnerable patient population at increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) and suffering severe outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). While there is little data on mRNA vaccination in PRD, there are no reports of autoimmune disease flares in the small group of PRD included in the Pfizer/BioNTech<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). There is an isolated report of a healthy individual who was diagnosed with fatal immune thrombocytopenia six days after COVID-19 vaccination with no clear evidence of the development of a new autoimmune disease. While there was temporal association, it could not be fully concluded that the vaccine was definitely the cause for the patient&#x2019;s presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). To our knowledge, there are no other reports of autoimmune disease induction or flare after COVID-19 vaccination in the more than 100 million people vaccinated worldwide to date. COVID-19 vaccination should therefore be strongly recommended for PRD given the vulnerability of PRD along with good efficacy, immunogenicity and favourable safety profile of COVID-19 vaccination in healthy patients. This is in line with recommendations endorsed by the British Society of Rheumatology for clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), which includes PRD and the recent press release from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) similarly places immunocompromised persons at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and recommends that these patients receive vaccination as long as there are no contraindications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b2">
<label>2.</label>
<title>We conditionally recommend that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered during quiescent disease, if possible</title>
<p>This recommendation is extrapolated from other vaccine recommendations in PRD, and is largely based on expert opinion, hence the conditional strength of recommendation. Vaccination studies in PRD have been largely conducted during quiescent disease state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and thus have limited generalizability to the PRD population with active disease, though isolated studies have shown similar vaccine immunogenicity regardless of disease state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). The decision for vaccination in patients whose disease is not quiescent should be considered on an individual patient level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b3">
<label>3.</label>
<title>We conditionally recommend that immunomodulatory drugs, other than rituximab, can be continued alongside COVID-19 vaccination</title>
<p>Vaccination studies in PRD on immunomodulatory drugs (other than B cell depleting therapy) have shown sufficient protective efficacy with common non-live vaccines including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, despite somewhat reduced immunogenicity particularly with methotrexate and abatacept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b4">
<label>4.</label>
<title>We conditionally recommend that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered prior to commencing rituximab, if possible. For patients on rituximab, the vaccine should be administered a minimum of 6 months after the last dose, and/or 4 weeks prior to the next dose of rituximab</title>
<p>B cell depleting therapy with rituximab is associated with significant reduction in immunogenicity. Despite reduced humoral immune response, cellular immune response is still preserved after influenza vaccination in patients who were treated with rituximab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Satisfactory immunogenicity has been shown in rituximab treated patients when influenza and pneumococcal vaccines were administered 6 months after a previous dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) and at least 4 weeks prior to a subsequent dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), forming the basis of this conditional recommendation. Of note, the British Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance recommends that vaccination should not be delayed in patients on or planned for rituximab, with an ideal interval of vaccination 4-8 weeks after the last dose of rituximab or 2 weeks prior to a planned dose of rituximab, if possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b5">
<label>5.</label>
<title>We conditionally recommend that post-COVID-19 vaccination antibody titres need not be measured</title>
<p>Outside of paediatric care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), post-vaccination antibody titre measurement is not part of routine clinical practice and is not part of other vaccination guidelines in adult PRD. As the correlation between antibody titres post COVID-19 vaccination and clinical protection is not well established at present, we conditionally recommend that titres not be measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b6">
<label>6.</label>
<title>We strongly recommend that household contacts be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p>Vaccination of household contacts has been advocated by societies such as European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) for a variety of inactivated and live vaccines (except for the oral polio vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>)). Increasingly, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in close contacts due to asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), highlighting the importance of extending vaccinations to household contacts in order to protect vulnerable patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b7">
<label>7.</label>
<title>We conditionally recommend that any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines may be used, with no particular preference</title>
<p>The various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development are non-live vaccines. The anticipated risk benefit ratio should therefore be similar for vaccinations to be recommended without preference for any particular vaccine. However, long term follow-up in PRD will be needed to ascertain longer term efficacy and safety of the various vaccines.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The consensus recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in PRD presented in this article were based on review of the limited currently available literature with these vaccines, supplemented by the more extensive knowledge that is available for other non-live vaccines in PRD. It is noteworthy that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and practical recommendations for PRD need to be made despite the scarcity of literature in these vulnerable patients. Experts in the specialty were consulted, in order to synthesize the available literature into clinically meaningful recommendations. Available evidence on the risk of COVID-19 in PRD was weighed against the potential risks / benefits of vaccination with a new vaccine technology, borrowing from the principles of vaccination with non-live viruses in PRD and the available knowledge on mRNA drug delivery systems.</p>
<p>In formulating these recommendations, the TFP were cognizant of the heightened risk of COVID-19 in our patients. Therefore, recommendations were formulated to aid practicing rheumatologists in their decision making without being overly restrictive, while allowing individualized decision making for each patient. These should take into account patient&#x2019;s disease status, ongoing treatment, risk profiles, preferences and local community transmission risk.</p>
<p>Our consensus recommendations for COVID-19 vaccinations in PRD were developed employing a systematic literature review and Delphi method. The process of recommendation development incorporated all components of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research &#x0026; Evaluation (AGREE) instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), other than patient/ allied health involvement, for practicality. The AGREE framework was developed to ensure the rigor of guideline formulation which are feasible for clinical practice. The only other consensus recommendations developed using a standardised Delphi method for COVID-19 vaccination in PRD were recently announced in a press release by the American College of Rheumatology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Importantly, the broad principles for COVID-19 vaccination in PRD in our recommendations are similar to what the ACR has outlined, in spite of the vastly different pandemic situation (and therefore the balance of risk/ benefit of the vaccine) in Asia versus North America. Vaccination is strongly encouraged, may be given while on immunomodulatory therapy, preferably during quiescent disease, and without the need for testing for post-vaccination antibody titres. The ACR recommended that COVID-19 vaccination should be timed according to the dosing of certain immunomodulatory treatments (rituximab, intravenous abatacept and intravenous cyclophosphamide) and that treatment with methotrexate, Janus Kinase inhibitors and abatacept should be temporarily interrupted prior to or after COVID-19 vaccination. However, as discussed, while there may be reduced vaccine immunogenicity in patients on these medications, sufficient protective efficacy has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), thus forming the basis of our recommendation to vaccinate without treatment interruption or consideration for timing of doses.</p>
<p>As of the latest WHO update on February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2021, 66 candidate vaccines are in clinical development, with a further 176 in pre-clinical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Since the roll out of vaccination campaigns in various regions in mid-December 2020 up to February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2021, more than 165 million vaccine doses have been administered worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) and our collective experience with the new vaccines continue to evolve. It is important that governing institutions and healthcare providers continue to keep abreast of the latest evidence, so that recommendations can be reviewed and/or revised as new knowledge emerges. Particularly, data on safety and efficacy of vaccination in PRD are urgently needed to update recommendations in this vulnerable population.</p>
