<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Objectives</title>
<p>The risk of serious health consequences of tobacco use is much higher for people living with HIV than for the general population. Nevertheless, HIV-positive individuals smoke cigarettes 2-3 times more often than others. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cigarette smoking among HIV-positive patients in Poland.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Design</title>
<p>Data comes from the survey conducted among 204 HIV-positive patients in the period from November 2018 to November 2019.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The characteristics in the survey included: sex; age; present and past smoking habits: the number of cigarettes smoked per day, the number of years as a smoker; the influence of HIV diagnosis on the number of cigarettes smoked.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Among all patients, 56.4&#x0025; (55.1&#x0025; of all male and 64.3&#x0025; of all female) were current or former smokers. Among the smokers, 25.2&#x0025; changed their smoking habits after being diagnosed with HIV: 89.7&#x0025; increased and 10.3&#x0025; decreased the number of cigarettes smoked.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Prevalence of tobacco use among HIV-positive individuals in Poland decreased since 2009, but is still much higher than in the general population. The outcome indicates the need to improve smoking education provided by HIV care professionals. Smoking cessation treatment should become an integral part of HIV care for patients to fully benefit from antiretroviral therapy.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to the World Health Organisation, tobacco use remains one of the major causes of death, killing 8 million people every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The WHO report from 2016 estimates the prevalence of smoking as 22&#x0025; worldwide and 28&#x0025; in Poland (32&#x0025; of men and 24&#x0025; of women) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>].</p>
<p>In some populations prevalence of smoking is still much higher than in general. People living with HIV smoke cigarettes 2-3 times more often than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In the study conducted in 2009 in Poland among 116 HIV-positive patients, 87&#x0025; had been smoking cigarettes longer than 5 years (85&#x0025; of men and 94&#x0025; of women) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Nowadays, due to the advance of antiretroviral treatment, people living with HIV are more likely to die from non-AIDS-related than AIDS-related causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Tobacco use has a significant contribution to worsening their quality of life and shortening the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Smoking HIV-positive individuals are more likely than HIV-positive nonsmokers to develop lung, head and neck, and other cancers, heart disease, stroke, COPD, bacterial and pneumocystis pneumonia, oral candidiasis and oral hairy leukoplakia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Among non-AIDS-related death causes neoplasms are one of the most significant for people living with HIV. According to research conducted in the United States, seropositive smokers are 6-13 times more likely to die from lung cancer than AIDS-related causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Studies show that tobacco use results in a poorer response to antiretroviral therapy. Seropositive smokers also experience more difficulty quitting than seronegative people due to higher cotinine blood levels. Involving the same liver cytochromes in tobacco and antiretroviral medications metabolism effects in increased dose need in nicotine replacement therapy. This association is more significant in women, indicating more serious health consequences and worse results in quit attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cigarette smoking among HIV-positive patients in Poland comparing to results from 2009.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted a survey among HIV-positive patients in our department in the period from November 2018 to November 2019.</p>
<p>The characteristics included: sex; age; present and past smoking habits: the number of cigarettes smoked per day, the number of years as a smoker; the influence of HIV diagnosis on the number of cigarettes smoked.</p>
<p>To classify patients as current or former smokers we used CDC National Health Interview Survey criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]: current smoker is an adult who has smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and who currently smokes cigarettes, former smoker is an adult who has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime but who had quit smoking at the time of interview, never smoker is an adult who has never smoked, or who has smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Patients were aged 19-82 years old, men 19-82 years old, women 30-65 years old.</p>
<p>Number for years as a smoker ranged from 1 to 50, for men 2-40, for women 1-50.</p>
<p>Number of cigarettes smoked per day ranged from 2 to 40, for men 2-40, for women 3-20.</p>
<p>Baseline data are presented in a table (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tabl. 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="20238949v1_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>In our results 97 (55.1&#x0025;) of all male and 18 (64.3&#x0025;) of all female patients were current or former smokers.</p>
<p>Among all smokers, 29 (25.2&#x0025;) patients admitted that diagnosing the HIV infection had an impact on their smoking habits: 26 (89.7&#x0025;) increased and 3 (10.3&#x0025;) decreased the number of cigarettes smoked. Three patients who reduced smoking because of diagnosis were male.</p>

<sec id="s4">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In Poland, in the period from 1985 to 30 September 2019, there were 25 020 cases of confirmed HIV infection, with 3 741 patients diagnosed with AIDS among whom 1 424 died [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], but still, there are not enough studies assessing the scale of tobacco use in this population. Comparing to data from other high-income countries, the prevalence of smoking among those patients in Poland seems to follow the trend: people living with HIV are more than twice as likely to smoke than others. In the study conducted in 2015 in the United States among 419 945 patients, 42.4&#x0025; were current smokers, 20.3&#x0025; were former smokers, and 37.3&#x0025; had never smoked, while in the general population in this country 20.6&#x0025; of adults smoked. Smoking HIV-positive individuals were also less likely to quit than HIV-negative smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The results of our study show a strong need to support cessation treatment, although research conducted by the Health Promotion Foundation in 2016 indicates the insufficient level of knowledge in this area among polish HIV care providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Doctors and nurses working with people living with HIV were asked about tobacco-related diseases, psychological support during cessation treatment, available cessation medicines. Researchers also evaluated how often doctors talk with their patients about smoking. Results show that HIV care professionals in Poland lack the essential knowledge needed to provide effective cessation treatment and often ignore this topic during medical visits. Respondents highlighted that the guidelines of the Polish AIDS Society should be expanded in the matter of smoking treatment.</p>
<p>A recent study conducted in Denmark shows that people living with HIV underestimate the harmful effects of tobacco use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Participants were asked to estimate their life expectancy. Self-perceived life expectancy among smokers was 3.65 years lower than among non-smokers, while studies show that smoking HIV-positive individuals have 12.3 years of life lost compared to HIV-positive non-smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Participants estimated life lost attributable to the HIV status as least as strong as due to current smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], however, researchers found tobacco use causing more than twice the number of years lost than HIV infection alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. In our study, 89.7&#x0025; of patients who admitted that diagnosing HIV infection had an impact on changing their smoking habits increased the number of cigarettes smoked. This result suggests inadequate awareness of the harmfulness of tobacco use in this group also in Poland.</p>
<p>In Danish research, the male sex was associated with a lower self-perceived life expectancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. In our study, those patients who decided to quit or reduce smoking after finding out their HIV status were all male. It may be also related to the suggestion that HIV-positive females experience more difficulty quitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. However, in the study among 2973 people living with HIV in China where 28.9&#x0025; of participants reduced, 19.0&#x0025; quit and only 8.2&#x0025; increased smoking after being tested HIV-positive, female sex was associated with quitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>In our study, comparing to the research from 2009, where almost 90&#x0025; of HIV-positive patients were smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], the prevalence of smoking in this group decreased. Nevertheless, it is still twice as high as in the general population.</p>
<p>Results show that diagnosing HIV infection plays a role in changing smoking habits. The fact that almost none of the patents decided to reduce or quit cigarettes after being diagnosed indicates the absence of sufficient, effective smoking education carried out by HIV care providers.</p>
<p>Smoking patients are not able to fully benefit from antiretroviral therapy, which nowadays increases life expectancy in people living with HIV to near-normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Providing cessation treatment for seropositive smokers should be an integral part of HIV care and one of its priorities.</p>
