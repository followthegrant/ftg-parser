<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Serological surveillance studies sometimes use presence of anti-nucleocapsid antibody as a marker of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. We explore seroconversion rates and antibody levels following Alpha and Delta variant infections, and vaccine breakthrough infections. We find lower seroconversion rates particularly following Alpha-variant vaccine breakthrough infections. We re-evaluate assay performance with a mix of past waned infections and recent breakthrough infections, that is relevant to current serological surveillance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>We explore the continued use of anti-nucleocapsid (N) antibody positivity as a marker of SARS-CoV-2 infections in serological surveillance studies following the introduction of vaccination and circulation of variants of concern. Recently, Allen et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] described data for 23 study participants who experienced a breakthrough infection 14&#x002B; days after their 2<sup>nd</sup> vaccine dose, of whom only 6 had detectable N antibodies 9-67 days post infection. If the sensitivity of the N assay is low for breakthrough infections, this has important implications for the interpretation of serological surveillance in a highly vaccinated population, such as UK blood donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. We describe and compare the distribution and seropositivity of convalescent N antibody results in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, following Alpha or Delta variant infections.</p>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>N antibodies following Alpha and Delta infections by vaccination status</title>
<p>Since February 2021 Public Health England have contacted a random sample of vaccine-eligible individuals identified from community testing data who had tested PCR-positive for COVID-19. The variant of each infection was determined by sequencing or S gene target failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] where available or assumed to be Alpha if the PCR date was before 03/05/2021 or Delta if the PCR date was after 24/05/2021. A convalescent blood sample was requested typically 4-6 weeks after infection. Sera were analysed using the Roche Elecsys anti-spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Convalescent N antibody results were available for 472 PCR positive cases recruited into the study. Individuals experienced infection between 08/02/2021-10/07/2021, with convalescent blood samples collected up to 11/08/2021. 24 were identified as having experienced past infection, either through self-report or N-positive sera taken during acute infection. At the time of infection, 143 were unvaccinated, 176 had received a single dose 21&#x002B; days prior and 80 were &#x2265;7 days fully vaccinated. Exclusion of those with infection &#x003C;21 days post dose 1 or re-infection left 379 individuals for study. The median age was 46 (min 19, max 87). 279 infections were allocated as Alpha variant, 88 Delta, 3 other lineages and 9 unknown. Samples were taken 22-100 days post onset or PCR positive with median 39 days, allowing at least 3 weeks for seroconversion.</p>
<p>Multivariable regression on log N levels to estimate the geometric mean ratio of antibody levels, and robust Poisson regression on N seropositivity to approximate prevalence ratios (PR), were carried out, including terms for vaccination status x variant interaction, age group, sex and a smoothing spline for days since onset (PCR date if unknown). Results are given in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, along with seropositivity and the median and interquartile range of levels.</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 1</label>
<graphic xlink:href="21264964v1_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>A marginal reduction in prevalence of detectable N antibody following an Alpha vaccine breakthrough infection compared with infection in unvaccinated was found (single dose PR = 0.93 [95&#x0025; CI 0.86 - 1.01, p=0.08]; fully vaccinated PR=0.84 [95&#x0025; CI 0.68 - 1.03, p=0.09]), but no similar reduction was found for Delta breakthrough infections (single dose PR=1.02 [95&#x0025; CI 0.93 - 1.11, p=0.69]; fully vaccinated PR = 0.98 [95&#x0025; CI 0.88 - 1.09, p = 0.68]).</p>
<p>We found a statistically significant reduction in geometric mean N antibody level following both single dose and full vaccination for both Alpha and Delta infections. This is evident in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, which depicts the distribution of Roche N levels by vaccination status and variant. Following Alpha infections, the lower tail of the distribution sitting below the assay cut-off visually has greater density among individuals who were fully vaccinated at the time of infection. For Delta, while the distribution of levels is shifted downward in breakthrough infections as compared with vaccine-absent infections, seropositivity appears unaffected.</p>

<title>Optimal assay cut-offs for current serosurveillance</title>
<p>The Roche N assay cut-off of 1 was set high to give a clinical specificity of 99.8&#x0025; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. We therefore explored an optimal cut-off of the Roche Elecsys anti-N assay by calculating the sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating curve (ROC) for a range of values. To supplement the full 472 convalescent results described above, we included 220 Roche N results from secondary school pupils and staff with a record of testing PCR positive &#x003E;21 days prior to sampling participating in the SKIDSplus study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], and a panel of 233 convalescent individuals recruited during 2020, many of whom experienced infection early in the pandemic. We used only the most recent sample taken during 2021, thus our convalescent data includes a mix of samples from individuals who experienced wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in the past (max 431 days post infection), and more recent infections likely to be Alpha or Delta variant (primarily Alpha) across a broad range of ages. Two panels of pre-covid baseline sera were used: 472 residual from hospitals and labs and 995 Oxford biobank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Of those &#x2265;9 months post infection, 91&#x0025; (106/116) were seropositive. A sensitivity of 97.2&#x0025; was previously reported 20-82 days post wild-type infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], but waning will have led to reduced sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> gives the sensitivity, specificity and area under ROC for a range of cut-offs. The manufacturers cut-off of 1 gives sensitivity 92.2&#x0025; and specificity 99.9&#x0025;. Area under ROC is maximised at 0.25, however the specificity of 99.0&#x0025; at 0.25 seems lower than ideal. We consider the specificity of 99.6&#x0025; at a cut-off of 0.4 to be preferable, which raises sensitivity to 94.1&#x0025;.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We conclude that N-antibody levels are lower following vaccination and differ by variant. Levels were generally higher following a Delta infection and seroconversion rates were unaffected by vaccination status at the time of infection. Even following Alpha infection for which levels were generally lower, 78&#x0025; fully vaccinated individuals seroconverted. This is proportionally considerably higher than the 26&#x0025; (6/23) found by Allen et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], however some sera were likely collected too soon to observe seroconversion (minimum 9 days), and 18 PCR positive individuals were asymptomatic, suggesting that seroconversion rates may be low following the very mildest infections. All Delta infections in our dataset were symptomatic, while 20/279 Alpha infections were asymptomatic. 65&#x0025; (13/20) of these asymptomatic Alpha infections resulted in N seroconversion, compared with 91&#x0025; (236/259) symptomatic Alpha infections (Fishers exact p=0.002).</p>
<p>Among those that did not seroconvert, &#x223C;27&#x0025; N levels were just below the threshold for positivity and we propose an equivocal range for the Roche Elecsys anti-N assay of 0.4-&#x003C;1, which can be used to improve sensitivity while retaining a high specificity of 99.6&#x0025;. Our convalescent data included mostly mild-moderate community past wild-type and more recent Alpha and Delta breakthrough infections, relevant to current serological surveillance. Sensitivity was estimated at 92.2&#x0025; with the manufacturers cut-off of 1 or 94.1&#x0025; using our proposed equivocal cut-off of 0.4.</p>
<p>Our findings mean that population estimates of N antibody seropositivity are likely to underestimate the proportion of the population who have experienced covid-19 in the highly-vaccinated UK population, particularly following an Alpha-variant wave or in younger populations who often experience mild infections, as well as due to waning. However, our data suggest that the majority do seroconvert, and that presence of N antibodies still serves as a reasonable marker for previous symptomatic infection regardless of vaccination status.</p>
