<p>A prospective cohort study from Boston Medical Center (BMC)&#x2019;s HCW vaccination program, where staff received two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases among HCWs from December 09, 2020 to February 23, 2021. Weekly SARS-CoV-2 rates per 100,000 person-day overall and by time from first injection (1-14 and &#x003E;14 days) were compared with surrounding community rates.

<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 cases occurred in 1.4&#x0025; (96/7109) of HCWs given at least a first dose and 0.3&#x0025; (17/5913) of HCWs given both vaccine doses. Adjusted SARS-CoV-2 infection rate ratios were 0.73 (95&#x0025; CI 0.53-1.00) 1-14 days and 0.18 (0.10-0.32) &#x003E;14 days from first dose. HCW SARS-CoV-2 cases &#x003E;14 days from initial dose compared to within 14 days were more often older (46 versus 38 years, p=0.007), Latinx (10&#x0025; versus 8&#x0025;, p=0.03), and asymptomatic (48&#x0025; versus 11&#x0025;, p=0.0002). SARS-CoV-2 rates among HCWs fell below those of the surrounding community, with a 18&#x0025; versus 11&#x0025; weekly decrease respectively (p=0.14).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>On December 15, 2020, Boston Medical Center (BMC), an urban, safety-net hospital, started offering its 10,590 healthcare workers (HCWs) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and then mRNA-1273 (Moderna). The vaccination campaign coincided with Massachusetts&#x2019; second surge, which peaked at 6,000 new daily COVID-19 cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Vaccine was not available to anyone in the general population until February 1, 2021. This allowed examination of vaccine effectiveness during a period of higher prevalence and increased SARS-CoV-2 viral diversity than in the initial clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Concerns exist that newer SARS-CoV-2 variants have increased infectivity, modest decrease in neutralizing activity, and may impact vaccine effectiveness via escape from vaccine-induced immunity, specifically by mutations in the spike protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Assessment of viral genome sequencing of time-matched cases from vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals is needed to see whether such selection is evident.</p>
<p>Our aims were threefold: 1) to compare infection rates among HCWs who did and did not receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 2) to compare infection rates over time between HCWs and the surrounding community in the months following the BMC vaccination initiative and, 3) to compare genomic and spike protein mutations between cases detected post-vaccination and among unvaccinated cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Boston University Medical Campus&#x2019; institutional review board approved the study. At BMC HCWs are screened daily for COVID-19 symptoms and tested if symptomatic. Asymptomatic testing is available to HCWs for workplace exposures, following out-of-state travel, and per request. All HCWs diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 complete contact tracing and clinical questionnaires. As BMC was a BNT162b2 trial site, 66 HCWs had been vaccinated prior to the vaccine initiative and were included in analyses.</p>
<p>We identified all HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between December 9, 2020 and February 23, 2021. We compared demographics and characteristics of cases detected post-vaccination by time since first dose to RT-PCR positive (1-14 days and &#x003E;14 days from first dose to RT-PCR) using Pearson chi-squared, Fisher&#x2019;s exact test, and Student t-tests. RT-PCR cycle threshold was dichotomized as above (negative) or below (positive) 24 across 5 instruments (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Appendix Table 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. We computed the crude weekly case rates by vaccination status at the time of the tests (unvaccinated, 1-14 days, and &#x003E;14 days from first dose to RT-PCR) as the number of weekly cases divided by person-days of follow-up during that week (Appendix text). To control for confounding from community trends in infection, we adjusted the rates using direct standardization to the weekly rates in Middlesex, Norfolk, and Suffolk counties in Massachusetts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. We compared the weekly decline in rates after December 30, 2020 (14 days after the vaccine initiative started) for BMC HCWs and the community using a negative binomial regression model including an interaction term between week and group (BMC HCW versus community) and an offset for person-day at risk.</p>
<p>Residual isolates available from HCW SARS-CoV-2 cases tested at BMC were amplified using a modified ARTIC-primer based protocol and sequenced on an Illumina platform. Nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions were identified with LoFreq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] following alignment to the Wuhan Hu-1 reference sequence (NC_045512.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] with Bowtie2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. We then restricted to cases from between January 1 and February 23, 2021 to time-match vaccinated and unvaccinated cases, which controlled for the expected accumulation of mutations due to the virus&#x2019;s high mutation rate. Significance calculations for synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations between vaccination groups used a Wilcoxon non-parametric test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, 67&#x0025; (7,109/10,590) of eligible HCWs were vaccinated with at least one dose. Post vaccination SARS-CoV-2 cases occurred in 96/7,109 (1.3&#x0025;) HCWs who received at least one dose, 17/5,913 (0.3&#x0025;) HCWs given both doses, and 329/3,481 (9.5&#x0025;) unvaccinated HCWs. Seventy percent (67/96) of post vaccination SARS-CoV-2 cases occurred within 14 days of the initial dose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). HCWs diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 &#x003E;14 days after first dose were more often older (46 vs 38 years, p=0.007), Latinx (10&#x0025; vs 8&#x0025;, p=0.03), asymptomatic (48&#x0025; vs 11&#x0025;, p=0.0002), afebrile (100&#x0025; vs 84&#x0025;, p=0.02), and trended toward receipt of BNT162b2 (69&#x0025; vs 48&#x0025;, p=0.06), compared to HCWs diagnosed within 14 days of first dose (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There was no difference in RT-PCR cycle threshold. The adjusted rate ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 0.73 (95&#x0025; CI 0.53,1.00) and 0.18 (0.10,0.32) for 1-14 days and &#x003E;14 days respectively from first dose compared to unvaccinated follow-up (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Following COVID-19 vaccine rollout to HCWs, case rates fell rapidly to below those of the community (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Appendix Figure 1</xref>). Though not statistically significant, the observed weekly decrease in case rates was faster among BMC HCW than the community (HCW RR: 0.82; Community RR: 0.89; p=0.14).</p>
<p>We sequenced isolates from 50&#x0025; (48/96) of SARS-CoV-2 cases diagnosed after at least the first vaccine dose. Sequences from 36 post-first vaccine SARS-CoV-2 cases and 51 unvaccinated cases were included in the time-matched analysis. Whole genome analysis identified 97 total nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the spike protein, with 64 and 68 SNVs among unvaccinated and post at least initial vaccine isolates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Of these SNVs, 35 were seen in both the unvaccinated and vaccinated cases, consistent with these infections occurring in an environment where similar variants were circulating. To determine whether there was greater accumulation of SNVs in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from either unvaccinated or vaccinated groups, we plotted the distribution of nonsynonymous SNVs between genomes in each population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). This analysis showed that most SNVs were found in one single genome from an individual case, with little accumulation of multiple mutations in either population. The exception to this trend were three mutations associated with the D614G variant which appeared in all genomes analyzed.</p>

<p>Analysis of the amino acid changes seen in vaccinated cases identified none with the antibody-evading 484K mutation. There were two amino acid changes (T1117A and N121D) seen in two separate infections (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis showed that in both cases these were two separate infections with the same closely related lineage, and not multiple separate acquisitions of the same mutation, which would suggest convergent evolution. While genome sequences from cases among vaccines &#x003E;14 days post first dose appeared more divergent from the original Wuhan-Hu-1 reference when compared with unvaccinated, this was no longer the case after controlling for the date of sampling; more recent samples are more divergent because more time has elapsed in which to accumulate mutations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our findings show SARS-CoV-2 vaccines decreased case rates at a time of high community prevalence and domestic circulation of concerning variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. While post vaccination SARS-CoV-2 cases do occur, the majority are in the two weeks following the first dose. We found adjusted rate reduction of new cases in vaccinated HCWs in days 1-14 and &#x003E;14 days post first dose versus unvaccinated of 27&#x0025; and 82&#x0025; respectively, similar to findings in the original clinical trials and more recently reported in Israel and other parts of the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Vaccine protection starts to have a greater impact in two weeks after the first vaccination dose. Individuals infected more than two weeks after first vaccination dose compared to before two weeks from first dose were older and reported fewer symptoms.</p>
<p>While we observed a strong decrease in rates among vaccinated versus unvaccinated individual HCWs, we did not observe a significant decrease in rates among HCWs versus the community in the months following the HCW vaccination initiative. This suggests that HCW case rates fell steeply from their peak during the surge, but then flattened to falling community rates, even at a time when few members of the community were eligible for vaccine. HCWs at greatest risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of the workplace may have chosen not to receive vaccine, something we could not adjust for with our data, but could lead to the plateau in population-level effectiveness. We were unable to adjust for markers such as a social vulnerability index; however, disparities in vaccination uptake exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] and may lead to reduced vaccine effectiveness when compared with expectations from trial results. Even when access is not an obstacle, as in the case of HCWs, vaccine hesitancy and other barriers will need to be better understood and addressed to reach the levels of population immunity necessary to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the meantime, mitigation measures such as masking, physical distancing, ventilation, and regular testing are still needed in hospital settings to protect both staff and patients. This is supported by recent modeling data suggesting that to avoid future outbreaks some mitigation measures will need to be maintained in the community at large even when high vaccine coverage is attained, as a result of the circulation of more transmissible variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Our data lacked follow-up from initial SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, so initially asymptomatic cases may have progressed to symptomatic disease in all groups. Additionally, though HCWs diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 more than 2 weeks from their initial dose were more likely to have received the BNT162b2 vaccine, this result likely reflects that BNT162b2 was given early when the force of infection was highest.</p>
<p>There is intense interest in, and anxiety over, the potential of vaccination to select for mutants against which vaccines are less effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. We found no early evidence of specific spike mutations or mutations associated with neutralizing vaccine escape, such as the E484K mutation. We observed overall genome divergence relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence as expected, with no evident increase of greater divergence in the Spike protein. Our study compared cases among vaccinees with those of contemporaneous unvaccinated individuals in the same population, which reflect the pool of virus to which vaccinated individuals were exposed, in order to avoid spurious associations between SNVs that happen to be locally common in different populations. It is a strength of this study that such time matched samples were available. We were also able to stratify participant samples by weeks from initial dose, not simply dichotomous vaccinated or unvaccinated, allowing observation of whether building immunity impacts the virus. Although we did not see clear trends, variation in the Spike sequence among vaccinated cases should be closely monitored by studies with larger sample size with careful consideration given to vaccine timing and comparison to concurrent unvaccinated controls.</p>
<p>Widespread vaccination does appear to impact case rates in real world campaigns. We must continue to improve vaccine coverage for all globally, educate about the need for vigilance in social distancing in the weeks following first dose, and carefully monitor for any ongoing viral evolution that impacts upon vaccine efficacy.</p>

<title>SARS-CoV-2 Rate Reductions Among BMC HCW by Vaccination Status: Full Methodology</title>
<p>Number of cases while unvaccinated, 1-14 days post vaccination and &#x003E;14 days post vaccination were specified by week between December 9<sup>th</sup> 2020 and February 24<sup>th</sup> 2021. For each BMC employee, person-day of follow-up at risk while unvaccinated started on December 9<sup>th</sup>, 2020 and ended at the earliest of infection date, date of first vaccination shot or February 24<sup>th</sup>, 2021. Person-day follow-up at risk 1-14 days post vaccination started on the day after the first vaccination shot and ended at the earliest of infection date, the date corresponding to 14 after the first vaccination shot or end of the study. Person-day follow-up at risk &#x003E;14 days post vaccination started 15 days after the first vaccination shot and ended at the earlier of infection date, or end of the study. Infection rates by vaccination status (unvaccinated, 1-14 post vaccination and &#x003E;14 days post-vaccination) were expressed as number of cases per 100,000 person-day follow-up at risk overall and by week. Adjustment for temporal trends of infection in the community was performed by direct standardization to the weekly rates in 3 counties including and surrounding Boston where most BMC employees live. Directly standardized rates of the study population (unvaccinated BMC employees) are weighted averages of the weekly rates, where the weights are corresponding strata population size in the community. Weekly cases and estimated population in the 3 counties were obtained from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health publicly available dashboard and US Census Bureau, respectively and were used to compute the weekly infection rates in the community as number of cases per 100,000 person-days at risk.</p>
