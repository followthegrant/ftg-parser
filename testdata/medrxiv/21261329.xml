<title>Summary</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>There currently exists limited and conflicting clinical data on the use of statins amongst COVID-19 patients. Given the both paucity and lack of consensus among data on statin&#x2019;s efficacy and safety amongst COVID-19 patients, the current guideline is to continue statin in COVID-19 patients, who have previously been treated with statins. The aim of this paper was to compare hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who did and did not receive statins, in terms of COVID-19 outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted population-based retrospective study using South Korea&#x2019;s nationwide healthcare database as of May 15 2020. We identified 4,349 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and aged 40 years or older. The cohort entry was defined as the date of hospitalization. Statin users were individuals with inpatient and outpatient prescription records of statins in the 240 days before cohort entry, and non-users were those without such records during this period. Our primary outcome was a composite endpoint of all-cause death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation use and cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction (MI), transient cerebral ischemic attacks (TIA) or stroke). We conducted inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95&#x0025; confidence intervals (CI), to compare outcomes between statin users and non-users.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Findings</title>
<p>1,115 patients were statin users (mean age = 65.9 years; 60&#x0025; female), and 3,234 were non-users (mean age = 58.3 years; 64&#x0025; female). Statin use was not associated with increased risk of the primary outcome (IPTW OR 0.82; 95&#x0025; CI: 0.60-1.11). Subgroup analysis showed a protective role of statins, for individuals with hypertension (IPTW OR 0.40; 95&#x0025; CI: 0.23-0.69, p for interaction: 0.0087).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>Given that statins are not detrimental and that it may be beneficial amongst hypertensive patients and relatively cheap, we would encourage further investigation into statin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.</p>

<sec>
<title>Research in context</title>
<sec>
<title>Evidence before this study</title>
<p>There is limited and conflicting data reporting on statin use among COVID-19 patients, and its association with COVID-19 outcomes</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Added value of this study</title>
<p>We report no difference in COVID-19 outcomes between patients who used and did not use statins prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, except in hypertensive patients in which statins was shown to have a protective effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
<p>As statins are not detrimental and relatively cheap, we encourage further investigation into statin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Since then, the daily number of global COVID-19 cases has increased from a few thousand in the beginning of March, to 50,000 at the end of March, to 100,000 in May, and to 200,000 in July<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The pathophysiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the COVID-19 disease, involves an overproduction of an early response proinflammatory cytokines, specifically tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6 and IL-1&#x03B2;)<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. If unabated, this cytokine storm subsequently places COVID-19 patients at increased risk of vascular hyperpermeability, multiorgan failure, and death<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As a result, statins have been suggested for use as a therapy for COVID-19. It is reported that statin can stabilize MYD88 at normal levels and reduce an ensuing cytokine storm<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Statins may also up-regulate ACE2, which is typically downregulated by SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates the infiltration of SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Statins can cause side effects of myalgia, increased creatine phosphokinase, and rhabdomyolysis and corresponding acute kidney injury, albeit quite rare; all these are reversible upon discontinuation of statins<sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There currently exists limited and conflicting clinical data on the use of statins amongst COVID-19 patients. While Zhang <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and Rodriguez-Nava <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> report that statin reduced the risk of mortality and/or disease severity, and Wang <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> reported an increased mortality among statin users, other studies<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> report no significant difference between statin users and non-users. Meanwhile, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 110,078 patients reported a reduced risk of mortality among those administered statins after their COVID-19 hospitalization, but no difference in patients who were administered statins before hospitalization<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Although there is a lack of consensus among data on statin&#x2019;s efficacy and safety amongst COVID-19 patients, the current recommendation is for COVID-19 patients to continue any antecedent statin use<sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Given the limited and conflicting data, there is a need for further investigation into the relationship between statin use and COVID-19 outcomes. The aim of this paper was to compare hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who did and did not receive statins, in terms of COVID-19 outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Data Source</title>
<p>We conducted a population-based cohort study using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) claims data released by the South Korean government. The HIRA is a sole nationwide governmental agency providing health insurance claims review, covering 98&#x0025; of the Korean population (about 50 million), and employs a fee-for-service reimbursement system<sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. In March 2020, the HIRA released its claim database for all COVID-19 patients in South Korea. This population-level claims dataset includes information on sociodemographic characteristics, healthcare utilization history, diagnosis results (International Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>th</sup> Revision<sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>; ICD-10) and prescription from both inpatient and outpatient settings. COVID-19 diagnosis was determined through the South Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) database. This database is the first nationwide dataset of COVID-19 patients. Details of the HIRA database are provided in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s8a">Supplementary Material 1</xref>.</p>
<p>This study was approved by the Human Investigation Review Board of Public Institutional Bioethics Committee designated by the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, which waived the requirement of informed consent due to retrospective study design and anonymity of the HIRA database (IRB # P01-2020-1262-001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Study Design and Participants</title>
<p>Between January 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020, 7,590 individuals tested positive for COVID-19. A positive COVID-19 result was defined as a positive result from South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety&#x2013;approved diagnostic tests that used a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction method<sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Individuals were excluded if they were younger than 40 years old, since younger patients are less likely to experience COVID-19 outcomes regardless of statin use. As well, we excluded individuals who were not hospitalized (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), for precise outcome assessment. As a result, 4,349 individuals were included in the sample cohort. Cohort entry was defined as the date of admission for COVID-19 hospitalization. Most of these patients were hospitalized until they fully recovered. A full recovery was defined as cessation of fever without medication use, and 2 consecutive negative test results within a 24 hour period<sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Statin Exposure</title>
<p>We defined exposure by using inpatient and outpatient prescription records of statin from the HIRA database (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s8b">Supplementary Material 2</xref>). Our definition follows an intention-to-treat approach. Patients prescribed statin within 240 days prior to cohort entry were regarded as statin users, and otherwise defined as non-users.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>We set the primary outcome as a composite endpoint of all-cause death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation use and cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction (MI), transient cerebral ischemic attacks (TIA) or stroke). Secondary outcomes were the individual components of the composite endpoint. These outcomes were defined using in-hospital ICD-10 diagnostic codes and the national procedure coding system (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s8b">Supplementary Material 2</xref>). We measured study outcomes between the date of cohort entry and the earliest of the date of hospital discharge or end of study period (May 15, 2020), whichever occurred earlier.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Potential Confounders</title>
<p>We included sociodemographic and clinical factors that are considered to be associated with both statin use and risk of the outcomes. For sociodemographic factors, we included age in years, square of age, sex, and health insurance type at cohort entry. We included clinical variables of 20 comorbidities and use of 12 co-medications. The ascertainment period to define comorbidities was from 3 years prior (&#x2212;1080d) through the start of the exposure ascertainment (&#x2212;240d). The ascertainment period to define co-medications was from 2 years prior (&#x2212;720d) through &#x2212;240d. We defined comorbidity variables from in-hospital ICD-10 diagnostic codes and co-medications from in/out-hospital anatomical therapeutic chemical codes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s8b">Supplementary Material 2</xref>). When defining malignancy, we additionally used the expanded benefit codes in addition to diagnosis codes to reduce false-positives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>We summarized the baseline characteristics for statin users and non-users using mean and standard deviation for continuous variables, and frequency and percentage for categorical variables. We investigated imbalance of distribution of covariates between statin users and non-users using absolute standardized difference (aSD). An aSD &#x2264; 0.1 was preferred for balance.</p>
<p>We employed the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjustment approach in order to reduce the confounding bias of statin users. Propensity score (PS) was estimated by a logistic regression with baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics as predictors (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We assigned the IPTW weight to each individual in the cohort, 1/PS to the statin users, and 1/(1-PS) to the non-users and constructed a balanced pseudo-population. Weighted univariable logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the effect of statin use on primary and secondary outcomes. For comparison, we also considered unweighted logistic regression: both univariable and multivariable, adjusted for age, sex, insurance type, history of diabetes and history of hypertension. For each logistic regression model, we reported the estimated odds ratio (OR) and its 95&#x0025; confidence interval (CI).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="21261329v2_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Subgroup Analyses</title>
<p>We stratified the cohort by (1) age (&#x003C;65 and &#x2265; 65 years) and (2) sex for the risk of the primary outcome. We also considered stratification by the history of (3) hyperlipidemia, (4) hypertension, and (5) diabetes mellitus. For each subgroup analysis, we recalculated PS by multivariable logistic regression. We obtained p for interaction by each subgroup.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Sensitivity Analyses</title>
<p>We conducted sensitivity analyses by extending the scope of the study population in two settings. The first setting was to redefine the study population by relaxing the hospitalization condition. That is, we included all confirmed positive individuals of at least 40 years of age regardless of their hospitalization record. The second setting was to extend the time window for exposure. To capture the patients who infrequently received statin prescription, we extended the time window for ascertaining exposure from 240 to 360 days, prior to cohort entry.</p>
<p>To investigate the sensitivity of results against the choices of statistical methods, we considered the following alternative approaches. First, we repeated the main IPTW analysis with discarding individuals with extreme PS values, PS &#x003C; 0.025 or PS &#x003E; 0.975 (IPTW with trimming). Second, in our unweighted multivariable logistic regression models, we included the estimated PSs as an additional predictor to other covariates (outcome adjustment model). Third, we applied the stabilized mortality ratio weighting, 1 for the user group and PS/(1-PS) for the non-user group, instead of IPTW (SMR weighting). Lastly, we considered propensity score matching (PS matching).</p>
<p>A two-sided p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using R 3.5.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 4,349 adults of at least 40 years of age were hospitalized with COVID-19 in South Korea between January 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020 and included this analysis. Of these, 1,115 (27&#x0025;) were statin users. Statin users were older than non-users on average (65.9 &#x00B1; 11.2 vs 58.3 &#x00B1; 12.3). Among statin users, 39.6&#x0025; of statin users were males, whereas 36.1&#x0025; of non-users were male. A larger proportion of statin users had comorbidities of chronic lung disease (50.6&#x0025; vs 24.6&#x0025;), diabetes mellitus (40.3&#x0025; vs 10.7&#x0025;), hyperlipidemia (65.4&#x0025; vs 18.1&#x0025;), and hypertension (53.5&#x0025; vs 17.7&#x0025;), relative to non-users. Statin users also used more antidiabetic (35.6&#x0025; vs 6.4&#x0025;) and antiplatelet (37.7&#x0025; vs 7.9&#x0025;) medications (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Among 530 primary composite events of all-cause death, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation use and cardiovascular adverse outcomes, 362 occurred in non-users (11.2&#x0025;; 362/3234) and 168 (15.1&#x0025;; 168/1115) in statin users. No difference was noted between statin users and non-users in the IPTW weighted analysis (IPTW adjusted OR 0.82; 95&#x0025; CI: 0.60-1.11). Similarly, there was no difference between statin users and non-users for the individual components of all-cause death, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and cardiovascular adverse outcome (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In the subgroup analyses, there existed a significant effect modification by hypertension status (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0087). Statin users who had hypertension experienced lower odds for the composite (IPTW OR 0.40, 95&#x0025; CI: 0.23 &#x2013; 0.69). There was no effect modification by age, sex, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="21261329v2_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The results from the sensitivity analyses remained generally consistent with the main analysis with no harmful association between statin use and the outcomes. When redefining the study population, changing the exposure ascertainment window and applying other statistical methods, the primary outcome, all-cause death, ICU admission and cardiovascular outcomes showed generally similar results. Statins showed a protective association with the primary outcome, when using SMR weighting (OR 0.64, 95&#x0025; CI: 0.45 &#x2013; 0.93) and PS matching (OR 0.74, 95&#x0025; CI: 0.56 &#x2013; 0.98). For all-cause deaths, statins showed protective association when using SMR weighting (OR 0.56, 95&#x0025; CI: 0.35 &#x2013; 0.89) and PS matching (OR 0.67, 95&#x0025; CI: 0.46 &#x2013; 0.98). As well, statins showed a protective association for all-cause death, when including all confirmed patients with COVID-19 (OR 0.81, 95&#x0025; CI: 0.68 &#x2013; 0.96). For ICU admission, statin showed protective association when using IPTW weighting with trimming (IPTW OR 0.67, 95&#x0025; CI: 0.47 &#x2013; 0.97), or redefining exposure window to 360 days (IPTW OR 0.67, 95&#x0025; CI: 0.47 &#x2013; 0.97) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s8c">Supplementary Material 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s8g">7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reported on one of the largest investigations of COVID-19 patients with hospitalization in South Korea. It utilized a nationwide and completely enumerated dataset, and applied a propensity score-based weighting to control for potential confounding variables. In the main analysis, there was no significant difference between baseline (pre-hospitalization) statin use vs non-use, with respect to the outcomes of mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation use and cardiovascular outcomes.</p>
<p>Even though our main analysis results showed null association between statin and all cause death, our sensitivity analysis of all cause death showed protective association with statin when using SMR weighting, PS matching or when including all confirmed patients with COVID-19. This finding is similar to report by Lee <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, which showed a protective association of statins for all cause death in the similar cohort while using PS matching with a several different methodological choices from our study (first, they included patients of all age, rather than restricting their analyses to patients who were 40 years old and older; second, statin exposure was defined by Lee <italic>et al</italic> as a prescription up to 90 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis rather than 240 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis; third, they used Cox survival analysis while we used logistic regression). It therefore is possible that we missed detecting real protective association of statin in the main analysis, especially since some of sensitivity analysis showed protective association of statin for primary outcome, all cause death and ICU admission based on varying statistical methods, changing the exposure window change to 360 days and inclusion of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Also, in the prespecified subgroup analysis, statin was found to be associated with lower odds of the primary endpoint in hypertensive patients. As hypertensive COVID-19 patients are known to have poorer prognosis than normotensive patients<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, this result is encouraging; statins may have a greater protective effect, for this sicker cohort of patients with hypertension. Further investigation is needed since statins may be cost-effective, with the potential benefit outweighing any potential toxicities<sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Mechanistically, statins is postulated to upregulate ACE2, countering the effect of SARS-CoV-2 where ACE2 is downregulated and thereby facilitates the infiltration of SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Although statin can cause muscle and liver side effects, discontinuation of statins treatment is known reverse these side effects, alleviating concerns of significant and irreversible adverse effects.</p>
<p>This study has several strengths. First, we used a nationwide cohort of all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in South Korea between January 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020. Since South Korea maintained a strict patient management system during this period, the use of this population-based cohort may mitigate any potential sampling bias issue. In addition, relative to the study by Lee <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, our study design aimed to further mitigate healthy user bias, by including chronic co-medications as confounders, which may have adjusted for past adherence<sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our main findings of no harmful association between statin and COVID-19 outcomes were supported by our sensitivity analyses which showed even protective association when we redefined study population, extended the ascertainment period of the statin use, and considered various statistical approaches. Given these neutral to protective association between statin and COVID-19 outcomes, our findings may support the current guideline which is to continue statin in COVID-19 patients, who have previously been treated with statins<sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There are also several limitations of this study. First, there may have been outcome misclassification in cardiovascular outcome (MI, stroke, and TIA), because we defined our cardiovascular outcome variables by diagnostic codes in admirative claim data. HIRA reported that 82&#x0025; of primary diagnosis codes in claims coincide with electronic medical records,<sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> so more than 18&#x0025; of outcome misclassification can occur while trying to capture all the diagnostic codes other than primary diagnosis codes. However, we expect a greater validity for MI, stroke, and TIA since our study population focused on hospitalized patients under careful management. Other outcomes such as all-cause death seem to be well classified because the HIRA COVID-19 database was linked to the national death records and outcomes defined from procedure codes (ICU admission and mechanical ventilation use) are also expected to be valid since the codes are mandatory in the reimbursement review process. Second, statin exposure was defined based on inpatient and outpatient prescription. We are not aware of detailed information on the exposure, for example, adherence to the prescription. Last, although we performed IPTW and thorough sensitivity analyses, due to the inherent limitation of claims data, there might be still a residual confounding by potential unmeasured confounders typically used in clinical studies (e.g., body mass index, baseline blood pressures, laboratory test values).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our analysis of a nationwide sample of South Korean, hospitalized, COVID-19 patients found that statin users overall did not experience poorer COVID-19 outcomes, relative to non-users. However, in hypertensive patients, a protective association between statin use and COVID-19 outcomes were shown, which calls for further investigation. Given that statins are relatively cheap and not detrimental in this setting, we would encourage further investigation into statin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.</p>
