<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The global COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of numerous digital technologies in medicine from telemedicine to remote monitoring. Concurrently, the pandemic has resulted in huge pressures on healthcare systems. Medical imaging from chest radiographs to computed tomography and ultrasound of the thorax have played an important role in the diagnosis and management of the coronavirus infection.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We undertook a systematic review of the literature focused on MI in COVID-19 and the utility of AI. Keyword searches were performed on PubMed and preprint servers including arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv; 338 papers were included in a meta-analysis and manually reviewed to assess solutions in AI according to their clinical relevance. The maturity of the papers was evaluated based on four criteria: peer-review, patient dataset size, algorithmic complexity and usage of the AI in clinical practice.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>In the first three quarters of 2020, we identified 3444 papers on MI in COVID-19, of which 556 had at least some focus on AI. 2039 of 3444 were specific to imaging modalities and predominantly (80.7&#x0025;) focused on CT (9.9&#x0025; on LUS and 9.5&#x0025; on CXR). The AI literature was predominantly focused on CXR (51.2&#x0025;), 36.1&#x0025; on CT and 1.8&#x0025; on LUS. Only a small portion of the papers were judged as mature (3.8&#x0025;) and most AI papers focused on disease detection (72.8&#x0025;).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This review evidences a disparity between clinicians and the AI community, both in the focus on imaging modalities and performed tasks. Better collaboration is needed to allocate resources optimally for the development of clinically relevant solutions that are validated on large-scale patient data.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Clinical implications</title>
<p>AI may aid clinicians and radiologists by providing better tools for localization and quantification of disease features and changes thereof, and, with integration of clinical data, may provide better diagnostic performance and prognostic value.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created a desperate need for fast, ubiquitous, accurate, and low-cost tests, and lung imaging is a key complementary tool in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. According to the ACR and the Fleischner Society Consensus Statement, imaging of COVID-19 is indicated in case of worsening respiratory symptoms, and, in a resource-constrained environment, for triage of patients with moderate-to-severe clinical features and a high probability of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. This involves two main tasks. The first is diagnosis, including incidental diagnosis and providing supporting evidence in clinical situations in which a false negative RT-PCR test is suspected. The second task is to help evaluate treatment outcomes, disease progression and anticipated prognosis. The field of AI in MI is flourishing in the context of COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and hopes are high that AI can support clinicians and radiologists on these tasks. In this paper, we review the current progress in the development of AI technologies for MI to assist in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, discuss how AI meets the identified gaps and share observations regarding the maturity and clinical relevancy of these developments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>To discover trends from the overwhelming research activities in COVID-19, AI and MI, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the PRISMA guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Literature, indexed in PubMed and three preprint servers, namely, arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv, were queried. The process is illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and shows two main streams of queries; a broad one using &#x201C;AI&#x201D; AND &#x201C;COVID-19&#x201D; AND &#x201C;Medical Imaging&#x201D; and a modality-specific one with &#x201C;AI&#x201D; AND &#x201C;COVID-19&#x201D; AND &#x201C;Lung&#x201D; AND (&#x201C;CT&#x201D; OR &#x201C;CXR&#x201D; OR &#x201C;US&#x201D;). Following PRISMA guidelines, combining the results of both queries across all databases led to the identification of 338 papers about AI on lung imaging for COVID-19. These papers were included in a manual meta-analysis to review the maturity of the AI technologies and the trends in the rapidly evolving field (for the detailed procedure and a list of synonyms used see appendix Table A1). Publications of AI technology typically tend to report a proof of concept, an illustration of a success in a non-clinical setting, or a report of clinically successful experiments. Many of the papers identified are not published in peer reviewed journals. To further evaluate the maturity of papers, we included the size of patient data used for training and evaluation, the deployment and adoption of solutions in hospitals, and the complexity of the AI framework. We also distinguished the type of data used between internally collected and publicly available databases. Moreover, we manually selected the most AI-related common tasks addressed in the papers, such as detection, segmentation, characterization and outcome prediction, and mapped them into three main clinically relevant categories: diagnosis, severity assessement and prognosis, and one technical task: segmentation. The task segmentation describes papers that focused on mere localization of lung tissue or other disease features without the application of any directly clincially relevant downstream tasks.</p>

<caption><title>PRISMA flowchart illustrating the study selection used in the systematic review and meta-analysis.</title>
<p>Publication keyword searches on PubMed, arXiv, biorXiv and medRxiv for Q1-Q3 of 2020 were performed using two parallel streams. After duplicate matches were removed, titles were screened manually and a selection of 338 relevant manuscripts were chosen for manual review.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="20187096v2_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>For publications that focused on several categories, the major task was chosen. For example, a number of publications classified as &#x201C;diagnosis&#x201D; or &#x201C;severity assessment&#x201D; utilized segmentation methods on the fly. Papers that provided a review of existing technologies and did not introduce original new technoglogy were labeled as &#x201C;review&#x201D;. The remaining evaluation criteria per publication were imaging modality, country of authors and country of data source. For each paper, we also recorded the total number of citations indicated on Google Scholar as of 8.11.2020 and converted it to the monthly citation rate. The meta-analysis was blindfolded to the number of citations.</p>

<title>Progress in AI for Medical Imaging</title>
<p>In recent years, AI solutions have shown to be capable of assisting radiologists and clinicians in detecting disease, assessing severity, automatically localizing and quantifying disease features or providing an automated assessment of disease prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. AI for MI has received extraordinary attention in 2020 and witnessed a multitude of interdisciplinary projects attempting to blend AI technologies with knowledge from MI in order to combat COVID-19. A keyword search combining AI and MI revealed 2563 papers in 2019, while the first three quarters of 2020 have seen already 3597 such papers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Out of these publications, 556 are related to COVID-19, indicating that COVID-19 has accelerated the development of AI in MI.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="20187096v2_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A pioneer in the progress of AI for MI is the tremendous success in using AI for detection of breast cancer in screening mammography, a success reported by multiple research groups and achieved after 10 years of effort. These achievements were enabled by large-scale data collections coming from diverse countries such as US, UK, Sweden, South Korea and Israel, see e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> and references therein. Similarly, before the oubreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, significant progress has been made in diagnosing lung conditions using CXR and CT, driven by access to open source datasets and labels. An example is the cutting edge result of the DL-based approach that outperforms radiologists in detecting several pulmonary conditions on CX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Recently, technologies aiming to assist radiologists in such tasks have been made available in the market<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Publication Keyword Search</title>
<p>To enable a perspective on the emergence of AI for MI of COVID-19, we have compiled a comparison on the progress of automatic analysis in breast and lung imaging, in the literature defined above, from January 1<sup>st</sup> 2017 to Septemeber 30<sup>th</sup> 2020. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(left) shows a stable growth of papers in AI on both lung and breast imaging over the years 2017-2019. In 2020, the rise of lung-related papers has been accelerated by COVID-19, causing an additional &#x223C;200 papers (111&#x0025; growth rate) only in the first half of 2020.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="20187096v2_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Preprint vs peer-reviewed papers</title>
<p>To compare the impact of individual modalities, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(right) shows that 2019 witnessed a stable trend of &#x223C;100 papers per quarter on AI with shares of 72&#x0025; for CT, 25&#x0025; for CXR and 2&#x0025; for LUS. After the COVID-19 outbreak, numbers soared to 138, 340 and 365 papers for Q1-Q3 2020 respectively. This rise was spontaneously evoked by COVID-19, as excluding papers mentioning COVID-19 would have resulted in a continuation of the stable trend (see lightly shaded bars) of a hypothetical 100-150 publications. Indicating a shift in the focus of research, the first three quarters of 2020 produced more papers for each modality than all of 2019. Note that, for non-COVID-19 papers, the ratio between preprints and PubMed indexed papers for AI in breast and chest is 30&#x0025; and 46&#x0025;, respectively; for COVID-19 related papers, this ratio rises to 73&#x0025;.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>Meta-analysis</title>
<p>By focusing on CT, CXR and US, we quantified the publication efforts of AI for MI of COVID-19 and identified 338 papers which were included in a manual meta-analysis to review the maturity of the AI technologies and the trends in the rapidly evolving field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3e">
<title>Disparity between Clinical and AI Communities</title>
<p>Of the 3444 papers about MI and COVID-19 (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>(right)), 2039 are specific to modalities as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(left), indicating a dominance of CT in clinical papers (80.7&#x0025;) and a roughly even proportion of LUS (9.9&#x0025;) and CXR imaging (9.5&#x0025;). By using publication counts as an indirect indicator on scientific response, we observe a mismatch in the focus of the AI community in comparison to the clinical community as illustrated by the distribution of papers per modality in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(right) that shows a clear dominance of CXR (51&#x0025;) across AI papers.</p>
<fig id="fig4" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Fig. 4:</label>
<caption><title>Imaging modality comparison during the COVID-19 pandemic.</title>
<p>CT takes the lion&#x2019;s share of clinical papers about lung imaging of COVID-19 (left). The AI community (right) instead published disproportionally more papers on CXR compared to clinicians, whereas CT and Ultrasound are vastly underrepresented. Multimodal papers used more than one imaging modality.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="20187096v2_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In addition, the vast majority (73&#x0025;) of papers focused on diagnosis of COVID-19 over tasks like severity and prognosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(left)). This trend is in contrast to the ACR guidelines appraising imaging as an inconclusive test for COVID-19 detection. Note that a key concern was the unanimous use of only one imaging modality data for training the algorithms (51&#x0025; CXR, see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(right)). While 11&#x0025; of papers exploited multimodal imaging data towards building their AI models, studies on multimodal imaging data of the same patient cohort are lacking with one exception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Most AI Solutions for COVID-19 have Low Maturity</title>
<p>The maturity of the papers was assessed by co-authors who have developed or worked with DL algorithms (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(middle)). Only 13 highly mature studies were identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The list of papers and their task and modality appear in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For details on the task and maturity as distributed by modality see appendix (Fig. A1). Posteriori, we found that the monthly citation rate was significantly higher for high than for low maturity papers (4.1 vs. 2.2, <italic>p</italic>&#x003C;0.05, U), while the correlation was insignificant (r=0.08) across all three maturity levels. However, the correlation of monthly citation rate was highly correlated (r=0.32, p&#x003C;1e-9) with months elapsed since publication. This suggests that absolute citations and relative citation rates are insufficient quality measures and we instead observe a tendency toward continuous citation of publications that appeared early in the pandemic.</p>

<title>Overuse of Small Incomprehensive Public Datasets</title>
<p>We observed that only 28&#x0025; of papers used proprietary or clinical data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(right)), while almost 67&#x0025; analysed publicly available databases. Such databases exist for CT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, CXR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and LUS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and are usually assembled by AI researchers, contain data fetched from publications and are comprised of no more than a few hundred images from heterogenous sources/devices without detailed patient information. Accordingly, the geographical diversity of data sources was not very high (23 countries), and data donators were mostly countries hit early from the pandemic, i.e. China (51&#x0025;) and, to a lesser extent, USA (13&#x0025;) and Italy (12&#x0025;). First-authors from 44 countries and 6 continents contributed to the research, evidencing a global collaborative spirit.</p>

<sec id="s3h">
<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>73&#x0025; of the papers focused on COVID-19 detection and 8 out of the 13 mature papers (62&#x0025;) are addressing this task. However, the most prominent COVID-19 test relies on the identification of viral RNA using RT-PCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Serological tests identifying antibodies are also used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, but as antibody development can take up to 5 days in humans, they are inappropriate for detection of early infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Compared to diagnostic tests, CT imaging may be more sensitive at a single time point for the diagnosis of COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The first main diagnostic challenge is the non-specificity of COVID-19 patterns and their differentiation from non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Here, non-imaging assessments like anamnesis (e.g. contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient or more specific symptoms such as olfactory loss) could contribute to the diagnosis. Secondly, asymptomatic patients with unaffected lungs are notoriously challenging to be detected. In both cases, however the lack of visibly distinguishing features for COVID-19 might not imply a limited ability of DL-based approaches, which might still be able to automatically identify (segment) distinguishing features as part of training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. If DL approaches combine CT and clinical features, the performance of radiologists in the detection of symptomatic COVID-19 patients can be matched, and, crucially, asymptomatic patients with normal CT scans were demonstrated to be identified in 68&#x0025; of the cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In another study, AI recovered full-dose CT from ultra-low-dose CTs with a satisfying acceptance score of 4.4 out of 5 by radiologists (compared to 4.7 and 2.8 for full- and ultra-low-dose respectively) and thus helped to reduce the CT radiation dose by up to 89&#x0025; while still facilitating downstream diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The only highly mature diagnostic study using CXR included almost 6000 scans from &#x003E;2000 COVID-19 patients and their DL model exceeded the diagnostic performance of thoracic radiologists as found by significantly higher area under the curve of 0.94 (vs. 0.85) and sensitivities when matching specificity to radiologists&#x2019; performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s3i">
<title>Severity Assessment</title>
<p>Early in the pandemic, chest CT was used to identify radiological manifestations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Indeed, imaging findings of COVID-19 patients have been shown to correlate with disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and CT scanning accurately assessed the severity of COVID-19 and helped monitor disease transformation among different clinical conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. A retrospective comparison of imaging findings on chest CTs with disease severity revealed an increased occurrence of consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern and bronchial wall thickening in severe patients at a higher frequency than in non-severe COVID-19 patients. The CT findings correlated with several worse symptoms, including a respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93&#x0025; or less in a resting state among other phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In clinical practice, often progress assessments as well as patient management is performed based on CXR and not chest CT. AI that provides assessment of severity could be useful if it was quantifiable and accurate and 4 publications were found mature in performing this task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. One of them utilized a dataset of multiple CT scans per patients and introduced a &#x201C;CT scan simulator&#x201D; that modelled the temporal evolution of the CT through disease progression and was evaluated on multi-national and multi-machine data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The work moreover proposed to decompose the task of CT segmentation from one 3D into three 2D problems, thus achieving remarkable performance. Others developed a clinically useful AI tool for quantification of pulmonary opacity within 10 days and achieved human-level performance when training on less than 200 CT scans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Notably, despite the overall overhead of CXR compared to CT in the analysed publications, only 4 publications in the meta-analysis focused on severity assessment based on CXR (20 on CT, 1 on LUS). One of them was found mature &#x2013; and trained DL models on lung segmentation and opacity detection of 48 COVID-19 patients and achieved an agreement measure (Cohen&#x2019;s kappa) of 0.51 for alveolar opacities and 0.71 for interstitial opacities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In the only identified publication with multimodal imaging data for one patient cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, manual airspace disease segmentation of CTs in 86 COVID-19 patients was used as ground truth to train an AI on volumetric quantification from CXR. The obtained correlation percentage of opacity (PO) volume (CT) and PO area (CXR) was &#x223C;0.8 for both AI and averaged human experts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3j">
<title>Prognosis</title>
<p>Very few of the papers (15, i.e. 4&#x0025;) focused on AI of lung MI to assess prognosis of COVID-19. This reflects the overall gap in knowledge of the long-term effects of COVID-19 and the lack of historical data to enable training on large scale prognosis data. Moreover, in the past few months the hyper-inflammatory response induced by COVID-19 has been identified as a major cause of disease severity and death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Studies have focused in the identification of predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation. Lung imaging is not expected to reflect these biomarkers&#x2019; expression, leading to limited prognosis accuracy based on imaging. One study we found highly mature seamlessly integrated a diagnostic module (based on a CT lung-lesion segmentation) with a prognostic module that combined clinical metadata and quantification of lung-lesion features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The system demonstrated performance comparable to a senior radiologist (sensitivity 93&#x0025;, specificity 90&#x0025;), aided junior radiologists to improve their performance to the senior level and was developed on a multi-center database with 3,777 patients. The prognostic module predicted progression to critical illness and could evaluate drug treatment efficacy by three drugs. Notably, the entire dataset as well as the source code is available to the public to support the development of a better system and to validate their study.</p>

<sec id="s3k">
<title>Segmentation</title>
<p>The main abnormalities observed in common and severe COVID-19 cases respectively were ground glass opacities (GGOs) and patchy consolidation surrounded by GGOs. COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral GGOs that progress to or co-exist with consolidations within 1&#x2013;3 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The visual features of GGOs and consolidation lend themselves to image analysis by DL networks, and with 27 publications (8&#x0025;) segmentation was the second-most performed task after diagnosis. In our analysis none of the mature papers focused on providing a pure segmentation on lung images, but rather used segmentation to enable other clinical tasks, such as diagnosis, as discussed above. In most cases (81&#x0025;) segmentation publications utilized external data sources with little or no clinical collaboration. Some segmentation-based models output pixelwise-labelled tissue maps of GGO or consolidation regions, providing quantitative localization of findings and identification of disease features, which can be especially informative in clinical tasks such as grading disease severity or tracking progression over time. This can be achieved by segmenting anatomical landmarks with reinforcement learning and computing percentage of opacity and lung severity score as complementary severity measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In an exhaustive empirical evaluation of DL models on a clinical dataset of almost 100 COVID-19 patients, distinguishing lesion types was found more difficult than lung segmentation or binary lesion segmentation and model ensembles were found best performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. The manual delineation of radiologists necessary for segmentation tasks inherently introduces some inter-rater variability which necessitates segmentation techniques that can deal with uncertainty in annotations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Others have proposed topological modelling techniques that explore structural relationships between vessels, airways and the pleural wall and break up with the common strategy of utilizing fully local modules such as convolutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An ideal imaging modality should be safe, ubiquitous, accurate, fast, and preferably provide high-quality reproducible results via portable devices. The three different imaging modalities addressed in here differ in their clinical use, their availability, portability, safety and reproducibility. CT is restricted to modern medical facilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. CXR is notoriously less sensitive than CT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, yet, it is the most abundantly used modality across the globe when managing COVID-19 patients. The practical advantages of LUS include non-invasiveness and portability and its consequent role in triage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. However, LUS is operator dependent and requires close patient contact for a relatively longer time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. It was described as a preferred modality in Italy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> during spring 2020, but it is not used as extensively in other geographies, mainly applied for patients with CT/CXR contraindications (children, pregnant women) and predestined to study solid organs unlike the lung. Some reported higher sensitivity than CXR in COVID-19 diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, or even comparable diagnostic accuracy to CT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, but the role of LUS for the COVID-19 pandemic is still actively debated in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. A summary of the differences between the imaging modalities is provided in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The number of papers on AI in MI for COVID-19 have grown exponentially in the past three quarters, and the quality of the manuscripts varies significantly. The AI literature has focused mostly on CXR and CT, similar to prevalence in clinical practice, whereas LUS has received little attention from AI researchers. AI literature focus mainly on diagnosis with less coverage on other tasks with higher clinical relevance, such as severity assessment and monitoring. With few exceptions, the authors of the best publications did not release their clinical datasets, raising concerns about reproducibility and transparency of their studies as was recently exemplified for <italic>Nature</italic> study on breast cancer screening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> and a COVID-19 mortality prediction study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> that was found irreproducible by three independent research groups from different countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Given the global, unprecedented public health challenge caused by COVID-19, we strongly encourage medical researchers to follow the trends toward open-source development in other fields and expedite a transformation toward a common practice of publishing data and code. We hope that a better collaboration between the AI community and medical experts leads to more mature and conducive technologies that will assist clinicians and radiologists in addressing pressing clinical decision support needs.</p>
