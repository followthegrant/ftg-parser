<abstract>
<p>Anti-PD-1 immunotherapies have transformed cancer treatment, yet the determinants of clinical response are largely unknown. We performed CODEX multiplexed tissue imaging and RNA sequencing on 70 tumor regions from 14 advanced cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) patients enrolled in a clinical trial of pembrolizumab therapy. Clinical response was not associated with the frequency of tumor-infiltrating T cell subsets, but rather with striking differences in the spatial organization and functional immune state of the tumor microenvironment (TME). After treatment, pembrolizumab responders had a localized enrichment of tumor and CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, which coincided with immune activation and cytotoxic PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells. In contrast, non-responders had a localized enrichment of Tregs pre- and post-treatment, consistent with a persistently immunosuppressed TME and exhausted PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells. Integrating these findings by computing the physical distances between PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, tumor cells, and Tregs revealed a spatial biomarker predictive of pembrolizumab response. Finally, the chemokine CXCL13 was upregulated in tumor cells in responders post-treatment, suggesting that chemoattraction of PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells towards tumor cells facilitates a positive outcome. Together, these data show that T cell topography reflects the balance of effector and suppressive activity within the TME and predicts clinical response to PD-1 blockade in CTCL.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a rare, heterogeneous group of T cell malignancies that primarily occur in the skin. The majority of CTCLs are comprised of mycosis fungoides and S&#x00E9;zary syndrome, which originate from mature, skin-tropic CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. A third of patients present with advanced-stage disease and those meeting high risk criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 28&#x0025;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. With the exception of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, there are no curative therapies for advanced CTCL, and current treatments typically induce short-lived, partial disease control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as antibodies against PD-1, restore T cell effector function at the tumor site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and promote robust and durable responses in a number of advanced cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In CTCL, PD-1 and its ligands can be simultaneously expressed on tumor cells, making this pathway an attractive therapeutic target for PD-1 blockade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN) multicenter phase II clinical trial of the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced relapsed/refractory CTCL was recently reported (NCT02243579)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In this study, 38&#x0025; of patients achieved a sustained clinical response, whereas 25&#x0025; experienced rapid disease progression, likely because inhibition of PD-1 on tumor cells promoted cancer growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Such outcome discrepancies underscore a need for predictive biomarkers of PD-1 blockade that will allow patients to be stratified into probable responders and non-responders prior to initiating therapy.</p>
<p>To date, biomarker studies with immunohistochemistry (IHC), gene expression profiling, and mass cytometry (CyTOF), have not yet provided predictive indices of pembrolizumab responsiveness in CTCL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Similarly, predictive biomarkers remain in-demand for other tumor types and immunotherapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. As the immune system acts via coordinated cell-cell association, it is expected that spatial cellular attributes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) would be predictive of clinical outcomes. As such, organized cellular contexts would be productive whereas incorrectly arranged cellular contexts (i.e., absence or misplacement of certain cell-types) would prognosticate a negative outcome. Indeed, recent studies indicate that immune cells are not randomly distributed within the TME, but are purposefully organized into cellular neighborhoods and niches that facilitate anti- or pro-tumor functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This raises the question of how PD-1 blockade alters spatial cellular context, and in turn, how such changes in architecture relate to patient responses in CTCL.</p>
<p>We combined CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) multiplexed tissue imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> with gene expression profiling by RNA-seq to interrogate tumors from 14 patients with advanced CTCL sampled before and after pembrolizumab treatment. Then we computationally correlated spatial protein information at the single cell level with matched global gene expression data to generate insights into the drivers and resistors of PD-1 blockade. Our data revealed a localized enrichment of effector CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in responders versus inhibitory Tregs in non-responders. Such topographical differences coincided with variations in the functional immune state of the TME, T cell function, and tumor cell-specific chemokine expression. We integrated these findings into a single <italic>SpatialScore</italic>&#x2014;a spatial biomarker predictive of pembrolizumab outcome&#x2014;that can be accurately recapitulated using clinically accessible multiplexed IHC (mIHC) platforms. The results underscore a key determinant of spatial cellular organization, namely a distancing balance of effector and suppressive T cell activity, for predicting anti-PD-1 immunotherapy response in CTCL.</p>

<p>Therapeutic response to pembrolizumab was assessed by consensus global response criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. No significant differences were observed at baseline between responders and non-responders for patient demographics, cancer type/stage, and treatment history (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). Clinical outcomes were significantly different between patient groups (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). Responders had a significant improvement in their overall skin response compared to non-responders, as measured by the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Sup.

The expression of key T cell, macrophage and PD-1 signaling markers was assessed by standard IHC for each patient&#x2019;s pre-treatment tumor biopsy: PD-L2 expression was slightly increased in non-responders compared to responders but did not reach statistical significance (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>).

Comparing the fluorescent stainings of reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (blue crosses) and malignant CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (red crosses) showed that in tumor cells CD7 was decreased and CD25 and Ki-67 were increased (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref></bold>), consistent with an advanced CTCL phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Quantifying these expression differences for tumor cells relative to reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells showed a fold-change of 0.40 for CD7, 1.87 for CD25, and 3.47 for Ki-67 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref></bold>, <italic>p</italic>&#x003C;0.0001). Tumor cells were also larger in size than reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref></bold>), in line with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. One patient had large cell transformation, but the average size of tumor cells in that patient was not significantly different from the other 13 patients. Additionally, we identified genes predictive of the frequency of tumor cells per tissue microarray spot by fitting an L1-regularized linear model to bulk RNA-seq data. This confirmed that higher expression of several known CTCL marker genes, including <italic>CD27, IL-32, CXCL13, BATF</italic>, and <italic>TIGIT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, was associated with spots with higher frequencies of tumor cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref></bold>, see yellow highlighted gene names). Notably, CTCL tumor cells can also express FoxP3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, as was the case for one patient in this clinical trial cohort. Our clustering approach identified this population of malignant FoxP3<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, which differed significantly from Tregs, with lower CD3, CD4, and FoxP3 marker expression and larger cell size (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 1e</xref></bold>). Given the heterogeneity of CTCL, the marker expression profile of tumor cells may differ between cohorts, especially those that were heavily pre-treated. However, these findings demonstrate that multiplexed imaging can discriminate malignant from reactive CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells at the single-cell level, which is supported by cell size measurements and gene expression profiling.</p>

<title>Deep profiling of the CTCL TME in response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy</title>
<p>Anti-PD-1 immunotherapies are premised on the ability to alter the delicate balance of positive and negative immune signaling to promote the recognition and elimination of tumor cells. Tumor cells, however, shift this balance in favor of their own survival and proliferation. We reasoned that delineating the complexities of tumor and immune cell interactions within the TME may reveal the cell specific organizations that determine pembrolizumab response and resistance in CTCL.</p>
<p>We first explored how cellular composition contributes to the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in CTCL by cataloging the frequencies of the 21 cell-types identified by CODEX across patient groups. The 21 cell-types included 13 immune cell-types, 6 auxiliary cell-types, and 2 tumor cell-types (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 2b</xref></bold>). Markers for T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, FoxP3), macrophages (CD68), dendritic cells (CD11c), tumor cells (CD4), vasculature (CD31), and epithelium (cytokeratin) were clearly visualized in the CODEX fluorescent images (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-b</xref>, upper panels; <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Sup.

<p>Interestingly, no differences in the content of the 21 identified cell-types were noted between responders and non-responders pre- or post-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c-d</xref>; <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 2c</xref></bold>). The combined frequencies of tumor, immune and auxiliary cell-types each comprised approximately one-third of all cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, upper panel</bold>); the same trend held across patient groups (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 2c</xref></bold>). Tumor cell content (averaged across all TMA spots in a patient group) was unchanged in responders or non-responders following pembrolizumab therapy (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 2c</xref></bold>), likely because only heavily infiltrated skin tumor biopsy regions were used for this study. Among all immune cells, the ranked cell-type frequencies were 38&#x0025; for M<sub>1</sub> macrophages, 21&#x0025; for Tregs, 15&#x0025; for CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, 5&#x0025; for M2 macrophages, 5&#x0025; for CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, and &#x003C;5&#x0025; for other immune cell-types including B cells, plasma cells, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, mast cells, and neutrophils (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, lower panel</bold>). No differences in the mean frequencies of immune cell-types were observed when comparing responders and non-responders pre- and post-treatment; this is highlighted for T cells (CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T, CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T, Tregs) and macrophages (M1 and M2) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). This finding is consistent with the initial publication on this CTCL cohort and our baseline IHC data (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c-d</xref></bold>), which showed no correlation between pembrolizumab response and the expression of T cell, macrophage or PD-1 signaling markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, it contrasts with some solid tumor studies, which have correlated the density of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes with clinical outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and immunotherapy response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We next focused on differences in immune signaling between responders and non-responders. Immunogenomic analyses were preformed to characterize the functional immune state of the TME, which has been shown to be a key determinant of immunotherapeutic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Gene expression signatures that have predicted PD-1/PD-L1 blockade response (e.g., IFN-&#x03B3; scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3a">Sup. Table 3</xref></bold>) and non-response (e.g., TGF-&#x03B2; scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3a">Sup. Table 3</xref></bold>) in solid tumors were applied to our CTCL data. No differences were observed pre-treatment in responders versus non-responders for the IFN-&#x03B3; (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref></bold>, median R, pre (0.77) versus NR, pre (0.76)) or TGF-&#x03B2; (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref></bold>, median R, pre (0.28) versus NR, pre (&#x2212;0.32)) gene scores; hence, neither signature was predictive of pembrolizumab response in CTCL. Since these predictive gene signatures were derived from single-disease studies, their utilization may be limited to similar solid tumor types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Rare cancers like CTCL do not have specifically defined immune gene signatures, making it a challenge to catalogue their tumor immunogenicity. Gene lists of immune activation (e.g., <italic>CD27, EOMES</italic>, and <italic>ICOS</italic>) and immunosuppression (e.g., <italic>ENTPD1, TGFB1</italic>, and <italic>TIGIT</italic>) molecules were therefore compiled (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3a">Sup. Table 3</xref></bold>) and used to assess how the functional immune state of the CTCL TME was altered in response to pembrolizumab. Notably, genes like <italic>PDCD1</italic> and <italic>TNFRSF18</italic>, which can be both immune activating and suppressive depending on cellular state and microenvironmental context, were excluded from this analysis. The immune activation gene score was significantly increased in responders post-treatment compared with pre-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref></bold>, median R, pre (&#x2212;2.54) versus R, post (1.21)), with no significant change in non-responders post-versus pre-treatment. This indicates that only responders develop an immune activated TME phenotype following pembrolizumab therapy. In contrast, the immunosuppression gene scores were significantly increased in non-responders compared to responders both pre- and post-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref></bold>, median NR, pre (0.59) versus R, pre (&#x2212;0.83) and NR, post (0.64) versus R, post (&#x2212;1.12)), implying that non-responders have an immunosuppressed TME phenotype relative to responders. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the functional immune state of the CTCL TME depends on factors beyond raw immune cell counts. Exploring the spatial patterns of immune infiltration is an essential step towards understanding the indicators predictive of immunotherapy outcome.</p>

<title>PD-1 blockade induces spatial re-organization of the CTCL TME</title>
<p>It is expected that the functional immune state of the TME will be mediated by its spatial cellular organization. Cellular neighborhood (CN) analysis, applied previously in a study on colorectal cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, was performed to obtain a high level view of CTCL tissue architecture. CNs are analogous to urban neighborhoods&#x2014;essentially geographically localized areas within a larger city that facilitate social interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). Likewise, CNs are defined by a localized enrichment of specific cell-types within the tissue that mediate cellular interactions and vital tissue functions (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 2e</xref></bold>). Computationally, the CN algorithm extracts quantitative data on the composition and spatial distribution of individual cells to reveal how local cellular niches are organized within tissues (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Specifically, computational parameters like the window size and number of CNs to be computed are manually set (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a.1</xref></bold>). Each cell in the tissue is assigned to a given CN based on the composition of cell-types within the specified window (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a.2</xref></bold>). The windows are then clustered and the correlation of CNs and cell-types are represented as a heatmap (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a.3</xref></bold>). CNs are visualized as Voronoi diagrams and analyzed to better understand cellular spatial behavior (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a.4</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Using a window size of 10 nearest neighbors, we identified 10 distinct CNs that were conserved across this CTCL cohort (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 3c</xref></bold>). Some CNs recapitulated structural components that are clearly discernable in the corresponding H&#x0026;E and fluorescent images, such as epithelium (CN-1, green region) and vasculature (CN-3, brown region) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref></bold>). The other CNs were composed of previously unappreciated sub-structures within the dermal infiltrate that were not apparent in the corresponding H&#x0026;E or fluorescent images, including immune-infiltrated stroma (CN-2, red region), vascularized stroma (CN-4, gray region), tumor and dendritic cells (CN-5, purple region), lymphatic enriched stroma (CN-6, orange region), tumor and mixed immune cells (CN-7, cyan region), tumor and CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (CN-8, yellow region), innate immune cell enriched (CN-9, blue region), and Treg enriched (CN-10, pink region) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref></bold>). Representative Voronoi diagrams from a responder (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref></bold>, see CN-5 and CN-8, purple and yellow regions, respectively) and non-responder (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref></bold>, see CN-10, pink region) post-treatment show significant differences in the frequency of CNs between patient groups. CNs enriched in tumor and dendritic cells (CN-5, purple region) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref></bold>, mean frequency in R, post (21.4&#x0025;) versus R, pre (3.2&#x0025;)) and tumor and CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (CN-8, yellow region) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref></bold>, mean frequency in R, post (19.0&#x0025;) versus R, pre (8.5&#x0025;)) were present at significantly higher levels in responders post-treatment than in non-responders or either group pre-treatment. In contrast, the Treg enriched CN (CN-10, pink region) was present at a significantly higher frequency in non-responders than responders pre- and post-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref></bold>, mean frequency in NR, pre (15.5&#x0025;) versus R, pre (3.3&#x0025;) and NR, post (22.7&#x0025;) versus R, post (4.9&#x0025;)). Notably, these differences in the spatial organization of certain cell-types were observed even though there were no differences in the abundance of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, dendritic cells, Tregs, or tumor cells between patient groups, as previously described (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c-d</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The increased co-localization of dendritic cells, CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and tumor cells in responders post-treatment, relative to other patient groups, suggests that the more immune activated TME observed in responders following pembrolizumab therapy (i.e., increased immune activation gene score in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref></bold>) may in part be mediated by CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell activation by antigen-presenting cells. Indeed, after PD-1 blockade, responders had increased frequencies of activated ICOS<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3i</xref></bold>, mean frequency in R, post (1.9&#x0025;) versus R, pre (0.7&#x0025;) and NR, post (0.2&#x0025;)) and proliferating Ki-67<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref></bold>, mean frequency in R, post (0.8&#x0025;) versus R, pre (0.1&#x0025;) and NR, post (0.1&#x0025;)) compared to responders pre-treatment and non-responders post-treatment, suggesting that pembrolizumab therapy activates CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells through upregulation of immune activating molecules.</p>
<p>The increased frequency of the Treg enriched CN in non-responders pre- and post-treatment is consistent with our finding that non-responders have a persistently immunosuppressed TME (i.e., increased immunosuppression gene score in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref></bold>), which is further supported by the higher frequency of a potently suppressive subset of Tregs expressing ICOS in non-responders (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3k</xref></bold>, mean frequency in NR, pre (4.4&#x0025;) versus R, pre (1.2&#x0025;) and NR, post (6.2&#x0025;) versus R, post (1.2&#x0025;))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Interestingly, despite treatment with PD-1 blockade, no differences were observed in PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> subsets of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, Tregs, or tumor cells between groups (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 2-i</xref></bold>). Collectively, these data link the spatial re-organization of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, tumor cells, and Tregs with immune activity of the TME, highlighting patterns of immune control and pembrolizumab responsiveness.</p>

<title>Spatial signature of PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, tumor cells, and Tregs predicts pembrolizumab response in CTCL</title>
<p>It is reasonable to suspect that specific cellular interactions drive pembrolizumab responsiveness in CTCL. While complex spatial analyses have been used to prognosticate cancer outcomes in select clinical cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that a simplified approach based on the distances between specific immune and tumor cells could be employed. Guided by our CN findings, which highlighted the spatial arrangement of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, tumor cells and Tregs, we formalized a computational scoring approach to standardizing a spatial signature. This score, termed <italic>SpatialScore</italic>, calculates the physical distance ratio of each CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell and its nearest tumor cell (&#x201C;right&#x201D; distance) relative to its nearest Treg (&#x201C;left&#x201D; distance) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>).

<p>The <italic>SpatialScore</italic> is calculated on a per cell basis and the mean value is reported for each patient group. When calculated with all CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, the pre-treatment <italic>SpatialScore</italic> was significantly lower in responders than non-responders, with enhancement post-treatment for both groups (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>, compare mean <italic>SpatialScore</italic> for R, pre (0.57) versus NR, pre (0.63)). The same trend was observed on a per patient basis (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4a</xref></bold>). Since the current study trialed PD-1 blockade in CTCL, we next asked how the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> was influenced by the PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell subset. As observed when calculated with all CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, when computed with PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, tumor cells, and Tregs, the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> was lower in responders than non-responders (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>, compare mean <italic>SpatialScore</italic> for R, pre (0.41) versus NR, pre (0.62)). The same trend was seen on a per patient basis (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4b</xref></bold>). Notably, the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> was lower in responders pre-treatment when calculated with PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells versus all CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, implying increased effector activity in this T cell subset. These results suggest that PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in responders are primed for increased anti-tumor activity, which is enhanced in the immune activated TME that results following pembrolizumab therapy.</p>
<p>Since the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> approach appears to predict the outcome of PD-1 blockade in CTCL, it stands to reason that there is a deep phenotype of cell-type specific architecture that is driving the <italic>SpatialScore</italic>. Pre-treatment differences were driven by the closer proximity of PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and Tregs in non-responders (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4c</xref></bold>, see red arrow), consistent with the increased immunosuppression gene scores in non-responders relative to responders (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref></bold>). In contrast, post-treatment differences were driven by the closer proximity of PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and tumor cells in responders (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4d</xref></bold>, see red arrow), consistent with the increased immune activation gene score in responders relative to non-responders (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref></bold>). Importantly, no correlation was identified between the abundance of PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, tumor cells, or Tregs and the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> on a per tissue microarray spot basis (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4g-i</xref></bold>), implying that the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> is not merely driven by cell-type frequency. Additionally, the mean <italic>SpatialScore</italic> was significantly different from that of a random sample in responders pre- and post-treatment (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">l</xref></bold>), but not in non-responders pre- and post-treatment (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4k</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">m</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>This suggests that an active process coordinates the spatial interactions of PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, tumor cells and Tregs in responders, whereas no such mechanism exists in non-responders. Finally, when the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> was calculated for CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4e</xref></bold>) or PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4f</xref></bold>), it was not predictive of pembrolizumab response. The increased proximity of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and tumor cells observed in pembrolizumab responders&#x2014;and lack thereof for CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells&#x2014;suggests that CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells may have a more important effector function in CTCL than previously appreciated.</p>

<title>PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells upregulate cytotoxic effector molecules in pembrolizumab responders</title>
<p>We reasoned that the spatial proximity of PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and tumor cells reflected the enhanced CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell tumor reactivity seen in responders following pembrolizumab therapy. CODEX and RNA-seq datasets were therefore used to assess the cytotoxic potential of effector PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells. In CTCL, cytotoxic CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells act through a granzyme-perforin-dependent pathway to achieve tumor cell killing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, similar to cytotoxic CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. The expression of granzyme B (GZMB) on PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells was increased in responders post-versus pre-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref></bold>, mean GZMB expression, R, post (26.9) versus NR, post (12.2) and R, pre (12.1)). This increased GZMB expression is confirmed visually in a responder post-treatment with DRAQ5 (nuclear stain), CD4, PD-1, and GZMB fluorescent staining (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref></bold>, see white arrow) and is consistent with the increased cytotoxicity gene score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> seen in responders post-treatment compared to pre-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref></bold>, median R, post (1.21) versus R, pre (&#x2212;1.77), <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3b">Sup.

No differences were observed between non-responders pre- and post-treatment with regards to GZMB expression on PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref></bold>, mean expression, NR, pre (11.7) versus NR, post (12.2)) or the cytotoxicity gene score (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref></bold>, median NR, pre (0.21) versus NR, post (0.43)).</p>
<p>Increased cytotoxicity should coincide with decreased tumor cell aggressiveness and, using genes associated with poor response to therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and progressive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> CTCL (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3c">Sup.

This increased tumor aggressiveness in non-responders was further supported by an increased frequency of proliferating (Ki-67<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) tumor cells in non-responders post-versus pre-treatment and compared to responders post-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref></bold>, mean frequency, NR, post (17.0&#x0025;) versus NR, pre (8.9&#x0025;) and R, post (7.8&#x0025;))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.

<title>Validation of the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> biomarker with a clinically accessible multiplexed IHC platform</title>
<p>While mIHC approaches, such as CODEX, provide the raw data for deep cellular profiling, translating these findings to a clinical arena requires simplifying the predictive signature to a diagnostic platform that can be readily implemented in clinical practice. Vectra, in conjugation with the Phenoptics workflow, is a commercially available, widely adopted clinical mIHC imaging platform, which has been used to identify biomarkers for renal cell carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> and B cell lymphoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. We devised a simplified staining panel (DAPI, CD3, CD4, CD7, CD8, CD25, FoxP3, and PD-1) that captured the PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, tumor cells, and Tregs used to calculate the <italic>SpatialScore</italic>. Notably, the tumor cell phenotype identified by CODEX (i.e., decreased expression of CD7 and increased expression of CD25 and Ki-67; <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref></bold>), was critical for establishing this streamlined staining panel and could be readily transferred to the Vectra platform.</p>
<p>Serial sections from the same CTCL TMA used for CODEX and RNA-seq were stained with this simplified panel and imaged with Vectra (<bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 5a</xref></bold>). Across all TMA spots, 126,653 cells were identified, including 2,957 PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, 6,161 Tregs, and 19,847 tumor cells. The <italic>SpatialScore</italic> was then computed on a per cell basis and the mean was reported for each patient group. Consistent with the CODEX results (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>), the Vectra-calculated <italic>SpatialScore</italic> was significantly lower in responders than non-responders pre-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref></bold>, mean <italic>SpatialScore</italic> R, pre (0.35) versus NR, pre (0.76)), with enhancement post-treatment compared to pre-treatment. The Vectra mIHC images (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k</xref></bold>, left) and corresponding spatial maps (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k</xref></bold>, right) provide visual validation at the single-cell level that PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells were closer to tumor cells in responders but closer to Tregs in non-responders. Furthermore, on a per patient basis, the pre-treatment <italic>SpatialScore</italic> was nearly 5-times lower in responders than non-responders (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4l</xref></bold>, mean <italic>SpatialScore</italic> R, pre (0.31) versus NR, pre (1.52)), with excellent biomarker performance measures at a <italic>SpatialScore</italic> cutoff point of 0.7908 (<bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 5b-e</xref></bold>). Notably, when calculated per patient, the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> extended over a wider range than when calculated for all cells per group; this is due to sample size differences (i.e., n=7 per patient versus n=1000s of cells per group). It is noteworthy that the skin-derived <italic>SpatialScore</italic> is so robust and predictive of pembrolizumab response, since clinical outcome in advanced CTCL is often driven by the burden of disease in the non-skin compartments (i.e., blood or viscera). Collectively, these results show that findings identified by highly multiplexed imaging platforms like CODEX can be translated to more simplified platforms like Vectra, further demonstrating the clinical utility of the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> as a biomarker predictive of PD-1 blockade outcome in CTCL.</p>

<title>Tumor cell-specific CXCL13 expression coincides with a favorable response to PD-1 blockade in CTCL</title>
<p>Potential recruitment mechanisms driving the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> were investigated by identifying genes predictive of the spatial interactions between PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, tumor cells, and Tregs. An L1-regularized linear model was fit to bulk RNA-seq data on a per spot basis, which revealed seven genes predictive of the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> including three chemokines: <italic>CXCL9, CCL22</italic> and <italic>CXCL13</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>). <italic>CXCL9</italic> and <italic>CCL22</italic> are known to mediate Treg recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>; they had positive coefficients and were predictive of the higher <italic>SpatialScore</italic> seen in non-responders. <italic>CXCL13</italic> is a chemoattractant expressed on benign lymphocytes and CTCL tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>; it had a negative coefficient and was predictive of the lower <italic>SpatialScore</italic> seen in responders.

<p>Proposed mechanisms of pembrolizumab response in therapy responders (top panel) and non-responders (bottom panel) pre- and post-treatment. The functional immune status of the TME is represented by blue shading when activated and pink shading when suppressed. In non-responders, the TME is continually immunosuppressed and persistently exhausted PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells are in closer proximity to potently suppressive ICOS<sup>&#x002B;</sup> Tregs. Due to pembrolizumab resistance, non-responder tumor cells become more aggressive following therapy. In contrast, responders have a neutral functional immune state pre-treatment, which becomes activated following pembrolizumab therapy, enabling the transition from exhausted to effector PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells. Additionally, responder tumor cells are susceptible to PD-1 blockade and overexpress CXCL13. This attracts effector PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells toward tumor cells, providing a mechanism for the sustained clinical response seen in responders.</p></caption>

<p>CIBERSORTx (CSx) is a computational framework that uses gene expression signatures to enable cell type-specific gene expression to be inferred from bulk RNA-seq data without physical cell isolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We used CSx to computationally resolve tumor, stromal, and immune cell subsets in bulk RNA-seq data (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS4a">Sup. Table 4</xref></bold>). Using the 10 annotated clusters shown in <bold>Fig. e-f</bold>, a signature matrix, consisting of cell-type specific marker genes, was generated (<bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig 6c</xref></bold> and see <bold>Methods</bold>, marker genes are shown as rows). This signature matrix was used to enumerate CSx-resolved cell-type fractions and resolve gene expression profiles from CTCL bulk transcriptomes. Strong correlations were observed between most of the CSx-resolved cell-type frequencies and CODEX-identified cell-type frequencies (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref></bold>, see correlation coefficients along the diagonal of the heatmap).</p>
<p>The CSx-resolved gene expression profiles of tumor cells were then thoroughly characterized and compared across patient groups. Interestingly, <italic>RAB11B</italic>, a RAS superfamily member of small GTP-binding proteins, was the only tumor cell gene that was significantly differentially expressed between responders and non-responders pre-treatment (<bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 6d</xref></bold>). This suggests an absence of tumor cell-intrinsic differences between responders and non-responders at baseline. In contrast, numerous genes, including <italic>CXCL13</italic>, were upregulated in tumor cells of responders post-treatment compared to pre-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref></bold>, see <italic>CXCL13</italic> in bold). This finding is consistent with an increased susceptibility of responder tumor cells to PD-1 blockade therapy, which is supported by the decreased tumor aggressiveness score observed in responders post-treatment relative to pre-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref></bold>). Interestingly, only three genes (<italic>BRD3, TWF2</italic> and <italic>ZNF365</italic>) were differentially expressed in non-responder tumor cells post-treatment compared to pre-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5j</xref></bold>). This suggests that non-responder tumor cells are resistant to PD-1 blockade, which is in line with the increased tumor aggressiveness score observed in non-responders post-treatment compared to pre-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref></bold>). Finally, co-staining the tissue section used for the Vectra mIHC experiment with a standard IHC anti-CXCL13 antibody, followed by co-localization of tumor cells with CXCL13-positive cells, provided visual confirmation that tumor cells are the primary expressors of CXCL13 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5k</xref>, <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 6e</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Next, we assessed <italic>CXCL13</italic> expression in tumor cells and its role in recruiting reactive lymphocytes. CSx-resolved tumor cell-specific <italic>CXCL13</italic> expression was significantly increased in responders post-treatment compared with non-responders post-treatment and responders pre-treatment on a per tissue microarray spot basis (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5l</xref></bold>, median normalized tumor cell-specific <italic>CXCL13</italic> expression, R, post (12.64) versus NR, post (11.14) and R, pre (10.54)). On a per patient basis, following PD-1 blockade, tumor cell-resolved <italic>CXCL13</italic> expression increased in 100&#x0025; of responders (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5m</xref></bold>) versus 29&#x0025; of non-responders (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5n</xref></bold>). CXCL13 exclusively binds to the chemokine receptor CXCR5, which is expressed on B cells, CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, and skin-derived migratory dendritic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Although not significant, <italic>CXCR5</italic> expression was increased in bulk mRNA of responders post-treatment relative to pre-treatment (<bold><xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 6f</xref></bold>). The data lacked significant power to unmix <italic>CXCR5</italic> on CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells by CSx; however, tumor cell-specific <italic>CXCL13</italic> expression was positively correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.68) with bulk mRNA <italic>CXCR5</italic> expression (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5o</xref></bold>), suggesting a chemoattractant recruitment mechanism.</p>
<p>Collectively, these results indicate that PD-1 blockade distinctly alters the CTCL TME of therapeutic responders and non-responders. In responders, pembrolizumab therapy promotes immune activation and upregulates CXCL13 in tumor cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>, top panel). CXCL13 overexpression then attracts effector/cytotoxic PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells to tumor cells, promoting CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell-mediated tumor cell inhibition and killing. As such, the overexpression of CXCL13 in tumor cells provides a mechanism for the sustained clinical activity seen in responders. In contrast, non-responders have a persistently immunosuppressed TME, which mediates the increased interaction between inhibitory Tregs and PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and maintains this CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell subset in an exhausted state (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>, bottom panel). In the setting of pembrolizumab resistance, non-responder tumor cells remain active and proliferative following treatment. Thus, underlying differences in the functional immune state of the TME&#x2014;coupled with alterations in CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell effector activity versus suppression, and tumor cell-specific CXCL13 expression&#x2014; are associated with distinct spatial cellular patterns that predict the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in CTCL.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>For anti-PD-1 immunotherapies to provide maximal benefit to cancer patients, the drivers and resistors of clinical response must be identified. Traditional biomarker studies with IHC, gene expression profiling, and tumor mutational burden assays do not fully account for spatial cellular context and have imperfect correlation with immunotherapy outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. This was true for our CTCL cohort: No pre-treatment differences were observed in immune composition, expression of PD-1/PD-L1 proteins, or IFN-&#x03B3;/TGF-&#x03B2; gene signatures between responders and non-responders. We therefore explored alternative approaches, including spatially resolved multiplexed tissue imaging, which has been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of predicting response to PD-1 blockade in several tumor types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Multiparameter histologic analysis revealed global prognostic spatial patterns that were predictive of clinical response, including a localized enrichment of tumor and CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (CN-8) in responders and of Tregs (CN-10) in non-responders. Profiling the spatial relationships between effector PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, tumor cells, and immunosuppressive Tregs allowed us to derive the <italic>SpatialScore</italic>&#x2014;a clinically useful biomarker that correlated strongly with pembrolizumab response in CTCL. Previously identified spatial biomarkers rely on pairwise distances (e.g., PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and PD-L1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> tumor cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, whereas the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> accounts for the interactions between three functionally distinct cell-types. As such, the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> represents a novel predictive approach and provides insight into three key therapeutic determinants underlying PD-1 blockade in CTCL: 1) functional immune state of the TME, 2) T cell function, and 3) chemoattraction.</p>
<p>First, the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> captures differences in the functional immune phenotypes between responders and non-responders. Following pembrolizumab therapy, the TME of responders becomes activated, as evidenced by the increased immune activation gene score, increased frequency of ICOS<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and Ki-67<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, and a local enrichment of tumor cells with dendritic cells (CN-5) and CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (CN-8). These findings suggest that in responders PD-1 blockade specifically activates CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells through the expression of immunostimulatory molecules and co-stimulation by antigen-presenting cells, resulting in CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. In contrast, non-responders have a persistently immunosuppressed TME. This is supported by the increased frequency of a Treg enriched neighborhood (CN-10) and the expansion of a highly suppressive ICOS<sup>&#x002B;</sup> Treg subset, which has been associated with poor clinical outcomes in melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> and liver cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. These results suggest that the increased suppressive function and spatial organization of Tregs in non-responders account for the strong immunosuppression and lack of pembrolizumab response. We speculate that the absence of this pre-treatment immunosuppression in responders enables priming and activation of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells following immunotherapy.</p>
<p>Second, the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> reflects differences in T cell function between responders and non-responders: After PD-1 blockade, T cell effector activity is restored in responders, whereas non-responders have a continually exhausted T cell phenotype. Consistent with studies of Hodgkin lymphoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, bladder cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, and glioblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, our data suggest that CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, and particularly the PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell subset, are crucial effectors that influence pembrolizumab efficacy in CTCL. In responders post-treatment, PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells increase GZMB expression and move closer to tumor cells, similar to the granzyme-perforin-dependent tumor killing mechanism used by cytotoxic CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that antitumor activity is enhanced by a closer proximity of cytotoxic T cells to tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> and by removing inhibitory Tregs from the TME milleu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. The <italic>SpatialScore</italic> combines these principles by measuring the physical distances between PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and tumor cells (i.e., effector function) as well as PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and Tregs (i.e., suppressive function). The <italic>SpatialScore</italic> therefore reflects the balance of T cell effector activity versus suppression in the TME and the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in CTCL.</p>
<p>Third, pembrolizumab therapy leads to increased RNA and protein expression of CXCL13 in responder tumor cells (or kills cells with lower levels of expression), which may be advantageous in localizing effector PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells within the TME. Overexpression of <italic>CXCL13</italic> is associated with improved clinical outcomes in breast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, colon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, ovarian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, and urothelial cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> as well as responsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Additionally, upregulation of <italic>CXCL13</italic> can be accompanied by constitutive protein secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, which strongly attracts CXCR5<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> and PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> to the tumor site. A recent study also showed that the tumor-specific gene expression program of cytotoxic GZMB<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in bladder cancer treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy was marked by tumor overexpression of <italic>CXCL13</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Furthermore, CXCL13 null mice with bladder tumors did not respond to anti-PD-1 treatment and had a lower frequency of T cell infiltration compared their wild-type counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Collectively, these findings support a chemoattractant mechanism for the sustained clinical response to pembrolizumab therapy observed in responders: Upregulation of CXCL13 in tumor cells attracts effector PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells to them, promoting successful antitumor activity. This aspect of pembrolizumab responsiveness is captured by the lower <italic>SpatialScore</italic> seen in responders and underscores the importance of T cell topography as a spatial biomarker.</p>
<p>There are important limitations to this study. Discovery of the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> was based on 14 patients. Larger studies are needed to determine if this spatial biomarker translates broadly for prediction of pembrolizumab response in CTCL and to establish a threshold value for the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> that can be used to stratify patients into probabilistic responders and non-responders. Additionally, larger studies might delineate more subtle features of the spatial architecture not detected in this study. Another limitation of this study is that the post-treatment tumor biopsies were collected at various time points, impairing our ability to directly assess modulation of T cell subsets at the precise time of therapeutic success or failure. Finally, our cohort is limited to advanced, heavily pre-treated CTCL patients. Further efforts should examine the therapeutic activity of PD-1 blockade in early stage and treatment na&#x00EF;ve patients, since early tumors are generally more responsive to immunotherapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> and prior systemic treatment may alter the immune response to therapy. Despite these limitations, the robustness of our findings highlights that spatial organization and immune functionality are conserved in responders and non-responders, which reinforces the importance of these factors for determining pembrolizumab response in CTCL.</p>
<p>Future studies with scRNA-seq and paired T cell receptor sequencing are needed to better characterize the heterogeneity of PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells across patient groups and to fully understand the cytotoxic potential of this crucial effector subset. Similarly, investigating the increased suppressive function of Tregs and the ICOS<sup>&#x002B;</sup> Treg subset in non-responders may reveal vulnerabilities that could be targeted in combination with PD-1 blockade. Given our findings that non-responders have an increased localization of Tregs and upregulation of <italic>BRD3</italic>, an epigenetic regulator, in their tumor cells pre-treatment, future studies should investigate the therapeutic potential of combining mogamulizumab (which depletes Tregs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>) and/or bromodomain inhibitors (which inhibit BRD3 and decrease tumor cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>) with pembrolizumab therapy for CTCL. Further studies are also required to determine if CXCL13 expression levels&#x2014;in both skin and blood&#x2014;can serve as a surrogate of pembrolizumab activity and therefore guide ongoing treatment decisions. Such studies are especially important for advanced CTCL patients, where the burden of disease in the non-skin compartments often dictate clinical outcome.</p>
<p>This work provides an important conceptual foundation for improving the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in CTCL. We identify effector PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in responders and inhibitory ICOS<sup>&#x002B;</sup> Tregs in non-responders. The <italic>SpatialScore</italic> captures the interactions of these cell-types with tumor cells and reveals how PD-1 blockade manipulates the balance of effector and suppressive T cell function to achieve disease control. We anticipate that the cell-types comprising the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> will depend on the specific cancer and immunotherapy. The <italic>SpatialScore</italic> biomarker approach and the ability to measure it using a clinically accessible mIHC platform should enable its widespread use in cancer immunotherapy studies.</p>

<title>Human subjects and clinical trial study design</title>
<p>The CITN-10 trial was a multicenter, phase II, single-arm clinical trial that investigated the efficacy of pembrolizumab in 24 patients with two common forms of relapsed/refractory CTCL, mycosis fungoides and S&#x00E9;zary syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Written informed consent was obtained from all enrolled patients. The use of their tissues for research was fully de-personalized and approved by the Stanford University IRB Administrative Panels on Human Subjects in Medical Research (HSR 46894). All patients had a clinicopathologically confirmed diagnosis of mycosis fungoides or S&#x00E9;zary syndrome (clinical stage IB to IV) that had relapsed, was refractory to, or had progressed after at least one standard systemic therapy. Exclusion criteria included central nervous system disease, active autoimmune disease, previous exposure to any anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 therapy, or treatment with radiotherapy or other anti-cancer agents within 15 weeks of the pre-treatment biopsy. Topical medications were not applied to the biopsied areas during treatment or within 8 weeks of the pre-treatment biopsy. Patients were treated with 2 mg/kg pembrolizumab by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to 24 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Response and primary end point (overall response rate) were assessed by consensus global response criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s6b">
<title>Sample collection and tissue microarray construction</title>
<p>Skin biopsy specimens were collected from the primary tumor site and FFPE histology blocks were generated according to standard pathology procedures. Pre-treatment biopsies were obtained prior to the first pembrolizumab infusion and post-treatment biopsies were collected during and at the conclusion of therapy (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1a">Sup. Table 1</xref></bold>). H&#x0026;E-stained sections from all biopsies were reviewed by two board-certified pathologists (C.M.S. and R.H.P.). Fourteen of the 24 biopsy samples had adequate FFPE material to be assembled into a tissue microarray, and two to three cores of 0.6 mm diameter from the most infiltrated regions of each biopsy were digitally annotated and compiled into a tissue microarray. The tissue microarray was sectioned at 4-&#x00B5;m thickness and mounted onto Vectabond&#x2122;-treated (Vector Labs, #SP-1800) square glass coverslips (22&#x00D7;22 mm, #1 1/2, Electron Microscopy Sciences, #72204-01).</p>

<title>Multiplex immunohistochemistry and analysis</title>
<p>mIHC was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. Briefly, 4-&#x00B5;m FFPE tissue sections were baked for 1 h at 60 &#x00B0;C, dewaxed, and stained on a BOND Rx autostainer (Leica) according to Opal Multiplex IHC assay (Akoya Biosciences)s protocol with the following changes: additional high stringency washes were performed after the secondary antibody and Opal fluor applications using high-salt TBST (0.05M Tris, 0.3M NaCl and 0.1&#x0025; Tween-20, pH 7.2-7.6), and TCT was used as the blocking buffer (0.05M Tris, 0.15M NaCl, 0.25&#x0025; Casein, 0.1&#x0025; Tween 20, pH 7.6 &#x002B;/- 0.1). The antibody panel was stained in the following order, with antibody stripping between positions. Each primary antibody was incubated for 60 min, followed by 10-min incubation with secondary antibody (OPAL polymer HRP mouse plus rabbit, Akoya Biosciences), followed by application of the tertiary TSA-amplification reagent (OPAL Fluor, Akoya Biosciences) for 10 min. Positions were as follows: position 1: CD8 (clone CD8/144B, DAKO #M7103; concentration 0.8 &#x00B5;g/ml; OPAL Fluor 520); position 2: CD25 (clone 4C9, Cell Marque #125M-14; concentration 0.17 &#x00B5;g/ml; OPAL Fluor 540); position 3: CD3 (clone SP7, Thermo Fisher Scientific #RM-9107; concentration 0.06 &#x00B5;g/ml; OPAL Fluor 570); position 4: PD-1 (clone EPR4877(2), Abcam #ab137132, concentration 1.0 &#x00B5;g/ml; OPAL Fluor 650); position 5: CD7 (clone MRQ-56; Cell Marque #107M-24; concentration 1.18 &#x00B5;g/ml; OPAL Fluor 690); position 6: CD4 (clone EP204, Epitomics; #AC0173A; concentration 0.08 &#x00B5;g/ml; OPAL Fluor 480); and position 7: FoxP3 (clone 236A/E7; eBioscience #14-4777-82; 5.0 &#x00B5;g/ml; OPAL Fluor 620). Subsequently, slides were stained with Spectral DAPI (Akoya Biosciences) for 5 min, rinsed, and mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific #P36930). After curing for 24 h at room temperature in the dark, images were acquired on a Vectra Polaris automated quantitative pathology imaging system (Akoya Biosciences). The raw images were spectrally unmixed using the Phenoptics inForm software (Akoya Biosciences) and exported as multi-image TIFF files.</p>
<p>After fluorescent imaging, the slides were de-coverslipped, loaded onto the BOND Rx autostainer, stripped of bound antibody, and a post-mIHC staining for CXCL13 (goat polyclonal, R&#x0026;D Systems #AF801; concentration 0.5 &#x00B5;g/ml; incubation 60 min) was performed. Bound antibody was revealed by anti-goat HRP secondary ImmPress HRP (Vector Labs #MP-7405; incubation 12 min), followed by DAB chromogen using the BOND Polymer Refine Detection kit (Leica) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. After counterstaining with hematoxylin, slides were dry-mounted and scanned on an Aperio AT turbo digital slide scanning system (Leica).</p>
<p>HALO software (Indica Labs) was used to perform single-cell analysis of mIHC images. Cells were visualized based on nuclear and cytoplasmic stains, and mean pixel fluorescence intensity in the applicable compartments of each cell were measured (i.e., CD4 in the cytoplasmic compartment and FoxP3 in the nuclear compartment). A mean intensity threshold above background was used to determine positivity for each fluorochrome, thereby defining cells as either positive or negative for each marker. The data was then used to define co-localized populations, including PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, tumor cells, and Tregs. Spatial positions were extracted for each cell, and the spatial distances and ratios between these three cells types were calculated as detailed below. Performance of the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> biomarker was evaluated with the easyROC interface available with the R package shiny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>.

<title>CODEX multiplex tissue staining and imaging</title>
<p>The CODEX experiment was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Briefly, the coverslip was deparaffinized and rehydrated, and heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed using Dako target retrieval solution, pH 9 (Agilent, #S236784-2) at 97 &#x00B0;C for 10 min. The coverslip was stained with an antibody cocktail (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Sup.

After multiple fixation steps using 1.6&#x0025; paraformaldehyde, 100&#x0025; methanol, and BS3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #21580), the coverslip was mounted onto a custom-made acrylic plate (Bayview Plastic Solutions). Imaging was performed with a Keyence BZ-X710 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a CFI Plan Apo &#x03BB; 20x/0.75 objective (Nikon), an Akoya CODEX microfluidics instrument, and CODEX driver software (Akoya Biosciences). Light exposure times and the arrangement of cycles are outlined in <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Sup. Table 2</xref></bold>.

<title>Data processing of CODEX images</title>
<p>Raw TIFF image files were processed using the CODEX Toolkit as previously described. After processing, the staining quality for each antibody was visually assessed in each tissue microarray spot, and cell segmentation was performed using the DRAQ5 nuclear stain. Marker expression was quantified, and single-cell data were saved as FCS files, which were then imported into CellEngine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cellengine.com">https://cellengine.com</ext-link>) for cleanup gating. This resulted in a total of 117,170 cells across all tissue microarray spots.</p>
<p>After cleanup gating, FCS files were exported from CellEngine, imported into VorteX clustering software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>, and subjected to unsupervised X-shift clustering using an angular distance algorithm. Clustering was based on all antibody markers except CD11b, CD16, CD164, CCR4, CCR6, EGFR, and p53. The optimal cluster number was guided by the elbow point validation tool in VorteX, resulting in 78 clusters. Clusters were manually verified and assigned to cell-types based on morphology in H&#x0026;E and fluorescent CODEX images and on their marker expression profiles. Clusters with similar features were merged, resulting in 21 cell-type clusters. The expression frequencies of ICOS, IDO, Ki-67, and PD-1 were determined for the T cell and tumor cell clusters by manual gating in CellEngine for each tissue microarray spot, with visual comparison to the raw fluorescent image.</p>

For each of the 117,220 cells in this experiment, the window size was set at 10, capturing the center cell and its nine nearest neighboring cells, as measured by the Euclidean distance between X/Y coordinates. To identify 10 CNs, these windows were then clustered by the composition of their microenvironment with respect to the 21 cell-types that were previously identified. This resulted in a vector for each window containing the frequency of each of the 21 cell-types amongst the 10 neighborhoods. These windows were then clustered using Python&#x2019;s <italic>scikit-learn</italic> implementation of MiniBatchKMeans with <italic>k</italic>=10. Each cell was then allocated to the same CN as the window in which it was centered. All CN assignments were validated by overlaying them on the original fluorescent and H&#x0026;E-stained images.</p>

<title>Calculation of spatial distances and ratios between cell-types</title>
<p>The X/Y coordinates for each cell type were determined during cellular segmentation, as described above. The minimal distance between each cell-type and its nearest other cell-types, and the averages of these minimal distances per tissue spot, were calculated in R. Given our interest in the relationship of cell distances between three cell-types (i.e., effector T cells (CT1), tumor cells (CT2) and Tregs (CT3)), we calculated the ratio of the minimal distances between CT1&#x2014;CT2 (right distance) versus CT1&#x2014;CT3 (left distance). This distance ratio represented the <italic>SpatialScore</italic>. To assess whether these ratios were significantly different from those of a random sample, we performed the following analysis per spot: For the number of CT1 cells in each spot, we randomly selected the same number of non-CT1 (nCT1) cells. For each of these nCT1 cells, we calculated the ratio of the minimal distances (nCT1&#x2014;CT2 / nCT1&#x2014;CT3) and determined the mean of this sample. We repeated this random sampling 100 times, and the average of all the means was reported. Distribution of the random values was assessed by the quant output variable, which indicates how many of the random means are smaller than the measured means. For instance, a quant of 97 indicates that 97&#x0025; of the random means are smaller than the measured means. Thus, quant values closer to 100 or 0 indicate that the measured means are not random (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4j-m</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Laser-capture microdissection (LCM)</title>
<p>Two serial sections of the tissue microarray were taken at 7 &#x00B5;m thickness and mounted onto frame slides with polyethylene naphthalate membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #LCM0521). Slides were immersed for 20 s each in xylene (three times), 100&#x0025; ethanol (three times), 95&#x0025; ethanol (two times), 70&#x0025; ethanol (two times), water, hematoxylin (Dako, #S3309), water, bluing reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #7301), water, 70&#x0025; ethanol (two times), 95&#x0025; ethanol (two times), 100&#x0025; ethanol (three times), and xylene (three times). Immediately after staining, cells were dissected from every tissue microarray spot on an ArcturusXT LCM System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the ultraviolet laser to cut out the desired region and the infrared laser to adhere the membrane to a CapSure HS LCM Cap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #LCM0215). A tissue area containing roughly 1000 mononuclear cells was captured from each spot, with cell numbers determined based on density estimates by cell counting in an adjacent H&#x0026;E-stained section. If a core had more than 1000 mononuclear cells, a tissue fragment containing around 1000 mononuclear cells was dissected from that core. If a core had less than 1000 cells, tissue fragments from corresponding cores on the serial section membrane were combined in the same LCM cap to obtain approximately 1000 cells. After microdissection, the caps were sealed using 0.5-ml tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #N8010611) and stored at &#x2212;80 &#x00B0;C until cDNA library preparation.</p>

Briefly, 10 &#x00B5;l of lysis mix consisting of 40&#x0025; (v/v) 5 M trimethylglycine solution (Sigma, #B0300), 20&#x0025; (v/v) 10 mM nuclease-free dNTP mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #R0192), 10&#x0025; (v/v) 20 &#x00B5;M first-strand primer in TE buffer (1S, /5Biosg/GT GAC TGG AGT TCA GAC GTG TGC TCT TCC GAT CTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TV; Integrated DNA Technologies), 10&#x0025; (v/v) Triton-X 100 (Sigma #T8787; diluted to 0.5&#x0025; v/v in molecular biology-grade water), and 20&#x0025; (v/v) Proteinase K (New England Biolabs, #P8107S; diluted to 0.125 mg/ml in in molecular biology-grade water) was added to the center of each LCM cap. Caps were sealed with 0.2 ml low-retention PCR tubes (Corning, #PCR-02-L-C) and incubated on a pre-warmed metal CapSure incubation block (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #LCM0505) at 60 &#x00B0;C in an incubator. Then, tubes were briefly centrifuged, and 10 &#x00B5;l of template-switching reverse-transcription (TS-RT) FFPE LCM mix consisting of 40&#x0025; (v/v) 5x SMARTScribe first-strand reaction buffer (Clontech, #639537), 20&#x0025; (v/v) 20 mM DTT (Clontech, #639537), 10&#x0025; (v/v) 20x RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #AM2694), 4&#x0025; (v/v) 50 &#x00B5;M second-strand primer in TE buffer (2S, /5Biosg/CT ACA CGA CGC TCT TCC GAT CTN NNN NrGrG rG; Integrated DNA Technologies), 4&#x0025; (v/v) 200 mM MgCl2 (Sigma, #63069), 2&#x0025; 5 mM proteinase K inhibitor (EMD Millipore, #539470), and 20&#x0025; (v/v) 100 U/&#x00B5;l SMARTScribe reverse transcriptase (Clontech, #639537) was added. Samples were incubated in a programmable thermal cycler (42 &#x00B0;C for 30 min, 70 &#x00B0;C for 10 min, 4 &#x00B0;C hold), and 1.25 &#x00B5;l of a unique P5 primer and 1.25 &#x00B5;l of a universal P7 primer (2 &#x00B5;M in TE buffer each; Integrated DNA Technologies; sequences available upon request) and HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa, #KK2601) were then added, followed by 22 cycles of PCR amplification (98 &#x00B0;C for 45 s; 22 cycles at 98 &#x00B0;C for 15 s, 60 &#x00B0;C for 30 s, 72 &#x00B0;C for 10 s; then 72 &#x00B0;C for 60 s, and 4 &#x00B0;C hold). Amplified cDNA was next purified with SPRI bead mix (Beckman Coulter, #B23317) and a magnetic separation block (V&#x0026;P Scientific, #VP772F4). Finally, the samples were washed with 80&#x0025; ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer to yield the sequencing-ready library.</p>

Libraries were excluded if &#x003C;40&#x0025; of their transcripts were within a 165-500 bp range. A total of 64 libraries were mixed to equimolarity, according to the qPCR measurements. The RNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument with a High Output v2.5 reagent kit (Illumina, #20024906) to a minimum sequencing depth of1.5 M reads per sample (mean: 3.7 M) and minimum uniquely aligned reads of 364,468 per sample (mean: 916,607) using read lengths of 76 nucleotides (nt) for read 1 and 8 nt for read 2. On average, we obtained reads from 11,166 genes per sample (median: 11,267) and 379,615 unique transcripts per sample (median: 336,005), which is comparable to previously published FFPE-based RNA-seq studies of human cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Identifying bulk RNAseq gene signatures associated with tumor cells and the <italic>SpatialScore</italic></title>
<p>LASSO regression models were used to find genes predictive of tumor cells and the <italic>SpatialScore</italic>. These models were estimated using the LassoCV object in the scikit-learn python package. Six-fold cross validation was used to select the optimal regularization parameter. Specifically, an L1-regularized linear model was fit to predict the frequency of tumor cells from the gene expression data per tissue microarray spot. For this model, the response variable was the log transformed per spot percentage of tumor cells. A pseudo-count of 1&#x0025; was added to genes. The features utilized as predictors were the per spot log transformed TPM counts and the log frequency of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells. Genes with positive nonzero coefficients were interpreted as positively associated with tumor cells. Similarly, an L1-regularized linear model was fit to predict the <italic>SpatialScore</italic> from the gene expression data on a per spot basis. For this model, the response variable was the log transformed <italic>SpatialScore</italic> distance ratio. The features used as predictors were the per spot log transformed TPM counts.
