<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Type I and III interferons (IFN-I/&#x03BB;) are key antiviral mediators against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrate that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the predominant IFN-I/&#x03BB; source following their sensing of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Mechanistically, this short-range sensing by pDCs requires sustained integrin-mediated cell adhesion with infected cells. In turn, pDCs restrict viral spread by an IFN-I/&#x03BB; response directed toward SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. This specialized function enables pDCs to efficiently turn-off viral replication, likely <italic>via</italic> a local response at the contact site with infected cells. By exploring the pDC response in SARS-CoV-2 patients, we further demonstrate that pDC responsiveness inversely correlates with the severity of the disease. The pDC response is particularly impaired in severe COVID-19 patients. Overall, we propose that pDC activation is essential to control SARS-CoV-2-infection. Failure to unfold this response could be key to understand severe cases of COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The innate immune system acts as the first line of defense for the sensing of viral infection. This involves rapid recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including viral nucleic acids, by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). This recognition results in an antiviral response characterized by the production of type I and III (&#x03BB;) interferons (IFN) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, along with the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Whilst type I and III/&#x03BB; IFNs interact with distinct receptors, they both induce similar signaling pathways and effector factors, thus referred herein to as the IFN-I/&#x03BB; response<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></bold></sup>. This host response suppresses viral spread by blocking the viral life cycle at multiple levels, hereby promoting virus clearance. The IFN-I/&#x03BB; response also mediates immunomodulatory effects in surrounding tissues and imparts the onset of the adaptive immune response<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></bold></sup>.</p>
<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and is responsible for the still-ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></bold></sup>. Although most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals experience asymptomatic to mild disease, others develop respiratory distress syndrome that is lethal in the most severe cases. Importantly, the IFN-I/&#x03BB; response is now thought to be a critical host response against SARS-CoV-2 infection and its pathogenesis<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></bold></sup>. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can evade from the initial control by the IFN-I/&#x03BB; response <italic>via</italic> manifold inhibitory mechanisms interfering with both the sensing and the signaling pathways within infected cells (review articles<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></bold></sup> and illustrated in previous works<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></bold></sup>). This immune evasion might lead to an increased viral load, followed by widespread inflammation<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></bold></sup>. Individual immune responses against viral infection can thus be extremely heterogenous, ranging from robust and fast IFN-I/&#x03BB; production to impaired IFN-I/&#x03BB;-mediated immunity. IFN-I/&#x03BB; response is thus pivotal for the host defense against respiratory infections. Timing of the IFN-I/&#x03BB; production also plays a crucial role in related Coronaviruses (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1)<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></bold></sup>. Delayed IFN-I/&#x03BB; signaling is associated with robust virus replication and promotes the accumulation of pathological monocyte-macrophages<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></bold></sup>. This results in lung immunopathology, vascular leakage and suboptimal T cell responses. Along this line, early reports on SARS-CoV-2 suggest that severe COVID-19 featured low level of IFN-I/&#x03BB; but overproduction of inflammatory cytokines<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></bold></sup>. Accordingly, genetic deficiency, neutralization by autoantibodies directed against the IFN&#x2212;I system, or viral-mediated inhibition of the IFN-I/&#x03BB; response aggravates SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></bold></sup>. It is therefore critical to understand the regulation of the optimal production and activity of IFN-I/&#x03BB;.</p>
<p>The plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a unique immune cell type specialized for rapid and massive production of IFN-I/&#x03BB;<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></bold></sup>. pDCs possess multiple adaptations to efficiently produce IFN-I/&#x03BB;<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></bold></sup>. As pDCs are refractory to most viral infections, their response is not directly repressed by viral proteins. This particularity contributes to the exceptional magnitude of pDC IFN-I/&#x03BB; production<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></bold></sup>. The main viral-sensors responsible for pDC activation are Toll-like receptors (TLR)-7 and -9 that recognize viral RNA and DNA, respectively<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></bold></sup>. A recent report suggested that pDCs activated by SARS-CoV-2 differentiate into cytokine- and IFN-secreting effector cells, in a TLR-dependent manner<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></bold></sup>. Studies on related coronaviruses have demonstrated that pDCs migration into the lungs, and their rapid production of IFN-I is essential for the control of lethal infections by these coronaviruses<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></bold></sup>. Nonetheless, how pDCs respond to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and how this response correlates with the progression of COVID-19 severity are still open questions.</p>
<p>Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the IFN-I/&#x03BB; response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results uncovered that pDCs establish cell contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected cells <italic>via</italic> &#x03B1;<sub>L</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>2</sub> integrin/ICAM-1 adhesion complex and regulators of actin network. This physical contact between pDCs and infected cells is required for the pDC-mediated antiviral response by TLR7 recognition. Capitalizing on our findings that pDCs strongly respond by physical sensing of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we then showed that impaired pDC IFN-I/&#x03BB; response associates with COVID-19 severity. It is now increasingly recognized that pDCs differentiate into different subsets with distinct phenotypes and functionalities. Here, we showed that the differentiation of pDCs into subsets is altered when stimulated by contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells as compared to other activation. Especially, when in contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, pDCs preferentially differentiate into a subset, which efficiently produces IFN-I/&#x03BB;, then leading to a robust antiviral control directed towards the infected cells.</p>

<title>Robust activation of pDCs in response to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells</title>
<p>Respiratory epithelial cells represent the first infected tissue in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate which hematopoietic cell type is primarily responsible for the IFN-I/&#x03BB; response against SARS-CoV-2 infection, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from healthy donors were cocultured with SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung-derived cells. Calu-3 cells and A549-ACE2 cells (expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) were infected for 48 hours prior to coculture with PBMCs (including pDCs) for 16-18 hours. We found that PBMCs respond by a robust secretion of IFN&#x03B1; when cocultured with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref></bold>). In contrast, the supernatants (SN) of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells failed to trigger IFN&#x03B1; secretion by PBMCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref></bold>). As expected from previous publications, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells did not produce themselves detectable level of IFN&#x03B1;<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></bold></sup>. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are known to robustly produce IFN-I/&#x03BB;, notably IFN&#x03B1; <sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></bold></sup>. In line with this, antibody mediated-depletion of pDCs from PBMCs abolished IFN&#x03B1; secretion in response to co-cultured SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref></bold>). To further demonstrate that pDCs are the major source of IFN&#x03B1; upon incubation with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, pDCs were purified from PBMCs. Purified pDCs potently produced IFN&#x03B1; in response to co-culture with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref>)</bold>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Consistent with these results, we further showed that IFN&#x03B1; producer cells were markedly enriched in the cell population gated as pDCs as compared to other hematopoietic cell types (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., non-pDCs): no IFN&#x03B1;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells detected among non-pDCs <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c-d</xref>)</bold>. Most IFN&#x03B1;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> pDCs concomitantly produced IFN&#x03BB; in response to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c-d</xref>)</bold>. In contrast, stimulation by soluble agonist elicited IFN&#x03BB;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> pDCs, but no detectable IFN&#x03B1;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c-d</xref>)</bold> and a potent upregulation of surface expression of activation markers including CD83 and the programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) as compared to coculture with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (<italic>data not shown</italic><bold>)</bold>. This suggested that the pDC response to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells is likely qualitatively distinct from stimulation by soluble agonist. CD83 and PD-L1 are induced by NF-&#x03BA;B-signaling, and thus dependent on signaling distinct from the IFN-I/&#x03BB; response<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></bold></sup>.</p>
<p>Next, we tested whether the sensing of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells required a productive infection of pDCs, using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 infectious clone expressing the mNeongreen reporter (icSARS-CoV-2-mNG<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></bold></sup>). No infection of pDCs (defined as CTV<sup>&#x002B;</sup>-pDCs<bold>)</bold> was detected when pDCs were incubated in contact with icSARS-CoV-2-mNG-infected A549-ACE2 cells (<italic>data not shown</italic><bold>)</bold>. However, in the same coculture set up, infection by icSARS-CoV-2-mNG was readily detected in initially uninfected/naive RFP<sup>&#x002B;</sup> A549-ACE2 cells, hence proving validation of efficient viral transmission.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results strongly suggest that IFN&#x03B1; is robustly produced only by pDCs. This occurs by sensing of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells without productive infection and likely induces a specific activation state in pDCs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Short-range sensing of infected cells <italic>via</italic> cell-contact triggers the pDC IFN&#x03B1; response</title>
<p>We observed that cell-free SN from SARS-CoV-2-infected cell types failed to trigger IFN&#x03B1; production by PBMCs or by purified pDCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref>)</bold>. To avoid possible misinterpretation due to contamination by cell debris and/or floating cells<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></bold></sup>, we selected an incubation time for SARS-CoV-2 infection so that no cytolytic effect was detectable in infected human lung-derived cells when cells/SNs were collected for coculture. Nevertheless, no pDC activation by cell-free SN was readily detected even at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 per pDC. To further determine if cell-to-cell contacts were required for the transmission of the immunostimulatory signal to pDCs, we used transwell chambers containing SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and pDCs separated by a 0.4&#x03BC;m permeable membrane. This physical cell separation fully prevented IFN&#x03B1; production by pDCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e-f</xref></bold>). To confirm that this feature was not cell type specific, we used a variety of lung-derived cell lines Calu-3, A549-ACE2, H358-ACE2 as well as non-lung Huh7.5.1 cells. We found that pDCs were not stimulated by cell-free virus produced by any of these cells not in presence of infected cells but physically separated, while they were activated by all tested SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e-f</xref></bold>). Remarkably, similar levels of IFN&#x03B1; secretion were reproducibly obtained for pDCs isolated from several distinct healthy donors (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref></bold>; as n=11 and n=15 healthy donors for A549-ACE2 and Calu-3 cells, respectively).</p>
<p>To further define the mechanisms underlying pDC activation upon contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we assessed the implication of cell adhesion complexes in this process. We focused on &#x03B1;<sub>L</sub> integrin and its ligand Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM)-1 (also called CD54) <sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></bold></sup>, respectively, highly expressed by pDCs and by various cell types, guided by previous studies on the regulation of pDCs in the context of other infections <sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></bold></sup>. Antibody-mediated blockade of both &#x03B1;<sub>L</sub> integrin and ICAM-1 greatly prevented pDC IFN&#x03B1; production (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref></bold> and <italic>data not shown</italic>). The engagement of integrins by their ligands is known to induce local recruitment of the actin network. Notably Arp2/3 complex mediates actin nucleation by recruiting and branching actin filaments within the network<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></bold></sup>. Pharmacological inhibition of Arp2/3 complex impaired IFN&#x03B1; production by pDCs in coculture with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, in a dose dependent-manner (<italic>data not shown</italic>). This suggested that cell adhesion-induced actin recruitment is likely involved in the structuration of cell contacts. Furthermore, using specific TLR7 antagonist (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., IRS661), we showed that the endosome-localized TLR7 sensor mediates the sensing of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells by pDCs (<italic>data not shown</italic>).</p>
<p>Together our results demonstrated that physical contact between pDCs and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells is required for pDC IFN&#x03B1; production. This contact involves cell adhesion mediated by &#x03B1;<sub>L</sub> integrin/ICAM-1 complexes, which likely remobilize the actin network at the cell-to-cell contact, and leads to a robust TLR7-dependent IFN&#x03B1; response by the pDCs.</p>

<title>IFN-I/&#x03BB; signature in patients at early time-point of SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
<p>Based on the findings that pDCs are the main cell type producing IFN&#x03B1; in response to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we sought to explore how this singular activation mechanism for IFN-I/&#x03BB; response is modulated in the course of the infection in patients and how it could relate to COVID-19 severity. A longitudinal study of IFN-I/&#x03BB; response was done with different subsets of patients: <italic>i)</italic> critically ill, herein referred to as <italic>Severe</italic> patients, who presented acute respiratory distress syndrome or severe pneumonia at hospital admission and required mechanical ventilation in intensive care units, and <italic>ii)</italic> patients with mild symptoms (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., low-grade fever, cough, malaise, rhinorrhea, sore throat), that group was sub-divided according to the days of sample collection post-symptom onset, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., <italic>Mild early</italic> for the first two weeks and <italic>Mild late</italic> at the later time points. Of note, most patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive in nasal swab samples by qPCR at sampling time in the <italic>Mild early</italic> group but not anymore or presenting low viral levels in the <italic>Mild late</italic> group. All patients and the analyzed time-points are listed (<italic>data not shown</italic>), which provides information on the clinic and viral loads in nasal swab samples.</p>
<p>We quantified the IFN-I/&#x03BB; levels in blood samples of infected patients at both transcriptional and protein levels for secreted IFN&#x03B1;, IFN&#x03BB;1, IFN&#x03B3; and IL-6. Both approaches revealed an elevated IFN-I/&#x03BB; response at early time points (within the first 10-11 days post-onset of symptoms) for all patients with mild symptoms, that seemed to vanish over time, mirroring the controlled decrease of the viral load (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). The IFN-I/&#x03BB; response was elevated in <italic>Severe</italic> patients even at late time-points. Of note, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 was greatly detected in <italic>Severe</italic> patients as compared to other groups (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>).

<p>We then determined the ability of PBMCs isolated from the different groups of patients to respond to <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. As our results pointed out the importance of pDCs in the IFN-I/&#x03BB; response mounted against SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we primarily analyzed pDCs. This response was compared to the one induced by TLR7 [R848]/TLR3[polyI:C] agonist. A group of <italic>healthy</italic> donors comprising similarly treated samples was used as reference.

<title>COVID-19 severity correlates with a blunted pDC IFN&#x03B1; response to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells</title>
<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) of the flow cytometry datasets was performed within gated pDCs and for each stimulation condition to test whether differences in activation and cytokine expression could be linked to COVID-19 severity (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-c</xref></bold>). PCA allows to reduce high dimensional data into principal components that maximize the variance of the projected data and potentially identify the underlying factors associated with it. Each patient is placed with respect to its distribution in the first two principal components (PCs), which explain most of the data variance (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>), and vectors corresponding to the eigen decomposition of the data covariance matrix are depicted to identify features that explain the observed variance (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>). For pDCs analyzed in the unstimulated condition, the first two principal components (PCs) revealed a differential segregation of the patients: the <italic>Severe</italic> group (in red), and to some extent <italic>mild early</italic> group (in purple) were mainly spread across the first PC (which was explained by IFN&#x03B1;, CD80 and PD-L1), while <italic>healthy</italic> and <italic>Mild late</italic> individuals were tightly clustered in both PCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-c</xref></bold>, left panels). An opposite segregation of the patient groups was observed in pDCs when PBMCs were cocultured with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-c</xref></bold>, middle panels). Especially, this stimulation induced a spread across the first PC (mainly driven by IFN&#x03B1;/IFN&#x03B1;<sup>hi</sup> and CD83 expression) of patients from the <italic>Mild</italic> and <italic>healthy</italic> groups, in accordance with the pDC ability to respond to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>, middle panel). Of note, the <italic>healthy</italic> individuals were spread across the two PCs, whereas the <italic>Mild early and Mild late</italic> groups dispersed primarily along the first PCs. On the contrary, individuals from the <italic>Severe</italic> group were spread across the second PC (driven by CD80 and PD-L1 expression). Regarding pDC response to synthetic agonist, all groups were similarly spread across the first and second PCs, while the <italic>Severe</italic> group was tightly grouped within the second PC (driven by IFN&#x03BB; expression) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-c</xref></bold>, right panels). These results suggested that pDCs from <italic>Severe</italic> individuals display differences in activation markers and cytokine expression (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., IFN&#x03B1;, CD80, CD83) compared to individuals from all the other groups. These differences were particularly observed in absence of stimulation and upon stimulated by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.</p>
<p>We further analyzed the expression of activation markers and cytokines individually at the single-cell level, focusing first on markers identified as driving forces in the PCA analyses. Similar to <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>, the frequency of IFN&#x03B1; producer pDCs greatly increased in response to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells in the <italic>healthy</italic> donor group (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>, green arrows). In sharp contrast, pDCs from <italic>Severe</italic> patients failed to be activated by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells as revealed by the absence or low detection of IFN&#x03B1;, IFN&#x03BB; and CD83 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-f</xref></bold>; red bars and arrows). Of note, a strong basal level of pDC IFN&#x03B1; expression was observed in the absence of <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation for the <italic>Severe</italic> patients (using less stringent discriminative gating of positive pDCs, noted distinctively as to IFN&#x03B1;<sup>&#x002B;all</sup>; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). The response to agonist stimulation was also greatly diminished in pDCs from <italic>Severe</italic> patients compared to <italic>healthy</italic> donors and patients with <italic>mild</italic> symptoms, notably as shown by the level of activation markers (CD83, CD80 and PD-L1; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f-h</xref></bold>; red arrows). Overall the results obtained by analyses of the markers individually were in agreement with the PCA data, since the major change in pDC responsiveness concerned <italic>Severe</italic> patients as compared to the other groups. As highlighted in the identified first PCs of PCA analysis, this difference was primarily explained by lack of IFN&#x03B1; and CD83 expression in pDCs upon stimulation by SARS-COV-2-infected cells.</p>
<p>In addition to pDCs, other cell types were also selected for multiparametric flow cytometry analysis based on their potential to play pivotal first defense against viruses. Especially, the Th1-promoting myeloid/conventional dendritic cell subset (mDC1), which produces IFN&#x03BB; <italic>via</italic> TLR3-mediated recognition of viral RNA and the Th2-promoting myeloid/conventional DC subset (mDC2) and monocytes <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., Human Leukocyte Antigen &#x2013; DR isotype (HLA-DR)<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD14<sup>&#x002B;</sup> populations, known to produce proinflammatory cytokines<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></bold></sup>. In line with the results obtained with pDCs, expression of IFN&#x03BB;1 was barely detectable in the mDC1 subset of <italic>Severe</italic> patients upon stimulation by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and agonists, comparatively to the other groups (<italic>data not shown</italic>). As expected, in other cell population <italic>(i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., mDC1, mDC2, non-mDC2 and HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD14<sup>&#x002B;</sup> populations), other markers (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., IFN&#x03B1;, IL6, CD83, CD80 and PD-L1) were not readily induced by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells even in <italic>healthy</italic> donors (data not shown). Nevertheless, our data showed a potent upregulation of IL6 by HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD14<sup>&#x002B;</sup> subset upon agonist treatment in <italic>Severe</italic> patients and <italic>Mild early</italic> (<italic>data not shown</italic>). HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD14<sup>&#x002B;</sup> population represents a highly frequent cell subset of non-mDC2 (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., among the gated live cells<sup>&#x002B;</sup> lin<sup>-</sup> HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>: 65.7&#x0025; and with exclusion of the few mDC2<bold>)</bold>. In accordance, a high frequency of IL6<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells was also observed for the non-mDC2 populations (<italic>data not shown</italic>). Likewise, <italic>Severe</italic> patients presented an elevated level of blood IL6 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). These results are consistent with the previously reported production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytic cells in patients with severe disease<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></bold></sup>, and provided further insights into the differential responses of other immune cells.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Dynamics of the IFN-I/<italic>&#x03BB;</italic> response in COVID-19 patients</title>
<p>Next, we sought to define the dynamics of the response in COVID-19 patients. First, kinetic analyses in <italic>Mild</italic> patients revealed an elevated frequency of pDC IFN&#x03B1;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> levels in absence of stimulation that vanished over time while, relatively, their ability to respond to SARS-COV-2-infected cells increased at late time-points (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref></bold>, left panel). A limited induction of pDC IFN&#x03B1;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> in response to SARS-COV-2-infected cells was observed in <italic>Severe</italic> patients at all analysed time-points (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref></bold>, right panel). We next performed a kinetic analysis for a <italic>Severe</italic> patient, who had high level of anti-IFN&#x03B1; antibody detected in the blood (<italic>data not shown</italic>)<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></bold></sup>. This analysis showed that the ability of pDC to respond to stimulation was blunted in this patient (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref></bold>, right panel; represented by stars with yellow-center). The kinetic of pDC IFN&#x03BB;<sup>&#x002B;</sup> response presented a similar pattern for both <italic>Mild</italic> and <italic>Severe</italic> groups with basal level in absence of stimulation at early time-points and low response to SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, while pDC response recovered at late time, and this was paralleled by the IL6<sup>&#x002B;</sup> frequency in HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD14<sup>&#x002B;</sup> population (<italic>data not shown</italic>).</p>
<p>Together our results demonstrated that the monocytic subsets likely contribute to an exacerbated pro-inflammatory response implying notably IL6 production, but that is liklely not triggered directly by the contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. As opposed, impaired IFN-I/&#x03BB; response following cell contact between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and pDCs from <italic>Severe</italic> patients, including those with anti-IFN&#x03B1; antibodies, suggested a &#x2018;<italic>silencing/unresponsive state</italic>&#x2019; of pDCs in this context. This might be due to the lack of an amplification-loop by ISG resulting in lower activated state and IFN&#x03B1; production by pDCs and to some extent, similarly for IFN&#x03BB;1 expression by mDC1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Limited pDC differentiation and cytotoxic activity when in contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells</title>
<p>As we found that pDC activation is a salient feature that negatively correlates with COVID-19 severity, we aimed to determine how the contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells impacts the varied downstream signaling and function of pDCs. First, we analyzed the expression of pDC surface molecules enabling the stimulation of adaptive responses, namely HLA-DR, an MHC class II cell surface receptor driving the activation of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, and the B cell ligand CD70 expressed by pDCs and known to interact with CD27 and to induce proliferation and differentiation of B cells into plasmablast<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></bold></sup>. Our results showed that pDCs upregulated both surface molecules in response to contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, although at a lower level compared to stimulation by cell-free virus (influenza virus; flu) and synthetic agonists (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-b</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Similarly, surface expression of CD83, an activation marker for antigen presenting cells<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></bold></sup> was induced jointly with PD-L1 upon contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cell (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref></bold>). SN from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells induced HLA-DR, CD83 and PD-L1 expression, but not as potently as other soluble agonists. These results obtained with purified pDCs are in agreement with results obtained with pDCs present in PBMCs cocultured with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>pDCs are now recognized to be a heterogeneous population composed of subsets endowed with diversified functions<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></bold></sup>. Importantly, stimulation of pDCs can impact the frequency and phenotype of these diversified subsets. We thus assessed the expression of a set of surface molecules previously assigned to define specific subpopulations of pDCs, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., CD2, CD5, AXL, CD80 and PD-L1<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></bold></sup>. CD2<sup>hi</sup> pDCs have a survival advantage and are able to efficiently trigger proliferation of naive allogenic T cells<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></bold></sup>. Stimulation of pDCs by contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells did not impact the frequency of CD2<sup>hi</sup> pDCs, and this CD2<sup>hi</sup> subset displayed an activation profile similar to the one of CD2<sup>low</sup> subset (<italic>data not shown</italic>). CD2<sup>hi</sup>CD5<sup>&#x002B;</sup>AXL<sup>&#x002B;</sup> pDCs were defined as a subset that display limited IFN-I production capacity but can potently activate T cells, but represent a very scarce subpopulation of pDCs<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></bold></sup>. The CD2<sup>hi</sup>CD5<sup>&#x002B;</sup>AXL<sup>&#x002B;</sup> pDCs modestly decreased upon stimulation by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, their SN or TLR-agonists, yet whether this intriguing decrease is relative to the activated state of pDCs requires further investigation (<italic>data not shown</italic>). We then addressed the diversification of pDCs into functionally distinct populations defined by PD-L1/CD80 expression. In agreement with previous reports, the stimulation by cell-free agonists and influenza virus triggered the differentiation into all subsets: PD-L1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD80<sup>-</sup>, PD-L1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD80<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and PD-L1<sup>-</sup>CD80<sup>&#x002B;</sup> pDCs<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></bold></sup>. In sharp contrast, direct contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells restricted the differentiation of pDCs only towards the PD-L1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD80<sup>-</sup> subset (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results revealed that, unlike activation by cell-free viruses and agonists, direct activation of pDCs by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells restricted their differentiation into specific functional subsets, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., inducing a maturation only into PD-L1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD80<sup>-</sup> subset.</p>
<p>We observed that pDCs expressed PD-L1 (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., programmed cell death ligand-1) when cocultured with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Therefore, we further examined the induction of cytotoxic activity of pDCs. In keeping with the previously-reported induction of membrane-bound TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (mTRAIL) expression by pDCs upon viral stimulation (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., HIV)<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></bold></sup>, we found that mTRAIL was readily co-expressed along with PD-L1 and CD83 upon stimulation by influenza virus and synthetic agonists (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, mTRAIL upregulation was more limited upon pDC coculture with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells as compared to stimulation by cell-free stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref></bold>, total &#x0025; of the bars). Moreover, the frequencies of Annexin V<sup>&#x002B;</sup>/7-ADD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> apoptotic Calu-3 and A549-ACE2 cells in cocultures with pDCs were similar between infected (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., pDC activation) and uninfected (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., no pDC activation) conditions, hence suggesting that mTRAIL expression on activated pDCs did not endow these cells with cytotoxic activity (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref></bold>). In line with this, the contact with activated pDCs did not markedly impact the viability of the cocultured SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., when comparing condition with or without the anti-&#x03B1;<sub>L</sub> integrin, which inhibits contact and pDC activation), nor the viability of activated pDCs themselves, even when analyzed after 48 hours of coculture (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Overall, these results showed that activation of pDCs by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells did not induce cytotoxic activity and led to their preferential diversification into functional pDC subsets known to be specifically able to robustly produce IFN-I/&#x03BB;.</p>

<p>We then sought to examine deeper the signaling pathways at play in pDCs upon activation by coculture with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. TLR7-dependent activation of pDCs can induce a &#x2018;bifurcated&#x2019; signaling leading to <italic>(1)</italic> IFN-I/&#x03BB; production mostly <italic>via</italic> IRF7-related signaling and other cytokines and <italic>(2)</italic> activation/differentiation markers and inflammatory cytokines <italic>via</italic> NF-&#x03BA;B-pathway<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></bold></sup>. We noticed that expression of the activation markers HLA-DR, CD70, CD83, mTRAIL by pDCs was weaker when induced by contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells compared to soluble agonist stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>). These markers/proteins are primarily regulated by NF-&#x03BA;B-mediated signaling (<italic>data not shown</italic>)<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></bold></sup>.

Cocultures of pDCs and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells induced more the IRF7/IFN-I-regulated molecules than the representatives of the NF-&#x03BA;B-pathway (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>). This was again confirmed by the quantification of secreted cytokines in the cocultures, demonstrating higher levels of IRF7/IFN-I-regulated IFN&#x03BB;1/2/3 compared to TNF&#x03B1; (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold> compared to <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref></bold>). This observation was also in agreement with the high level of secreted IFN&#x03B1; in similar experiments (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref></bold>). Of note, no detectable cytokine and low level of the corresponding transcript expression were detected in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells in the absence of pDCs, or when pDCs were stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 SNs. In these assays, the detection included expression by both pDCs and coculture infected cells. Thus, the low activation level of the NF-&#x03BA;B-pathway and/or its variability among different infected cell types can be explained by a contribution of the infected cells, as a feedback loop of the response to activated pDCs. Hence, we assessed cytokine expression at single-cell level by flow cytometry in the gated pDCs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref></bold>). Stimulation by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells elicited higher frequency of IFN<italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> pDCs compared to TNF<italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> pDCs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref></bold>) and again, this result contrasted with the limited frequency of IFN<italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> pDCs in response to cell-free agonist. Remarkably, almost all TNF<italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> pDCs were also IFN<italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> when stimulated by contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, as opposed to the detection of TNF<italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup>IFN<italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sup>-</sup> pDCs not IFN<italic>&#x03B1;</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> when stimulated by cell-free influenza virus <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>)</bold>.

<p>Collectively, our data provided evidence that, in contrast to stimulation with cell-free viruses and agonists, the pDC response to contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells is biased towards IRF7-mediated signaling that leads to a robust IFN-I/&#x03BB; production.</p>

<title>The pDC response controls SARS-CoV-2 spread and replication</title>
<p>As the response to SARS-CoV-2-infected cell primarily induced IFN-I/&#x03BB; antiviral signaling, we next aimed to define how the pDC response inhibits viral propagation. pDCs were cocultured for 48 hours with icSARS-CoV-2-mNG-infected A549-ACE2 cells (mNG<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) and uninfected A549-ACE2 RFP<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells, and viral spread was quantified by flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that the pDC response readily prevented viral spread from mNG<sup>&#x002B;</sup> infected cells to initially uninfected RFP<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f-g</xref></bold>). The inhibition of contact between pDCs and infected cells <italic>via</italic> blockade of &#x03B1;<sub>L</sub> integrin restored viral propagation to levels comparable to those measured in the absence of pDC (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f-g</xref></bold>). This indicated that the establishment of cell-contact <italic>via</italic> adhesion molecules is required for pDC-mediated antiviral response.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the impact of pDC antiviral response on cells infected prior to coculture (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., RFP<sup>-</sup>mNG<sup>&#x002B;</sup> infected cells) was lower as compared to the spread to uninfected cells (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., RFP<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f-g</xref></bold>). This is likely owing to the inhibition of IFN-I/&#x03BB; signaling by SARS-CoV-2 within infected cells<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></bold></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that the reduction could be more potent if infected cells were directly in contact with pDCs as such contact could allow a concentrated antiviral response toward the infected cell. To test this hypothesis, we established an assay of 24 hour-long live-imaging of the coculture of pDCs (stained with CM-Dil; red) and icSARS-CoV-2-mNG infected cells (mNG<sup>&#x002B;</sup>; green) using spinning-disk confocal microscopy. As depicted by the example of time-sequence imaging (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>), pDC contact with mNG<sup>&#x002B;</sup> infected cells lead to a control of viral replication in the targeted infected cells, reflected by the decreased mNG fluorescent reporter signal. We controlled that these infected cells, although not mNG<sup>&#x002B;</sup> anymore, were still physically present by using enhanced fluorescent signal analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref></bold>; lower panels). Viral control by pDCs was seen for pDC/infected cell contacts starting at different time points in the course of the coculture (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., up to 14 hours after record onset, <italic>data not shown</italic>). Similar analysis performed for several infected cells, either in contact with a pDC <italic>versus</italic> not in contact, revealed that the decrease in viral replication (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., mNG fluorescence intensity) was observed only for infected cells directly in contact with pDCs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b, d-e</xref></bold>). Of note, live-tracking of mNG fluorescence intensity performed in infected cells cultured without pDCs, provided the basal level of the mNG fluorescence intensity (done simultaneously with record of coculture with infected cells). This basal level was comparable to the one measured in infected cells cocultured with pDCs that were not in direct contact with infected cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c-d</xref></bold>). pDCs established long-lasting contact with infected cells <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., mostly above 10 hours, and accordingly, the decrease in mNG fluorescence intensity was detected several hours after the onset of contact, likely owing to the time-window needed to inhibit viral replication (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e-f</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we demonstrate that pDCs are the key mediators of the IFN-I/&#x03BB; response against SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Importantly, our study of immune cells from COVID-19 patients at the single-cell and functional levels establishes that the pDC response is pivotal to control COVID-19 severity. Especially, the sensing of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells is defective in patients with severe disease. As opposed, in healthy donors the scanning function of pDCs for immune surveillance operates <italic>via</italic> the establishment of sustained contacts with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells <italic>by</italic> cell adhesion molecules. This sensing induces IRF7/IFN-I/&#x03BB;-prioritized signaling in pDCs, while leaving inactive the NF-&#x03BA;B-mediated pathway. Next, the pDC-mediated IFN-I/&#x03BB; response is specifically targeted towards SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This specialized function thus enables pDCs to efficiently turn-off viral replication, likely owing to a concentrated efflux of antiviral effectors at the contact site with infected cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>).</p>

<caption><title>Proposed model of the innate responses associated with COVID-19 severity.</title>

(1) pDCs from <italic>Mild</italic> patients and <italic>healthy donors</italic> (in purple) robustly produce IFN-I/&#x03BB; upon cell contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (upper panel). (2) As opposed, pDCs from <italic>Severe</italic> patients (in red) produce IFN-I/&#x03BB; in absence of <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation, but fail to be activated by the contact to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (lower panel). (3) This non-responsive/exhausted state of pDCs in <italic>Severe</italic> COVID-19 patients is associated to an elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (here represented by IL6, red round symbols) that are most likely produced by the HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD14<sup>&#x002B;</sup> monocytes. (4) As shown on the zoomed view of the contact site (right panel, at the top), the short-range sensing of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells by pDCs requires cell contact mediated by adhesion complexes, identified as &#x03B1;<sub>L</sub>&#x03B2;<sub>2</sub> integrin and ICAM-1.

<title>pDCs critically control viral replication and the outcome of COVID-19 severity</title>
<p>Insights on several hallmarks of IFN-I/&#x03BB; pathway as being critical in COVID-19 severity are emanating from recent publications. First, neutralizing autoantibodies against several cytokines and genetic defects affecting the IFN-I pathway have been identified in life-threatening COVID-19, as autosomal disorders of IFN-I immunity and autoantibodies underlie at least 10&#x0025; of critical COVID-19 pneumonia cases<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></bold></sup>. Second, patients with severe diseases exhibit reduced circulating pDCs and low plasma IFN-I/&#x03BB; levels when compared to mild COVID-19 patients<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></bold></sup>. Third, IL-3, which increases innate immunity likely by promoting the recruitment of circulating pDCs into the airways, is reduced in the plasma of patients with high viral load and severity/mortality<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></bold></sup>. This evidence highlights that several biomarkers of IFN-I/&#x03BB; response are diminished in COVID-19 patients, and hereby points to pDCs as a primary candidate in the progression of COVID-19. Here, using an original approach to study innate immunity in <italic>ex vivo</italic>-stimulated PBMCs from COVID19 patients, we further report that the functionality of pDCs is markedly blunted in severe patients, as observed upon their stimulation by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells as well as other TLR agonists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>pDC effector functions against SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p>pDCs comprise distinct subpopulations capable of varied functions and efficacy levels to mount an IFN-I/&#x03BB; response<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></bold></sup>. Viral infections and attendant inflammation potentially impact the frequency and functionality of the distinct pDC subpopulation including effect on pDC renewal<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></bold></sup>. Such modulations could be imprinted either by the micro-environment <italic>via</italic> crosstalk with immune cells, or by pDC activation itself.</p>
<p>We now report that neither pDC subpopulation frequencies nor their distinct ability to respond to SARS-CoV-2 are impacted by stimulation and contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. This is notably illustrated for CD2<sup>low</sup>/CD2<sup>hi</sup> pDCs that display similar activation profile upon stimulation with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when comparing stimulations by contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells <italic>versus</italic> cell-free activators (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., viral particles and synthetic agonists), we found that the differentiation of pDCs defined by CD80 and/or PD-L1 expression are readily distinguishable depending on the TLR7 inducers. Whilst pDCs diversify towards all the different PD-L1/CD80 subsets upon cell-free stimulation (agonist and virus) in agreement with prior publications<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></bold></sup>, the contact with infected cells restricts their evolution to PD-L1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD80<sup>-</sup> subsets. Of note, previous reports suggested that PD-L1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD80<sup>-</sup> pDCs are more efficient for IFN-I response compared to the other subsets<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></bold></sup>.</p>
<p>In accordance with this phenotype, the contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected cells induces a IRF7/IFN-I/&#x03BB;-prioritized signaling in pDCs, while leaving inactive the NF-&#x03BA;B-mediated pathway. The &#x2018;bifurcated&#x2019; signaling in TLR7-activated pDCs can occur independently toward either IFN-I/&#x03BB; production or NF-&#x03BA;B activation leading to pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation markers. This bifurcation of signaling is expected to be dependent on the sub-cellular compartment in which the TLRs encounter activating signal: activation in early endosomes induces IFN-I while activation in endolysosomes triggers NF-&#x03BA;B-mediated signaling<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></bold></sup>. We previously reported that, in the context of other viral infections (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., Dengue, Chikungunya, Hepatitis C, Zika viruses), contact with infected cells similarly induced a IRF7/IFN-I/&#x03BB; prioritized signaling in activated pDCs, as opposed to incubation of pDCs with cell-free viruses<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></bold></sup>. Of note, we also show that stimulation of pDCs by cell-free SARS-CoV-2 supernatants induced the upregulation of some activation markers (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., HLA-DR, PD-L1), in accordance with other reports<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></bold></sup>, but elicited virtually no IFN-I/&#x03BB; response. We propose that the signaling downstream of TLR7, including the phosphorylation cascade might be impacted by cell polarity and physical contact with infected cells<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></bold></sup>. Further studies will aim at addressing this question.</p>

<title>Cross-regulation of immune responses</title>
<p>Progression to severe COVID-19 predominates in elderly patients, since advanced age is a factor suspected to aggravate disease progression and to weaken innate immunity, potentially including pDC responsiveness<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></bold></sup>. This is in accordance with the demographic analysis of our COVID-19 cohort, as the age-ranges were 63.5-year-old [interquartile of 48.0-73.0] and 40.5-year-old [24-57] for <italic>Severe</italic> and <italic>Mild</italic> patients, respectively. The patient history and genetic factors can also explain the differential ability of pDCs from patients to mount a response against SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, as illustrated by the heterogeneous immune responses of patients, with critical anomalies in functionality of pDC in severe COVID-19. Our kinetic analysis performed on a COVID-19 patient that presents auto-antibodies against IFN-I<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></bold></sup> shows that the responsiveness of their pDCs to stimulation by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells was blunted <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>)</bold>. A future study is needed to expand this interesting preliminary observation, which already indicates that the IFN-I/&#x03BB; response can reinforce via a positive feedforward regulation the pDC antiviral function.</p>
<p>Of note, comparison of responses across patients with different COVID-19 severities suggest that pDC response to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells inversely correlates with an exacerbated inflammatory response (as illustrated by IL6 production by monocytic cells) and a basal level of IFN-I/&#x03BB; and inflammation activity. It is tempting to speculate that the progressive enrichment of proinflammatory cytokines in the lung micro-environment can imprint pDC responsiveness. In this scenario, an excessive elicitation of pDCs would lead to their functional &#x2018;silencing&#x2019;. Future studies will be needed to elucidate the underlining mechanism that could lead to such &#x2018;<italic>exhausted</italic>&#x2019; pDCs, as reminiscent of the findings of impaired pDC function in a distinct infection context<sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></bold></sup>. In turn, the deficit of the antiviral control at the infected site owing to <italic>exhausted</italic> pDCs can then feedback as fuel for uncontrolled viral replication leading to more lung inflammation. Altogether our results thus highlight possible cross-regulation between immune cells in the course of COVID-19.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a still-ongoing worldwide health threat, currently causing a significant human and economic burden, being exacerbated by divergence into more severe variants. Here, we provide compelling evidence that pDCs are a key cell type in the initiation of antiviral responses against SARS-CoV-2. Further, this study identified the failure of pDC response as critical in COVID-19 severity. Moving forward our finding shall provide guidelines for predictive biomarkers, as associated with pDC responsiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infections and background IFN-I/&#x03BB; response at different stages of disease. Furthermore, strategies to boost the pDC response, and especially their recruitment to the lung, can lead to the development of potential therapeutics against pulmonary viral infections.</p>

Next, total RNA was eluted in 40 <italic>&#x00B5;</italic>L RNAse-free water and concentration was quantified by spectrophotometry using a NanoVue (Biochrom). Only 200 ng of RNA were needed to achieve IFN signature with Nanostring technology. For the Elements system, capture (probe A) and tag (probe B) probe DNA oligos were designed by NanoString and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). After hybridization at 67&#x00B0;C for 18-20 hours, samples were analyzed using the &#x201C;High Sensitivity&#x201D; protocol option on the nCounter Prep Station and counted on nCounter Digital Analyzer using maximal data resolution.

<p>For the quantification by flow cytometry analysis of the viral spread of the icSARS-CoV-2-mNG SARS-CoV-2 molecular clones from RFP<sup>-</sup> cells to RFP<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells (initially uninfected) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>) and for quantification of data from the live-imaging analysis using spinning-disk confocal microscopy analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref></bold>), the statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple comparisons of means.</p>
<p>The set of Figures was prepared using PRISM software.</p>
