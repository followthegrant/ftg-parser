<meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Since 23 March 2020, social distancing measures have been implemented in the UK to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to quantify and characterize non-household contact and to identify the effect of shielding and isolating on contact patterns.

Methods Through an online questionnaire, the CoCoNet study measured daily interactions and mobility of 5143 participants between 28 July and 14 August 2020. Negative binomial regression modelling identified participant characteristics associated with contact rates.

Results The mean rate of non-household contacts per person was 2.9 d-1. Participants attending a workplace (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 3.33, 95%CI 3.02 to 3.66), self-employed (aIRR 1.63, 95%CI 1.43 to 1.87) or working in healthcare (aIRR 5.10, 95%CI 4.29 to 6.10) reported significantly higher non-household contact rates than those working from home. Participants self-isolating as a precaution or following Test and Trace instructions had a lower non-household contact rate than those not self-isolating (aIRR 0.58, 95%CI 0.43 to 0.79). We found limited evidence that those shielding had reduced non-household contacts compared to non-shielders.

Conclusion The daily rate of non-household interactions remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, suggesting continued adherence to social distancing guidelines. Individuals attending a workplace in-person or employed as healthcare professionals were less likely to maintain social distance and had a higher non-household contact rate, possibly increasing their infection risk. Shielding and self-isolating individuals required greater support to enable them to follow the government guidelines and reduce non-household contact and therefore their risk of infection.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey to quantify and characterize non-household contact and to identify the effect of shielding and isolating on contact patterns.</p></div><div id="sec-2" class="subsection"><p id="p-3"><strong>Methods</strong> Through an online questionnaire, the CoCoNet study measured daily interactions and mobility of 5143 participants between 28 July and 14 August 2020. Negative binomial regression modelling identified participant characteristics associated with contact rates.</p></div><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><p id="p-4"><strong>Results</strong> The mean rate of non-household contacts per person was 2.9 d<sup>-1</sup>. Participants attending a workplace (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 3.33, 95%CI 3.02 to 3.66), self-employed (aIRR 1.63, 95%CI 1.43 to 1.87) or working in healthcare (aIRR 5.10, 95%CI 4.29 to 6.10) reported significantly higher non-household contact rates than those working from home. Participants self-isolating as a precaution or following Test and Trace instructions had a lower non-household contact rate than those not self-isolating (aIRR 0.58, 95%CI 0.43 to 0.79). We found limited evidence that those shielding had reduced non-household contacts compared to non-shielders.</p></div><div id="sec-4" class="subsection"><p id="p-5"><strong>Conclusion</strong> The daily rate of non-household interactions remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, suggesting continued adherence to social distancing guidelines. Individuals attending a workplace in-person or employed as healthcare professionals were less likely to maintain social distance and had a higher non-household contact rate, possibly increasing their infection risk. Shielding and self-isolating individuals required greater support to enable them to follow the government guidelines and reduce non-household contact and therefore their risk of infection.</p></div><div id="sec-5" class="subsection"><div id="sec-6" class="subsection"><p><strong>What is already known on this subject?</strong></p><ul class="list-unord " id="list-1"><li id="list-item-1"><p id="p-6">The introduction of social distancing guidelines in March 2020 reduced social contact rates in the UK.</p></li><li id="list-item-2"><p id="p-7">Evidence of low levels of adherence to self-isolation.</p></li></ul></div><div id="sec-7" class="subsection"><p><strong>What does this study add?</strong></p><ul class="list-unord " id="list-2"><li id="list-item-3"><p id="p-8">This study provides quantitative insight into the social mixing patterns in the UK at the beginning of the second wave of SARS-CoV2 infection.</p></li><li id="list-item-4"><p id="p-9">Healthcare professionals and individuals attending their workplace in-person were less able to follow social distancing guidelines and made more contact with people outside their household than those working from home.</p></li><li id="list-item-5"><p id="p-10">Shielding individuals did not make fewer non-household contacts than those not shielding.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-11">The authors have declared no competing interest.</p><h3>Funding Statement</h3><p id="p-12">JREB is supported by a Lancaster University Faculty of Health and Medicine doctoral scholarship.
