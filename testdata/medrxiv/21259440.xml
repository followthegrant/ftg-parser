<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Objectives</title>
<p>The Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours (VERDICT) is a non-invasive MRI technique that has shown promising results in clinical settings discriminating normal from malignant tissue and Gleason grade 3&#x002B;3 from 3&#x002B;4. However, VERDICT currently does not account for the inherent relaxation properties of the tissue, whose quantification could provide additional information and enhance its diagnostic power. The aim of this work is to introduce relaxation-VERDICT (rVERDICT) for prostate, a model for the joint estimation of diffusion-based parameters (e.g. the intracellular volume fraction, f<sub>ic</sub>) and relaxation times (e.g. T2) from a VERDICT MRI acquisition; and to evaluate its repeatability and diagnostic utility for differentiating Gleason grades 3 and 4.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>72 men with suspected prostate cancer (PCa) or undergoing active surveillance were recruited. All men underwent multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) and VERDICT MRI. Deep neural network was used for ultra-fast fitting of the rVERDICT parameters. 44 men underwent targeted biopsy, which enabled assessment of rVERDICT parameters in differentiating Gleason grades measured with accuracy, F1-score and Cohen&#x2019;s kappa of a convolutional neural network classifier. To assess the repeatability of the new model, five men were imaged twice.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>The rVERDICT intracellular volume fraction f<sub>ic</sub> discriminated between Gleason grades (5-class classification) with accuracy, F1-score and kappa 8, 7 and 3 percentage points higher than classic VERDICT, and 12, 13 and 24 percentage points higher than the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) from mp-MRI. Repeatability of rVERDICT parameters was high (R<sup>2</sup>=0.74&#x2013;0.99, coefficient of variation=1&#x0025;&#x2013;10&#x0025; and intraclass correlation coefficient=78&#x0025;-98&#x0025;). T2 values estimated with rVERDICT were not significantly different from those estimated with an independent multi-TE acquisition (p&#x003E;0.05). The deep neural network fitting approach provided stable fitting of all the rVERDICT parameters with dramatic reduction of the processing time (&#x223C;35 seconds <italic>vs</italic> &#x223C;15 minutes using classic VERDICT), enabling on-the-fly rVERDICT map generation.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The new rVERDICT allows for robust and ultra-fast microstructural estimation of diffusion and relaxation properties of PCa and enables Gleason scoring.</p></sec>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>As for many cancers, prostate cancer (PCa) definitive diagnosis relies on biopsies. This invasive procedure can have serious side effects, such as infection, bleeding and urinary retention, significantly impacting quality of life. Recent advances in medical imaging have played a key role in improving PCa detection. For instance, multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI), consisting of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging sequences has been incorporated into the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for PCa diagnosis.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) However, whilst mp-MRI has 90&#x0025; sensitivity for detection of significant cancer, it&#x2019;s specificity is moderate at 50&#x0025;;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) resulting in 1 in 2 men still needing to undergo an unnecessary biopsy.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) Significant cancer is generally defined by the presence of Gleason pattern 4 tumour within a biopsy. Reliably separating lesions on mp-MRI that contain Gleason pattern 4 disease from those with non-significant cancer (Gleason 3&#x002B;3) or no cancer remains an unmet clinical need.</p>
<p>To address this, microstructure imaging techniques based on diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) offer sensitivity and specificity to microstructure changes that correspond to different Gleason grades, well above the simple apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), conventionally acquired as part of standard mp-MRI protocols.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) For example, the Vascular, Extracellular and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours (VERDICT) technique(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) was one of the first non-invasive imaging techniques to show histological specificity both ex-vivo and in-vivo, as well as in preclinical and clinical studies.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) Preliminary results from the clinical trial INNOVATE(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) reveal that the VERDICT intracellular volume fraction (f<sub>ic</sub>) can discriminate between Gleason 3&#x002B;3 and 3&#x002B;4 lesions.</p>
<p>However, VERDICT is currently limited in estimating only diffusion parameters without accounting for the inherent relaxation properties of the tissue.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) This leads to questionable accuracy of microstructural parameters, which likely limits their sensitivity. In addition to the potential of diffusion parameters, relaxometry parameters such as T2 relaxation time have also shown capability to discriminate Gleason grades 3 and 4.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) Works exploiting joint relaxation-diffusion analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) (also in other organs, e.g. brain) have shown that these two types of parameters often contain complementary information.</p>
<p>In this work, we hypothesise that a unifying model capturing both relaxation and diffusion effects can enhance the accuracy of both parameters estimates and Gleason grade discrimination. We propose a new relaxation-VERDICT (rVERDICT) model to estimate jointly the diffusion and relaxation parameters in prostate. This work capitalizes on the VERDICT clinically feasible imaging protocol and exploits joint relaxation-diffusion analysis using machine learning. We demonstrate the benefits provided by rVERDICT comparing our results with the classic VERDICT and ADC from mp-MRI of the same patients.</p>

<title>Patient population and study design</title>
<p>72 men (median age, 64.8 years; range, 49.5&#x2013;79.6 years) were recruited and provided informed written consent. The inclusion criteria were the following: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) suspected PCa or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) undergoing active surveillance for known PCa. Exclusion criteria included: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) previous hormonal, radiation therapy or surgical treatment for PCa and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) biopsy within 6 months prior to the scan. All patients underwent mp-MRI in line with international guidelines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) on a 3T scanner (Achieva, Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) supplemented by VERDICT DW-MRI (the clinical DCE part of mp-MRI was performed last after the VERDICT MRI).</p>
<p>After the clinical mp-MRI and VERDICT DW-MRI, 44 participants underwent targeted transperineal template biopsy of their index lesion as clinically indicated. The mp-MRI was used to guide cognitive targeted template biopsy (performed by experienced urologists). Specialist genitourinary pathologists (A.F. and M.R) evaluated histological specimens stained with haematoxylin and eosin from the biopsy cores and assigned each biopsy core a Gleason grade.

For each combination, a separate b=0 image was acquired. For b&#x003C;100 s/mm<sup>2</sup> the number of averages (NAV) = 4 and for b &#x003E; 100 s/mm<sup>2</sup> NAV= 6; voxel size 1.3&#x00D7;1.3&#x00D7;5 mm; matrix size 176&#x00D7;176; average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) = 35; scan duration = 12 minutes 25 seconds.</p>

<p>The pre-processing pipeline included denoising of the raw DW-MRI data using MP-PCA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) as implemented within MrTrix3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) &#x2018;dwidenoise&#x2019;, and then correction for Gibbs ringing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) with custom code in MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, USA). To reduce possible artefacts caused by patient movement during scanning and eddy current distortions, we applied mutual-information rigid and affine registration using custom code in MATLAB.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c2">
<title>Classic VERDICT</title>
<p>The VERDICT model is the sum of three parametric models, each describing the DW-MRI signal in a separate population of water from one of the three compartments: S<sub>ic</sub> comes from intracellular water trapped inside cells (including epithelium), modelled as restricted diffusion in spheres of radius R and intra-sphere diffusivity D<sub>ic</sub> = 2 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/ms; S<sub>ees</sub> comes from extracellular-extravascular water adjacent to, but outside cells and blood vessels (including stroma and lumen), modelled as Gaussian isotropic diffusion with effective diffusivity D<sub>ees</sub> = 2 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/ms; and S<sub>vasc</sub> arises from water in blood undergoing microcirculation in the capillary network, modelled as randomly oriented sticks with intra-stick diffusivity D<sub>vasc</sub> = 8 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/ms. The total magnetic resonance signal for the multi-compartment VERDICT model is:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21259440v1_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where f<sub>i</sub> is the proportion of signal from water molecules in population i = vasc, ic or ees, <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>vasc</italic></sub> &#x002B; <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>ic</italic></sub> &#x002B; <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>ees</italic></sub> = 1 and <italic>S</italic><sub>0</sub> is the b=0 signal intensity. We refer to the original VERDICT work(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) for further details on the specific expressions for S<sub>vasc</sub>, S<sub>ic</sub> and S<sub>ees</sub>.</p>
<p>In classic VERDICT there are three free model parameters that are estimated by fitting equation [1] to DW-MRI data: f<sub>ees</sub>, f<sub>ic</sub>, R. The vascular signal fraction, f<sub>vasc</sub>, is computed as 1 &#x2013; f<sub>ic</sub> &#x2013; f<sub>ees</sub>, while a cellularity index is computed as f<sub>ic</sub>/R<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>The VERDICT model for prostate is based on a few assumptions about water diffusion in the prostate tissue. First, the model assumes there are three major tissue compartments that mostly contribute to the measured DW-MRI signal: intra-cellular, intra-vascular and extra-cellular/extra-vascular, which are fully impermeable to water (i.e. no water exchange between compartments). Moreover, the water diffusivity inside the cellular and vascular compartments are fixed to D<sub>ic</sub> = 2 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/ms and D<sub>vasc</sub> = 8 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/ms. Several previous studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) investigated the validity of these assumptions under the experimental conditions of the optimized DW-MRI acquisition for VERDICT in prostate.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)</p>
<p>One of the major limitations of the classic VERDICT formulation is that the signal fractions f<sub>i</sub> in equation [1] are T2 and T1 relaxation weighted signal fractions. Therefore, their values and interpretation in terms of volume fractions of corresponding tissue compartments can be biased by the unaccounted relaxation properties of the tissue. This occurs when the DW-MRI acquisition includes different echo times (TE) and repetition times (TR) for different diffusion-weighting b, as in the imaging protocol for VERDICT DW-MRI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c3">
<title>Relaxation-VERDICT</title>
<p>The new relaxation-VERDICT (rVERDICT) model parameterises the T2 relaxation of the intracellular compartment by T2<sub>ic</sub>, and that of vascular and extracellular/extravascular compartments by the same T2<sub>vasc/ees</sub>. We also include the T1 relaxation contribution from the whole tissue as a single pool to account for the effect of different TR values used in the VERDICT DW-MRI acquisition. Mathematically, the rVERDICT model is
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21259440v1_eqn2.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where we adopt the same terminology as classic VERDICT, but here the volume fraction parameters f<sup>0</sup><sub>i</sub>, where i=vasc,ic,ees, avoid the bias in the corresponding classic VERDICT parameters from MR relaxation tissue properties.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>)</p>
<p>In total, rVERDICT has eight free parameters that are estimated by fitting equation [2] to DW-MRI data: S<sub>0</sub>, T1, T2<sub>ic</sub>, T2<sub>vasc/ees</sub>, f<sup>0</sup><sub>ees</sub>, f<sup>0</sup><sub>ic</sub>, R and D<sub>ees</sub>. For rVERDICT, the same assumptions as classic VERDICT for prostate apply, with the additional assumptions about the MR relaxation tissue properties as reported above and based on currently available experimental evidence.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) Note that, unlike classic VERDICT, for rVERDICT we exploit the TE and TR dependence of the b=0 images for the T2 and T1 relaxation time estimation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c4">
<title>Model fitting with deep neural network (DNN)</title>
<p>We obtained quantitative maps from both classic VERDICT and rVERDICT by fitting respectively equation [1] and [2] to the VERDICT DW-MRI data, using the signal averaged across the three gradient directions. To obtain ultra-fast parameters estimation, we performed the fitting using a DNN comprised of three fully connected layers,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) trained on a large database of synthetic signals generated from each model with the addition of Rician noise corresponding to SNR = 35 (see Text S1 in Supplementary Material which reports further details).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c5">
<title>DNN model fitting assessment</title>
<p>We tested the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates of rVERDICT using numerical simulations (see Text S2 in Supplementary Material which reports further details). To validate further the T2 relaxation time estimates, we compared the estimated T2<sub>ic</sub> and T2<sub>vasc/ees</sub> with independent T2 estimation from a T2-relaxometry MRI acquisition on seven patients, using the same DNN for fitting, trained with a two-compartment model of T2 relaxation (see Text S3 Supplementary Material which reports further details). We compared the distribution of estimated T2 values from rVERDICT with those from the T2-relaxometry acquisition for all the voxels within the prostate volume, and the corresponding mean and variance values. Statistically significant differences were assessed by two-tail t-test.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>There were 37 cancer lesions in the investigated cohort (n=44). Median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 7.0 ng/mL (range, 1.0&#x2013;71.0 ng/mL), the median time between VERDICT MRI and biopsy was 66.9 days (range, 8&#x2013;167 days). Of the 37 cancer lesions, 6 were Gleason grade 3&#x002B;3, 18 were Gleason grade 3&#x002B;4, and 13 were Gleason grade 4&#x002B;3 or greater.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this work, we propose a new prostate model called relaxation-VERDICT (rVERDICT) that provides joint estimation of relaxation and diffusion parameters, such as the intracellular T2 relaxation time (T2<sub>ic</sub>) and the intracellular volume fraction (f<sub>ic</sub>). Our hypothesis is that a unifying model capturing both relaxation and diffusion effects would enhance the accuracy of model parameters estimation and consequently the Gleason grade discrimination. As prostate histological components differ between Gleason grades,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) we expect diffusion parameters, and in particular the f<sub>ic</sub> from classic VERDICT that correlates strongly with epithelial volume fraction,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) to provide high biologic specificity to Gleason grade. However, classic VERDICT can only achieve discrimination of Gleason 3&#x002B;3 from 3&#x002B;4.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) Gleason discrimination for higher scores like 3&#x002B;4 from &#x2265;4&#x002B;3 is also important, as 4&#x002B;3 cancers are associated with a three-fold increase in lethal PCa compared to 3&#x002B;4 cancers.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) Here we hypothesise that rVERDICT can compensate for any relaxation-induced bias that may be reducing the accuracy of classic VERDICT estimates, enabling more robust identification and discrimination of Gleason 4 components.</p>
<p>Our main results (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) support our hypotheses, showing that the new information obtained from rVERDICT enables discrimination of five Gleason grades, with accuracy and Cohen&#x2019;s kappa 8 and 3 percentage points higher than classic VERDICT, and 12 and 24 percentage points higher than the ADC from mp-MRI, respectively. Most importantly, on the previously unattainable classification of Gleason grade 3&#x002B;4 and 4&#x002B;3, rVERDICT achieved the highest precision and sensitivity (both &#x2265;80&#x0025;) compared to classic VERDICT and ADC from mp-MRI.</p>
<p>The clinical utility of rVERDICT is demonstrated by the repeatability and fitting performance results. The f<sub>ic</sub> from rVERDICT (f<sup>0</sup><sub>ic</sub>) achieved higher repeatability (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99; CV = 5&#x0025;) compared to classic VERDICT f<sub>ic</sub> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.83; CV = 27&#x0025;, as reported in(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>)), showing that we can achieve greater reproducibility by removing confounds through disentangling relaxation from diffusion parameters. Additionally, the fitting approach based on deep neural network provides precise and robust estimates for all the rVERDICT parameters with dramatic reduction of the processing time (&#x223C;35 seconds compared to &#x223C;15 minutes using the AMICO framework(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>)), enabling on-the-fly rVERDICT map generation. This is a critical point that further enables clinical translation of the technique.</p>
<p>A great advantage of rVERDICT is the possibility to obtain simultaneously diffusion and relaxation properties of prostate tissue using only a 12-minute DW-MRI acquisition. We showed that estimates of T2 and T1 relaxation times with rVERDICT match those from independent measurements and literature. The T1 relaxation estimates had lower values within tumour lesions than in benign tissue (mean 1576 vs 2754 ms, respectively, P=0.003), in line with estimates obtained using independent T1 measurements.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) The T2 relaxation estimates T2<sub>ic</sub> within tumours were similar for benign tissue (mean 61 vs 67 ms, respectively, P&#x003E;0.05) and T2<sub>vasc/ees</sub> within tumour lesions were lower than in benign tissue (mean 300 vs 383 ms, respectively, P=0.023), in agreement with literature.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) For seven patients in our cohort, we performed an independent multi-TE acquisition which allowed for a direct comparison of the estimated T2 values using the two methods. Results showed that the rVERDICT T2 values were not statistically different (P&#x003E;0.05) from the independent T2 measurements.</p>
<p>Although multi-TE acquisitions have the advantage of offering MR images with higher resolution and less artefacts compared to DW-MRI, diffusion-based techniques give us unique insight into microstructure. rVERDICT harnesses the information from both relaxation and diffusion to provide a holistic characterisation of the prostate. In addition to the intracellular volume fraction f<sup>0</sup><sub>ic</sub>, here we also showed that other rVERDICT parameters such as cellularity, f<sup>0</sup><sub>ees</sub>, D<sub>ees</sub> and T1 can offer complementary information to aid Gleason grade discrimination.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the potential of rVERDICT for improving PCa diagnosis, we present three example cases in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. The new information provided by rVERDICT maps can help improve the ability of identifying and distinguishing Gleason grades of PCa lesions in cases where both the ADC map and the high b-value DWI already show clear contrast (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>) and most importantly when these conventional measures provide ambiguous information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3c</xref>).</p>
<p>There are several opportunities for further improvement in future work. The analysis presented here was performed on retrospective data with an acquisition protocol optimised for classic VERDICT probing a limited range of TE and TR values. This mostly compromises the sensitivity to long T2 values (T2<sub>vasc/ees</sub>) and the reproducibility of measured T1 values. However, we have shown that our estimates are still in agreement with independent T2 and T1 measurements that cover a wider acquisition parameter space. Future work will explore optimization of the VERDICT MRI acquisition to explicitly account for T1 and long T2 relaxation times. Additionally, here we analysed only 44 patients for whom the biopsy results were available. This resulted in having limited and unbalanced different Gleason grades, hampering the possibility to examine differences in diagnostic performance (e.g. with comparison of areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve). However, we were still able to draw significant correlations and demonstrate the potential of rVERDICT. Further study will include rVERDICT analysis on larger cohorts. Finally, rVERDICT (as classic VERDICT) does not account for the effect of exchange and diffusion time dependence of water diffusivity,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) such as D<sub>ees</sub>. However, the diffusion time used in this study was between 22-36 ms, a range for which previous studies have shown negligible effects due to permeability and time dependence.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) Future work can explore the possibility to include these effects in the model and potentially estimate other tissue properties such as cell membrane permeability.</p>
<p>In conclusion rVERDICT together with machine learning allows for ultra-fast and robust microstructural estimation of diffusion and relaxation properties of prostate cancer. This enables classification of Gleason grades, potentially allowing the utilisation of rVERDICT for screening and avoidance of unnecessary biopsies and treatments.</p>

<title>RVERDICT model fitting with deep learning</title>
<p>We obtain quantitative rVERDICT maps by fitting equation [2] to the DW-MRI data acquired at different b values, TE and TR. Note that for classic VERDICT the signal is normalized by the b = 0 of each b shell, while in this work we do not analyse the normalized signal, but we rather exploit the TE and TR dependence of the b = 0 in each shell for improving the T2 and T1 relaxation time estimation.</p>
<sec id="s5a1a">
<title>Deep learning fitting for parameter estimation</title>
<p>To obtain ultra-fast and robust parameter estimation, we perform the fitting using a deep learning approach based on deep neural networks (DNN),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) using the &#x2018;MLPregressor&#x2019; implemented in Python scikit-learn 0.23 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">https://scikit-learn.org/stable/</ext-link>). The input of our DNN is a vector of DW-MRI signals for each b, TE and TR combinations (a total of 10 in this specific case). The DNN consists of three fully connected hidden layers with 150 neurons, each characterised by a linear matrix operation followed by element-wise rectified linear unit function (ReLU), and a final regression layer with the number of output neurons equal to the number of tissue parameters to be estimated (i.e. eight for rVERDICT). The DNN is optimised by backpropagating the mean squared error (MSE) between ground truth model parameters and DNN predictions. We perform the optimisation with the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) method(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) for 1000 epochs (adaptive learning rate with initial value of 0.001; one update per mini-batch of 100 voxels; early stopping to mitigate overfitting; and momentum = 0.9) on 100,000 synthetic DW-MRI signals (split into 80&#x0025; for training and 20&#x0025; for validation). We generate the synthetic DW-MRI signals using equation [2] with different values for the model parameters randomly chosen between biophysical plausible intervals: S<sub>0</sub> = [0, maximum b=0 intensity x 2], T1 = [10, 4000] ms, T2<sub>ic</sub> = [1, 150] ms, T2<sub>vasc/ees</sub> = [150, 800] ms, f<sub>ees</sub> and f<sup>0</sup><sub>ees</sub> = [0.01, 0.99], f<sub>ic</sub> and f<sup>0</sup><sub>ic</sub> = [0.01, 0.99], R = [0.01, 15] &#x03BC;m and D<sub>ees</sub> = [0.5, 3] &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/ms. We also add Rician noise corresponding to SNR = 35 to consider experimental noise effect. For the final parameter computation, we use the DNN at the epoch with minimum validation loss.</p>
<p>The creation of the training set and training of the DNN (to be done only once) took &#x223C;100 seconds (4 threads on Intel Core i7 processor at 2.4GHz). Prediction of the trained DNN for the whole unmasked DW-MRI dataset (&#x223C;5&#x00D7;10<sup>5</sup> voxels) took &#x223C;35 seconds, for each subject.</p>

<title>Assessment of rVERDICT estimates accuracy and precision</title>
<p>To assess the accuracy and precision of the DNN estimator for a complex model as rVERDICT we perform numerical simulations with known ground-truth. Specifically, we generate 4&#x005E;7 synthetic DW-MRI signals with equation [2] and all the possible combinations of the seven model parameters using four values linearly distributed in the same range as described in the previous section but fixing the S<sub>0</sub> = 1. First, we evaluate accuracy and precision in terms of bias and dispersion of the prediction compared to the known ground-truth. Then, for a given realistic choice of each of the seven model parameters: T1 = 2700 ms, T2<sub>ic</sub> = 70 ms, T2<sub>vasc/ees</sub> = 530 ms, f<sup>0</sup><sub>ees</sub> = 0.40, f<sup>0</sup><sub>ic</sub> = 0.40, R = 8 &#x03BC;m and D<sub>ees</sub> = 2 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/ms, we evaluate the impact of possible degeneracy and local minima by comparing the distribution of predicted model values for each of the chosen parameters with the known ground-truth, when the other six parameters were varied (i.e. 4&#x005E;6 different combinations).</p>
<p>As benchmark, we compare the performance of our DNN model with the more conventional non-linear least squares minimisation, as implemented in the &#x2018;nonlincon&#x2019; function in MATLAB, using a grid-search algorithm for the initial guess.</p>

<title>Assessment of rVERDICT estimates of multiple T2 relaxation times in prostate tissue</title>
<sec id="s5c1a">
<title>T2-relaxometry MRI acquisition</title>
<p>To additionally assess the performance of rVERDICT in estimating multiple T2 relaxation times in prostate, a multi-TE acquisition was also acquired for seven of these patients for an independent estimate of the multiple T2 relaxation times. The sequence consisted of a multi-echo spin-echo sequence with an echo spacing of 31.25 msec and TR = 8956 msec. The other imaging parameters were: number of echo times = 32; field of view (FOV) = 180&#x00D7;180 mm; acquired voxel size = 2&#x00D7;2&#x00D7;4 mm; scan duration = 5 minutes 50 seconds.</p>

<p>To provide an independent T2 estimation of the relaxation times T2<sub>ic</sub> and T2<sub>vasc/ees</sub> assumed in rVERDICT, we fit the following equation to the multi-TE data:

We added Rician noise with SNR = 25 to match experimental noise conditions. We compare the distribution of estimated T2 values estimated from rVERDICT and the multi-TE acquisition for all the voxels within the prostate volume, as well as corresponding mean and variance.</p>

<p>For the CNN model, we chose the SE-Res-Net(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) which gives the best performance with our data based on comparison with other networks architectures (ResNet, DenseNet). SE-ResNet combines ResNet with embedded &#x201C;Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)<italic>&#x201D;</italic> block that adaptively recalibrates feature response (flowchart in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> of main text).

<p>For the data imbalance, we used 5-fold cross-validation (with test size 20&#x0025;) with stratified randomized folds to preserve the percentage of samples for each class. For training, we crop the images selecting the ROIs&#x2019; bounding box to the same size 96&#x00D7;96 pixels and apply data augmentation using rigid transformation (affine and rotation). We train the network for 30 epochs with cross-entropy loss and Adam optimization (learning rate of 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>).</p>

<caption><p>Reproducibility of the rVERDICT parameters. a) Correlation plots for all the rVERDICT parameters in the scan/rescan study. The adjusted coefficient of determination R<sup>2</sup> and the intraclass correlation coefficient ICC are reported for each of them, together with the identity line. b) Bland-Altman plots of the difference between scan and re-scan versus the average for all the rVERDICT parameters. The coefficient of variation CV, computed as standard deviation over the mean, is reported for each of them, together with the average (straight red line) &#x00B1; 1.96 standard deviation (dashed red lines) of the difference. The solid black line represents the ideal condition of zero difference. The dimensional parameters are in &#x03BC;m (apparent cell radius R); &#x03BC;m<sup>-3</sup> (Cellularity); &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/ms (extracellular-extravascular apparent diffusivity Dees) and ms (T1, intracellular T2<sub>ic</sub> and vascular/extracellular-extravascular T2<sub>vasc/ees</sub>).</p></caption>

<caption><p>Accuracy and precision of model fitting. The mean (data points) and variance (error bars) of the prediction for DNN and conventional non-linear least squares optimization are plotted against the known ground truth from numerical simulations. The identity line is also plotted to aid appreciating the accuracy of the prediction from both methods (higher the accuracy, closer the mean prediction to the identity line). The variance of the prediction (error bars) is a good indicator of the precision of the estimation: smaller the variance, higher the precision.</p></caption>

<caption><p>Robustness of DNN estimation to degeneracy and spurious local minima. The probability density distribution of the estimates of the seven rVERDICT model parameters (S<sub>0</sub> was fixed to 1)are plotted for seven ground truth values (T1 = 2700 ms, T2<sub>ic</sub> = 70 ms, T2<sub>vasc/ees</sub> = 530 ms, f<sup>0</sup> =0.40, f<sup>0</sup><sub>ic</sub> = 0.40, R = 8 &#x03BC;m and D<sub>ees</sub> = 1.9 &#x03BC;m<sup>2</sup>/ms) and 4,096 different random combinations of the other parameters, for both DNN and conventional non-linear least squares optimisation. In absence of degeneracy and/or spurious local minima we would have very narrow distributions centred on the ground truth values. The wider the distribution, the less robust the estimation and the lower the precision due to degeneracy and/or spurious minima.</p></caption>
