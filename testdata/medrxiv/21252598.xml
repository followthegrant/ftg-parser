<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing worldwide, including in Japan. At the outbreak&#x2019;s beginning in Japan, many factors regarding the transmission route were unclear. However, since early March 2020, we have taken prompt measures in consideration of the probable airborne transmission route. Infection control within the Ultrasound Department is important to prevent hospital-related transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>The environmental factors that increase the risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 are now becoming clear, and knowledge about infection from asymptomatic individuals has been accumulated. Initially, close contact and respiratory droplets were suggested as the main transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Several studies have provided evidence for airborne transmission of viruses, showing that closed, crowded, and poorly ventilated environments contribute to viral transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Recently, airborne transmission has been pointed out as an important pathway for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Many research results have indicated that environmental ventilation is an important factor in protection against the spread of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Although ventilation equipment is generally designed according to the standards of modern hospitals, complex arrangements and small exam rooms can result in inadequate ventilation in practice. Considering this situation, the air quality of indoor environments should be emphasized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>To prevent nosocomial infection, it is particularly important to understand the ventilation situation in hospitals and to implement countermeasures against the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Therefore, we measured carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations in each exam room to assess the effect of subjects&#x2019; respiration on room air quality.</p>
<p>Because the examiner was present during the ultrasound examinations, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in each room reflects the respiration of both the subject and the examiner. Thus, we also measured the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the exam room when only the examiner was present for 10 minutes and compared the result to the situation when the subject was also present.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in cases of infants and children aged less than 10 years, a single attendant was present during the examinations, and the observed concentration values are attributable to the respirations of all individuals present.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>In this study, we measured the CO2 concentration in the exam rooms in the absence of the patient. No information that identifies the individual patient was used.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Institutional Review Board of the National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center determined that no ethical review was necessary because the study did not involve human subjects.</p>
<p>Our ultrasound center consists of 9 small exam rooms, which are separated by fixed partitions with little space above the partitions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Our ultrasound center consists of 9 small exam rooms, which are separated by fixed partitions with little space above the partitions. Each exam room had an area of 12&#x2013;15 m<sup>2</sup>.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="21252598v1_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Each exam room is equipped with air intake and exhaust vents connected to the central ventilation system that was originally installed in each room, which meets the ventilation standards of the Japanese Building Code.</p>
<p>All of these exam rooms and the hospital&#x2019;s facilities meet Japanese legal environmental standards; however, no evaluation of individual exam room air quality was conducted under actual clinical conditions. The subjects were 70 cases (abdomen: 24, breast: 16, neck: 16, and musculoskeletal (MSK): 14). In the cases of infants and children (abdomen: 6 and musculoskeletal: 6), one attendant accompanied the patient during the examination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in each exam room before and after the ultrasound examinations. Changes in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration over time were investigated at multiple time points after completion of the exams.</p>
<p>Measurements were conducted using a multifunctional portable air quality tester (WYZXR Air Quality Monitor, Multifunctional Indoor Pollution Detector Meter). The air quality tester was positioned in the flat part of the ultrasound machine, just between the subject and the examiner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="21252598v1_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The height of the air quality tester was 120 cm from the floor, the room temperature was 22&#x2013;24&#x00B0;C and the humidity was 40%&#x2013;45%. Each exam room had an area of 12&#x2013;15 m<sup>2</sup>. All of the exam room doors were kept open and ventilated when ultrasound examinations were not being performed.</p>
<p>After the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was measured before each examination, the ultrasound examination was performed with the door closed. After the examination, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was measured at 0&#x2013;15 minutes (0, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 15 minutes) after the end of the exam. One minute after the end of the examination, the door of the exam room was opened to allow air exchange with the aisle.</p>
<p>For statistical analysis, Bonferroni/Dunn multiple comparison tests were used, with a significance level of p&#x003C;0.005.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The average duration of each examination was 10.3&#x00B1;5.6 minutes (3&#x2013;26 minutes). There were no differences in examination time between body sites.</p>
<p>The highest observed CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was 2261 ppm, which was observed after breast examination. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was significantly higher in breast examinations than other examinations at all time points after the examination (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)</p>

<p>In the case of the examiner being alone in the room, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were unchanged throughout all time phases, with a maximum of 103% of the pre-test value (immediately after the end of the test).</p>

<sec id="s5">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we measured the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in ultrasound exam rooms with the aim of evaluating the ventilation in ultrasound rooms under real clinical conditions.</p>
<p>The results show that CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were elevated by breast examinations and the presence of an attendant in pediatric cases. In contrast, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations remained low during neck examinations compared with those of all other areas.</p>
<p>A possible reason for the lack of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations is that the subjects did not vocalize during the neck examinations. In contrast, in breast and pediatric cases, the examiner needs to talk to the patient or attendant to understand the lesion&#x2019;s location and symptoms, possibly influencing the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Examinations of the abdomen, which require repeated inhalation/exhalation during the test, showed lower CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations than those of the mammary gland, suggesting that CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may be elevated by vocalization and speech.</p>
<p>The observed changes in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration over time suggest that air conditions would not recover to their pre-exam state for about 15 minutes in the absence of forced ventilation, suggesting that mechanical ventilation or a circulator to create air flow would be desirable.</p>
<p>The current study has several limitations: it is a study of a single facility and a specific environment, and more precision-controlled methods are required for a rigorous assessment of air quality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We measured CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations before and after testing in relatively small ultrasound rooms and examined the concentration ratios and changes over time.</p>
<p>Even at a hospital with modern ventilation equipment, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the ultrasonic exam room rises immediately after the examination, and it takes at least 15 minutes to recover to the approximate concentration observed before the examination. In ultrasonographic facilities, care must be taken to ensure adequate ventilation.</p>
