<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the emergence of COVID-19, excess mortality from all causes has been low in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Actually, data obtained throughout Japan show 12 and 104 cases of excess mortality in August and October, 2020. These very few cases of excess mortality in Japan might be attributable to the lower number of traffic accidents from voluntary restrictions against going out.</p>
<p>However, countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak such as lockdowns or voluntary restrictions against going out can cause stress and can suppress economic activity. Countermeasures might lower incomes or cause job loss. Such economic stress might lead to suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Such difficulties should be counted as part of the costs for countermeasures. Therefore, the present study examined excess mortality attributable to suicide caused by COVID-19.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<label>2.</label>
<title>Method</title>
<p>The estimation procedure was almost identical to that used for an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], except for some points. Excess mortality was defined as the difference between the actual number of deaths and an epidemiological threshold if the actual number of deaths exceeded an epidemiological threshold. The epidemiological threshold is defined as the upper bound of the 95&#x0025; confidence interval (CI) of the baseline. The baseline is defined as the number of deaths that are likely to have occurred if an influenza outbreak had not occurred. Therefore, if the actual deaths were fewer than the epidemiological threshold, then excess mortality was not inferred. Additionally, we defined negative excess mortality as the difference between the actual number of deaths and the lower bound of 95&#x0025; CI if the actual deaths were fewer than the lower bound of 95&#x0025; CI.</p>
<p>Data used for this study were those of monthly deaths from all causes, as reported from 2005 through September 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. The NIID model, the Stochastic Frontier Estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], is presented as

</disp-formula>
and
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21251670v1_eqn2.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> represents suicide deaths in month/year <italic>t, T</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> denotes the linear time trend, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is a dummy variable for routine pneumococcal vaccination, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is a dummy variable for effect of the great earthquake in eastern Japan in March, 2011, and <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> is a dummy variable for the month. Also, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> takes a value of one after October, 2014; otherwise, it is zero. Similarly, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> takes a value of one in May, June, or July in 2011; otherwise, it is zero. <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> is one if <italic>t</italic> is the <italic>i-</italic>th month; otherwise, it is zero. Moreover, &#x03BD;<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> and &#x03C9;<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> are stochastic variables as &#x03BD;<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> <italic>&#x223C;N</italic>(<italic>0, &#x03BC;</italic><sup>2</sup>) and &#x03C9;<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> <italic>&#x223C;N</italic>(<italic>0,&#x03BE;</italic><sup>2</sup>); they are mutually independent. Although &#x03BD;<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> represents stochastic disturbances, &#x03C9;<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> denotes non-negative deaths attributable to influenza. These disturbance terms in this model are parameterized by two parameters: &#x03BE;/<italic>&#x03BC;</italic> and (<italic>&#x03BC;</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><italic>&#x002B;&#x03BE;</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>)<sup><italic>0</italic>.<italic>5</italic></sup>. If the null hypothesis <italic>&#x03BE;</italic>/&#x03BC;=0 is not rejected, then the Stochastic Frontier Estimation model is inappropriate.</p>
<p>The study area encompassed the entire nation of Japan. The study period for estimation was October 2009 through September 2020 because of data availability. Suicide is defined as X60-X84 in ICD10. We adopted 5&#x0025; as the level at which significance was inferred for results.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> presents observed suicide deaths, the estimated baseline, and its threshold for males. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows corresponding data for females. These figures showed that males are more numerous than females, but consistently decline is noted in the period for both genders. The sharpest spike occurred around May 2011, probably because of the great earthquake that struck eastern Japan on March 11, 2011. More than two months passed after the event before suicide increased. The second sharpest increase occurred probably in the latest period.</p>

<p>Because the estimated coefficients of the cross-term of routine vaccination initiation and time trend, earthquake dummy, and the cross-term of ICD10 revision and time trend were not found to be significant, we dropped these terms from the estimation equation (1). <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents estimation results without these variables. The estimated coefficients of the great earthquake in eastern Japan were 0.133 for males and 0.247 for females. That result implies that the numbers of suicide deaths jumped respectively by 13&#x0025; and 25&#x0025; because of the earthquake. It is noteworthy that the effect on females was greater than on males, although the incidence of suicide death was much greater among males than among females.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study applied the NIID model to suicide deaths to detect excess mortality attributable to COVID-19. Results showed that significant excess mortality attributable to suicide was found in July to September 2020, especially in August. It was estimated as 810 for both genders. Females were infected more by the COVID-19 outbreak than males, although the number of suicide deaths among males has been usually much greater than among females.</p>
<p>As described earlier, some excess mortality was found for August and October, 2020, respectively, as 12 and 104 cases. At least 12 cases of excess mortality among all causes in August might result from 304 cases of excess mortality attributable to suicide. At the same time, pneumonia deaths were recorded respectively as 178, 314, and 75 cases of negative excess mortality, in May, June, and July. Those figures were measured as the gap separating the observation and lower bound of 95&#x0025; CI for baseline if the former was lower than the latter in May, June, and July [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. In August, negative excess mortality attributable to pneumonia was not found, although the observation was below the baseline. Therefore, excess mortality attributable to suicide was cancelled out partially by negative excess mortality attributable to pneumonia. Therefore, no excess mortality was found for all causes of death. However, in August, negative excess mortality attributable to pneumonia was less than before. Therefore, excess mortality in suicide led to overall excess mortality for all causes, even though it was a very small number. In this sense, excess mortality attributable to suicide might be large in October, although data were not available because excess mortality from all causes was reported as a larger number than in August.</p>
<p>Throughout Japan, about 592 cases of mortality attributable to COVID-19 in July August and September 2020, as confirmed by PCR testing, were reported to the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) officially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Therefore, excess mortality caused by suicide was 1.4 times greater than that reported for COVID-19 death. Pneumonia deaths sometimes lead to negative excess mortality. Therefore, the target of countermeasures for COVID-19 should reduce excess mortality attributable to suicide, at least in Japan. In other words, economic activity should be less restricted if there are fewer infection opportunities.</p>
<p>Some researchers in Japan have emphasized considerable excess mortality from all causes of death through October of around 19 thousand at maximum due to COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] when using the Farrington algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and EuroMOMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], which was 11 times larger than the number of death confirmed by PCR test. This study measured excess mortality as the gap separating observations and baseline, not a threshold, as in prefectures where observations were higher than the threshold Therefore, their estimated too huge excess mortality might seriously mislead people into adopting greater risks of infection by COVID-19 among the general population.</p>
<p>The present study has some limitations. First, our results reflect data obtained through September, 2020 when the COVID-19 outbreak was not so widespread. Subsequently, and especially in winter, a severer COVID-19 outbreak occurred. The second state of emergency was declared on January 7, 2021. It required shortened business hours for restaurants. In the first state of emergency declaration in April and May, 2020, restaurants were required to shut down. Even though requirements of the second state of emergency were milder than the first, it might have increased suicide deaths several months after. Continuous monitoring is expected to be necessary.</p>
<p>Second, to ascertain the most appropriate countermeasures for COVID-19 in Japan, cost-effectiveness analysis is necessary. At that time, loss of quality of life in should be counted among the costs of restriction of economic activity as a major part of countermeasures. It remains as a subject for our next research challenge.</p>
</sec>

<label>5.</label>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The obtained results show excess mortality in suicide in July, August and September, 2020. Continued careful monitoring of excess mortality attributable to suicide is expected to be necessary for evaluating countermeasures taken for the second state of emergency declaration.</p>
