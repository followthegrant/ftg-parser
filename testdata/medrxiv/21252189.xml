<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>At the moment we have more than 109 million cases and 2.4 million deaths around the world and vaccination represents the only hope to control the pandemic. Imperfections in planning vaccine acquisition and difficulties in implementing distribution among the population, however, have hampered the control of the virus so far.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We propose a new mathematical model to estimate the impact of vaccination delay against COVID-19 on the number of cases and deaths by the disease in Brazil. We apply the model to Brazil as a whole and to the State of Sao Paulo, the most affected by COVID-19 in Brazil. We simulated the model for the populations of the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole, varying the scenarios related to vaccine efficacy and compliance from the populations.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>The model projects that, in the absence of vaccination, almost 170 thousand deaths and more than 350 thousand deaths until the end of 2021 for Sao Paulo and Brazil, respectively. If in contrast, Sao Paulo and Brazil had enough vaccine supply and so started a vaccination campaign in January with the maximum vaccination rate, compliance and efficacy, they could have averted more than 112 thousand deaths and 127 thousand deaths, respectively. In addition, that for each month of delay the number of deaths increases monotonically in a logarithm fashion, for both the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our model shows that the current delay in the vaccination schedules that is observed in many countries has serious consequences in terms of mortality by the disease and should serve as an alert to health authorities to speed the process up such that the highest number of people to be immunized is reached in the shortest period of time.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the world struggles to implement vaccination schemes against SARS-CoV-2, limited production of doses, imperfections in planning vaccine acquisition and difficulties in implementing distribution among the population, have hampered the control of the virus so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. As of 18 February 2021, 188 million people have been vaccinated around the world, which represents less than 3&#x0025; of the total. In Brazil, the total number of vaccinated people so far is, around 2.5&#x0025; of the target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The world vaccination rate currently is less than 4 million doses per day, a very timid rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Soit is no surprise that vaccination by itself has had so far little effect on the number of cases and deaths that continues to soar in many countries. At the moment we have more than 109 million cases and 2.4 million deaths around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Although previous pandemics have demonstrated that pharmaceutical interventions are less important than non-pharmaceutical intervention in controlling the infection, there is a growing body of evidences that this will not be the case with the vaccines against COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Immediately after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China, many laboratories around the world started the development of more than 100 types of different vaccines, short-circuiting in less than one year the usual time frame of new vaccines development and testing, which normally would be around ten years, a remarkable tour of force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>There is a wide range of covid-19 vaccines being developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. As of February 2021, there are 80 vaccine candidates in 212 clinical trials and 11 vaccines approved by at least one country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].Of these, 80 vaccines are in the pipeline, of which 20 are in Phase 3 of clinical trials (four have already completed this phase) and 37in Phase 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In the US, three vaccines completed Phase 3 trials, namely, Moderna, Pfizer, and Oxford-AstraZeneca, and two are still in Phase 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>However, in order to have significant impact on the course of the pandemic, safe and effective vaccines have to emerge in less time that it would take the affected populations to reach natural herd immunity because to wait to have herd natural immunity would be disastrous. Therefore, an unprecedented time-schedule to roll out any effective vaccine is urgently needed. Nevertheless, in many countries the vaccination is limited to certain individual groups and the distribution of enough doses for these individuals is very slow. We have at the moment only 188 million doses applied in 64 countries around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Brazil has accumulated almost 10 million cases and more than 240 thousand deaths at the time of writing (18 February 2021) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. The state of Sao Paulo, the most populous in Brazil reported almost 2 million cases and 57 thousand deaths so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Notwithstanding the fact that Brazil is the third country with the highest number of cases and second with the highest number of deaths in the world, only two vaccines, Coronavac and Oxford-AstraZeneca have been licensed. Currently, just above 2&#x0025; of the target population have received a first dose of one or the other vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>This paper proposes a new model to estimate the impact of vaccination delay against Covid-19 on the number of cases and deaths by the disease in Brazil. We apply the model to Brazil as a whole and to the State of Sao Paulo, the most affected by COVID-19 in Brazil. This work is a theoretical exercise because it assumes that at every time of the pandemic there is enough vaccine, which is not realistic for the majority of countries.</p>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>The model</title>
<p>The model is an extension of the one presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] and has the following variables:</p>

<p>We simulated model (1) with the parameters as in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> for the two populations of the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole, varying the scenarios related to vaccine efficacy and compliance from the populations. We simulated efficacy with values of 50&#x0025;, 70&#x0025; and 90&#x0025; and compliance with values of 50&#x0025;, 70&#x0025; and 80&#x0025;. As mentioned above, we simulated the scenarios for Brazil as a whole and for the State of S&#x00E3;o Paulo. As shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, we have chosen values of vaccination rates that varied from 0.005 days<sup>-1</sup> until 0.1 days<sup>-1</sup>. This implies that the time taken to reach herd immunity varied from 16 years to about 9 months, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>We fitted the model parameters simultaneously to the data of cumulative number of reported cases and deaths (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>) for Brazil until December 18, 2020. The fitting procedure is described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].To estimate a 95&#x0025; probability interval (shaded area in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>), we assumed a normal distribution for the contact rate with a standard deviation of 1.0&#x0025;.</p>

<p>It can be noted from <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> that, in the absence of vaccination, the model projects almost 170 thousand deaths and more than 350 thousand deaths until the end of 2021 for Sao Paulo and Brazil, respectively. If in contrast, Sao Paulo and Brazil had enough vaccine supply and so started a vaccination campaign in January with the maximum vaccination rate, compliance and efficacy, they could have averted more than 112 thousand deaths and 127 thousand deaths, respectively.</p>
<p>In <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref> we show the number of additional deaths attributable to vaccination delay. It can be seen that for each month of delay the number of deaths increases monotonically (in a logarithm fashion) for both the State of Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we present a theoretical exercise, represented by a model intended to estimate the impact of (perhaps inevitable) delay in starting vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, illustrated with the epidemic situation in Brazil and in the State of Sao Paulo. The model parameters are calibrated from reports of daily COVID-19 infections, as well as published reports and it reproduces the real data with remarkable accuracy. Our results demonstrate that, both for Brazil as a whole and for the State of Sao Paulo, for each month of delaying the starting of vaccination, the number of deaths to COVID-19 is staggering high.</p>
<p>We assumed vaccination rates that simulates immunization of up to 70&#x0025; of the whole country in 9 months, which may seem unfeasible but Brazil has a long tradition in mass vaccination campaigns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], managing to immunize more than 20 million people in a single day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Therefore, the maximum vaccination scenario would be a real possibility, given the country experience in mass vaccination schedules adopted in the past. However, due to difficulties in vaccine acquisition, the number of available doses so far has been very low indeed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. At the time of writing, Brazil has vaccinated slightly above 2&#x0025; of its population, way below the target of at least 70&#x0025; to achieve the assumed herd immunity level.</p>
<p>The model has some important limitations worth mentioning, the most important is perhaps that it does not consider age-dependence in incidence of the infection and in the mortality rates. However, the model was intended to simulate a mass vaccination campaign that would include all age strata in a relatively short period of time. In addition, we considered only the original variant of the virus, which means that our results represent a lower bound in the number of cases and deaths due to vaccination delay. The current scenario of the pandemic, in which new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are emerging in some countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] should be considered in the simulation of future vaccination models, but there is not enough empirical evidence of the impact of these new variants as related to the vaccine efficacy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our model shows that the current delay in the vaccination schedules, that is observed in many countries, has serious consequences in terms of mortality by the disease and should serve as an alert to health authorities to speed the process up such that the highest number of people to be immunized is reached in the shortest period of time.</p>
