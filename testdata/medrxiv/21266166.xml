<p>We estimate the potential remaining COVID-19 burden in 19 European countries by estimating the proportion of each country&#x2019;s population that has acquired immunity to severe disease through infection or vaccination. Our results suggest that many European countries could still face a substantial burden of hospitalisations and deaths, particularly those with lower vaccine coverage, less historical transmission, and/or older populations. Continued non-pharmaceutical interventions and efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage are required in these countries to limit severe COVID-19 outcomes.</p>

<sec id="s1">
<p>Although many European countries have experienced high burdens of COVID-19 and have been able to vaccinate a large proportion of their inhabitants, there is considerable variation in historical burden between countries and therefore in the proportion of their populations with naturally-acquired immunity. In addition, the pace of vaccination has slowed recently in many countries and uptake in younger age groups has been lower than in older age groups. Coupled with the emergence of the more transmissible Delta variant and its AY.4.2 sub-lineage, which currently available vaccines are less effective against, this leaves the potential for a considerable remaining burden of COVID-19 for many countries. Furthermore, the question of when COVID-19 will transition from being epidemic to endemic has recently arisen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). A functional definition for the start of the transition to endemicity is the point at which everyone in the population has either been infected or vaccinated. To provide insight into these issues we estimate the proportion of the population that is both unvaccinated and unexposed and introduce a metric to quantify and compare the potential remaining burden of COVID-19 across countries, accounting for variation in historical burden, vaccine effectiveness and population age structure between countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Determinants of remaining burden</title>
<p>The potential remaining COVID-19 burden in a country depends on several factors, but the key determinants are: (i) the proportion of each age group in the population with naturally-acquired immunity, (ii) the proportion of each age group with vaccine-induced immunity, and (iii) the age structure of the population, which determines the population-level risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalisation/death). Estimating the level of naturally-acquired immunity in the population from case incidence data is difficult due to variation in reporting levels over the course of the pandemic and across countries. With reliably reported death time series and high-quality estimates of the infection fatality rate (IFR), infection time series can in principle be inferred by deconvolving the death time series and scaling it by the inverse of the IFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). However, since vaccination reduces the risk of death given SARS-CoV-2 infection and most countries have followed an age-based vaccine rollout, the IFR for COVID-19 has varied asynchronously between age groups over time, and this needs to be accounted for in the calculation. We therefore use age-stratified death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) and vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) data to infer age-stratified infection time series, accounting for the impact of vaccination on the IFR for each age group over time.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Vaccination and the infection fatality rate</title>
<p>COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to offer strong protection against disease, hospitalisation and death, but weaker protection against infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Their efficacy against different outcomes also varies according to vaccine type, dose and virus variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Thus, as vaccination coverage has increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), the overall IFR has decreased, but in a way that depends on the speed and composition of the vaccine rollout (by age and vaccine product) and the changing proportions of different SARS-CoV-2 variants. We account for the varying impacts of vaccination on different disease outcomes by estimating the overall time-varying IFR for each age group for each country as a weighted average of the IFR for unvaccinated individuals and that for vaccinated individuals, averaging the efficacies of different vaccine types and doses against different outcomes for the different circulating variants according to their relative proportions in each country (see Supplement). This gives the overall country-level IFRs shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>. The pattern of decrease in the IFR is similar for most countries in Europe, except England and Romania, where respectively earlier and slower vaccine rollouts have led to earlier and slower declines, and the overall pre-vaccination IFR was higher (close to 1&#x0025; vs an average of 0.8&#x0025;) for countries with older populations, such as Italy and Portugal.</p>

<title>Historical burden and naturally-acquired immunity</title>
<p>Using the age- and time-dependent IFR for each country (Supplementary Figure S1) we infer age-stratified infection time series from age-stratified death time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) for each country (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), and from these calculate the cumulative proportion of (unvaccinated and vaccinated) individuals who have been infected and therefore have some degree of immunity. We make the simplifying assumption that naturally-acquired and vaccine-induced immunity do not wane, given the relatively slow waning of immunity suggested by current evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), and assume complete cross-protection between different variants, given limited observation of immune escape for the Alpha and Delta variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). We find considerable variation in the estimated proportion of the population with naturally-acquired immunity between countries, ranging from 3.0&#x0025; (95&#x0025; credible interval (CI) 2.0-5.2&#x0025;) in Norway over the whole population to 70&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI 61-84&#x0025;) in Romania.</p>

<title>Vaccine-induced immunity and breakthrough infections</title>
<p>To calculate the proportion of the population with immunity acquired through infection or vaccination, <italic>or both</italic>, it is necessary to estimate the proportion of infections that are breakthrough infections, i.e. among vaccinees, to avoid double counting these individuals when tallying the overall number with immunity. Assuming that vaccine-induced immunity, like naturally-acquired immunity, wanes slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and that vaccine rollout occurred sufficiently early and quickly in most European countries that the number of vaccinated individuals rapidly dominated the number previously infected, the proportion of infections that are breakthrough infections can be approximated via the relationship between vaccine efficacy against infection and the proportion of infections amongst vaccinated individuals from the &#x201C;screening method&#x201D; for calculating vaccine efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) (see Supplement). This approach suggests that in many countries there are very few or no individuals in older age groups (40&#x002B;yrs) who are both unvaccinated and unexposed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), and that the majority of unexposed unvaccinated individuals are in younger age groups (&#x003C;40yrs), with the overall proportion of unvaccinated and unexposed individuals varying from 0&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI 0-1&#x0025;) in Hungary to 31&#x0025; (95&#x0025; CI 8-34&#x0025;) in Slovenia.</p>

<title>Remaining hospitalisations and deaths</title>
<p>Having estimated the remaining number of unvaccinated and unexposed individuals in each age group in each country, we calculate the potential remaining COVID-19 burden as the number of hospitalisations/deaths that would occur per 100,000 individuals if the entire population were to be (re-)exposed now (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In other words, the burden if all unexposed and unvaccinated individuals were infected and a proportion of vaccinated individuals and previously infected individuals were infected dependent on the protection against infection afforded by vaccination/previous infection. This corresponds to the maximum potential short-term burden of hospitalisations and deaths as it does not account for waning of immunity, population growth or potential emergence of immune escape variants, and assumes that vaccine coverage, the infection hospitalisation rate (IHR) and the IFR stay at their current levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Figure S1).</p>
<p>The estimated maximum overall remaining hospitalisations per 100,000 individuals ranges widely across countries, from 62 (95&#x0025; CI 58-67) in England to 840 (95&#x0025; CI 760-920) in Romania (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This reflects the combination of high vaccine coverage and high prior levels of exposure in England and the low vaccine coverage, particularly among older individuals, in Romania than other countries (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In absolute terms, the estimated maximum number of remaining hospitalisations ranges from 6,300 (95&#x0025; CI 5,500-7,700) for Denmark to 280,000 (95&#x0025; CI 260,000-310,000) for Germany. The comparative pattern of maximum remaining COVID-19 deaths across countries is similar (Supplementary Figure S3), given the strong influence of age on the IFR as well as the IHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), with the burden of deaths per 100,000 people ranging from 19 (95&#x0025; CI 18-20) for England to 360 (95&#x0025; CI 330-380) for Romania, and absolute numbers of deaths ranging from 1,200 (95&#x0025; CI 1,000-1,400) for Slovenia to 115,000 (95&#x0025; CI 104,000-129,000) for Germany. Aside from Romania, where vaccine coverage is low, countries with a combination of lower vaccine coverage among older age groups, relatively low prior exposure and older populations (Austria, Finland, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Slovenia) have the highest maximum remaining burdens (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and Supplementary Figure S4), as they have the potential to experience much higher numbers of hospitalisations and deaths among the elderly than countries with younger populations and high coverage in older age groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5">
<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>Our results suggest that the potential remaining burden of COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths across the 19 European countries considered is substantial, amounting to over 900,000 hospitalisations and 300,000 deaths, and that it varies considerably between countries, with countries that have experienced less transmission so far, have lower vaccine coverage and/or have older populations having much higher potential outstanding burdens. These estimates represent an upper bound on the short-term burden that could theoretically occur from a complete lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions and return to pre-pandemic contact levels. We do not consider longer-term burden, as this would depend on the impact of waning immunity on severe disease, which remains to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), and would also be influenced by susceptible individuals being replenished through births. Continued non-pharmaceutical interventions and efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage are therefore required in the short term in these countries to limit severe COVID-19 outcomes. Exactly how transmission dynamics evolve in different countries in the longer term will depend on local policies, and this will be explored through more detailed modelling building on this analysis.</p>
