<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To date, excess mortality has mainly been used to assess the social effects of influenza activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. However, since the emergence of COVID-19, excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 has been attracting attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] as a measure of the total effects of the disease because it can reflect cases which have not been identified as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive. Especially in Japan, PCR tests administered per capita have been few. Therefore, concern has arisen about the possibility that some deaths caused by COVID-19 have not been recognized heretofore. Moreover, excess mortality related to COVID-19 might be expected to contribute to evaluation of vaccine effects. For these evaluations, the estimated excess mortality without the effects of a vaccine should be regarded as a baseline. Nevertheless, no such a trial has been undertaken to date. This study might be the first trial to measure that figure in Japan.</p>
<p>As of the end of June, 2021, the COVID-19 outbreak showed about 800 thousand patients and about 15 thousand deaths from the outbreak have been reported in Japan. Although Japan has about one third of the population of the U.S., these figures are vastly different in scale from those of the U.S., which has reported 33.5 million cases of morbidity and 600 thousand cases of mortality (deaths) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In light of the much lower number of patients in Japan, some criticism has arisen that low PCR testing rates might have led to the lower number of documented patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. In this sense, one might regard the number of deaths as reflecting the actual situation in Japan, but with no testing-related bias.</p>
<p>Concerning deaths, the case-fatality rate (CFR) is about 5&#x0025;. In fact, the CFRs in both countries are not much different. The lower PCR testing in Japan might be related to some problems. Therefore, we specifically examined excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 in Japan, irrespective of the cause of death.</p>
<p>In Japan, excess mortality was estimated using the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], which has been the official procedure for more than ten years. It was applied to two data sources: the national monthly deaths of all causes and the respective weekly pneumonia and influenza deaths in the 21 largest cities and their total. The latter is published regularly in Japanese during the influenza season as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/ja/flu-m/2112-idsc/jinsoku/131-flu-jinsoku.html">https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/ja/flu-m/2112-idsc/jinsoku/131-flu-jinsoku.html</ext-link>. Unfortunately, that publication ceased in March 2020 because it is intended for influenza. The first peak in Japan was April 3, 2020[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]: excess mortality cannot be detected until March. Instead, we applied NIID model to the all causes of death in the whole of Japan to evaluate impact of the outbreak of COVID-19.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Excess mortality is defined as the difference between the actual number of deaths and an epidemiological threshold. The epidemiological threshold is defined as the upper bound of the 95&#x0025; confidence interval (CI) of the baseline. The baseline is defined as the number of deaths that are likely to have occurred if an influenza outbreak had not occurred. Therefore, if the actual deaths are fewer than the epidemiological threshold, then excess mortality is not inferred.</p>
<p>The data used for this study were monthly deaths of all causes from 1987 through May 2021[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. NIID model, the Stochastic Frontier Estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], is presented as

</disp-formula>
where <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> represents all causes of death in month/year <italic>t, T</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> denotes the linear time trend, and <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>it</italic></sub> is the dummy variable for a month, which is one if <italic>t</italic> is the <italic>i-</italic>th month and otherwise zero. Moreover, <italic>&#x03BD;</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> and <italic>&#x03C9;</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> are stochastic variables as <italic>&#x03BD;</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> &#x223C;<italic>N</italic>(<italic>0, &#x03BC;</italic><sup>2</sup>) and <italic>&#x03C9;</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> &#x223C;<italic>N</italic>(<italic>0,&#x03BE;</italic><sup>2</sup>); they are mutually independent. Although <italic>&#x03BD;</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> represents stochastic disturbances, <italic>&#x03C9;</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> denotes non-negative deaths attributable to influenza. These disturbance terms in this model are parameterized by two parameters: <italic>&#x03BE;</italic>/<italic>&#x03BC;</italic> and (<italic>&#x03BC;</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x002B;<italic>&#x03BE;</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>)<sup><italic>0</italic>.<italic>5</italic></sup>. If the null hypothesis <italic>&#x03BE;</italic>/<italic>&#x03BC;</italic>=0 is not rejected, then the Stochastic Frontier Estimation model is inappropriate.</p>
<p>Study areas were the whole of Japan and its capital, Tokyo. Study period foe estimation was from 1987 to May 2021 for the whole of Japan and up through March, 2021 for Tokyo. We adopted 5&#x0025; as significant level.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study applied the NIID model to all causes of death to detect excess mortality attributable to COVID-19. We found 376 excess mortality in August and October, 2020, and in May, 2021.</p>
<p>Moreover, we found 1323 excess mortality in Tokyo. It may not be a few excess mortality. Until January, 2021. Tokyo had 861 deaths due to COVID-19 confirmed PCR test. It means that excess motility was larger than confirmed death due to COVID-19. It may imply that some mortality due to COVID-19 were not captured as COVID-19 death, because all death was not tested by PCR. Or, outbreak of COVID-19 may increase suicide in Japan probably because of too restriction to business such as restaurant or sightseeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. The amount of excess mortality in Tokyo may imply that such an indirect effect of COVID-19 outbreak might be larger than COVID-19 death confirmed by PCR test.</p>
<p>It might be increasing after September, especially in winter, even though excess mortality in the whole of Japan were very few at least until May, 2021.</p>
<p>On the other hand, about 10200 mortality cases caused by COVID-19 confirmed by PCR testing, were reported in MHLW officially as of May, 2021 throughout Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Therefore, even if COVID-19 actually caused external mortality, neither the NIID model nor another statistical model might would detect significant effects attributable to COVID-19. Of course, some deaths from COVID-19 might not have been tested and might have been excluded from these official numbers of mortality cases. However, total deaths might include deaths without diagnosis as COVID-19, but actually those associated with COVID-19. Estimation results suggest that such unrecognized deaths associated with COVID-19 are not significant, even if they exist.</p>
<p>Some researchers in Japan have emphasized considerable excess mortality from all causes of death through March, 2021 of around 28.6 thousand at maximum due to COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] using the Farrington algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] and EuroMOMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], which was more than three times larger than the number of death confirmed by PCR test until March, 2021, 9113. Their study measured excess mortalities as the gap between observation and beeline, not threshold as, in prefectures where observation was higher than threshold. Therefore, their estimated too huge excess mortality may seriously mislead the risk participation for COVID-19 among the general population. In particular, in Tokyo, they found 2219 excess mortality until January, 2021. It was more than 2.5 times higher than PCR confirmed death in Tokyo, 861.</p>
<p>At the same time, they also found approximately 57.6 thousands negative excess mortality in Japan until March, 2021 and 3679 negative excess mortality in Tokyo until March, 2021. Conversely, we found only 3 persons as negative excess mortality in February, 2020, and 751 negative excess mortality in March, 2020, in the whole of Japan, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Such a huge negative excess mortality may doubt validity of their procedures. Their estimated baseline might be upward biased. It probably suggested that their adopted procedure have upper biased for excess mortality comparison with NIID model, which was suggested logically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Moreover, they used only five years to estimate and thus volatility in data might be too small to obtain more appropriate threshold.</p>
<p>Using pneumonia death data instead of total death data might be better to evaluate excess mortality caused by COVID-19. However, application rule of the International Classification of Diseases was revised on January 2017, after which pneumonia deaths decreased by approximately 25&#x0025;. April 2020 was the fourth April since that of 2017. However, excess mortality in pneumonia death should be our next challenge.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We found substantial excess mortality since the outbreak of COVID-19 had emerged in Tokyo between August and October and December. It might be increasing rapidly in winter season. Conversely, we found few excess mortality in the whole of Japan. It should be important to continue to monitor excess mortality of COVID-19 carefully hereafter.</p>
