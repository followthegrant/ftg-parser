<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Academic researchers, government agencies, industry groups, and individuals have produced forecasts at an unprecedented scale during the COVID-19 pandemic. To leverage these forecasts, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) partnered with an academic research lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to create the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Launched in April 2020, the Forecast Hub is a dataset with point and probabilistic forecasts of incident hospitalizations, incident cases, incident deaths, and cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 at national, state, and county levels in the United States. Included forecasts represent a variety of modeling approaches, data sources, and assumptions regarding the spread of COVID-19. The goal of this dataset is to establish a standardized and comparable set of short-term forecasts from modeling teams. These data can be used to develop ensemble models, communicate forecasts to the public, create visualizations, compare models, and inform policies regarding COVID-19 mitigation. These open-source data are available via download from GitHub, through an online API, and through R packages.</p>

<title>Background &#x0026; Summary</title>
<p>To understand how the COVID-19 pandemic would progress in the United States, dozens of academic research groups, government agencies, industry groups, and individuals produced probabilistic forecasts for COVID-19 outcomes starting in March 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> We have collected forecasts from over 82 modeling teams in a data repository, thus making forecasts easily accessible for COVID-19 response efforts and forecast evaluation. The data repository is called the United States (US) COVID-19 Forecast Hub (hereafter, Forecast Hub) and was created through a partnership between the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and an academic research lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>
<p>The Forecast Hub was launched in early April 2020 and contains real-time forecasts of reported COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. As of September 8, 2021, the Forecast Hub had collected nearly 65 million individual point or quantile predictions contained within over 4,600 submitted forecast files from over 100 unique models. The forecasts submitted each week reflected a variety of forecasting approaches, data sources, and underlying assumptions. There were no restrictions in place regarding the underlying information or code used to generate real-time forecasts. Each week, the latest forecasts were combined into an ensemble forecast (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and all recent forecast data were updated on an official COVID-19 Forecasting page hosted by the US CDC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> The ensemble models were also used in the weekly reports that are posted on the Forecast Hub website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19forecasthub.org/doc/reports/">https://covid19forecasthub.org/doc/reports/</ext-link>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Forecasts are quantitative predictions about future observations. Forecasts differ from scenario-based projections, which examine feasible outcomes conditional on a variety of future assumptions. Because forecasts are unconditional estimates of future observations, they can be evaluated. An important feature of the Forecast Hub is that submitted forecasts are time-stamped so that the exact time at which a forecast was made public can be verified. In this way, the Forecast Hub serves as a public, independent registration system for these forecast model outputs. Data from the Forecast Hub have served as the basis for research articles for forecast evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and forecast combination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> These studies can be used to determine how well models have performed at various points during the pandemic, which can, in turn, guide best practices for utilizing forecasts in practice and inform future forecasting efforts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Any modeling team was eligible to submit forecast data to the Forecast Hub, provided they submitted data in the correct format. Teams submitted predictions in a structured format to facilitate data validation, storage, and analysis. Teams also submitted a metadata file and license for their model&#x2019;s data. Forecast data, ground truth data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> New York Times (NYTimes),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and USA Facts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> as well as model metadata were stored in the public Forecast Hub GitHub repository.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The forecasts were automatically synchronized with an online database called Zoltar via calls to a REpresentational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> every six hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Forecast data may be downloaded directly from GitHub, via the <italic>covidHubUtils</italic> R package,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> the zoltr R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> or zoltpy python library.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup></p>

<p>This dataset of real-time forecasts created during the COVID-19 pandemic can provide insights into the shortcomings and successes of predictions and improve forecasting efforts in years to come. Though these data are restricted to forecasts for COVID-19 in the United States, the structure of this dataset has been used to create datasets of COVID-19 forecasts in the EU and the UK, and longer-term scenario projections in the US.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> The general structure of this data collection could be applied to additional diseases or forecasting outcome in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>This large collaborative effort has provided data on short-term forecasts for over a year of forecasting efforts. These data were collected in real-time and therefore are not subject to retrospective biases. The data are also openly available to the public, thus fostering a transparent, open science approach to support public health efforts.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Data Acquisition</title>
<p>Beginning in April of 2020, the Reich Lab at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in partnership with the CDC, began collecting probabilistic forecasts of key COVID-19 outcomes in the United States (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The effort began by collecting forecasts of deaths and hospitalizations at the weekly and daily scale for the 50 US states, Washington DC, and 4 territories (Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands) as well as the aggregated US national level. In July 2020, the effort expanded to include forecasts of weekly incident cases at the county, state, and national levels. Forecasts may include a point prediction and/or quantiles of a predictive distribution.</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 1:</label>
<caption><p>Forecast characteristics for all four outcomes. The table shows the temporal scale, spatial scale of locations, horizons stored, number of quantiles, and the dates of the earliest forecast, earliest standardized truth data, and the earliest ensemble build.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="21265886v1_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Any team was eligible to submit data to the Forecast Hub. Upon initial submission of forecast data, teams were required to upload a metadata file that briefly described the methods used to create the forecasts and specified a license under which their forecast data were released. No model code was stored by the Forecast Hub.</p>
<p>During the first month of operation, members of the Forecast Hub team downloaded forecasts made available by teams publicly online, transformed these into the correct format, and pushed them into the Forecast Hub repository. Starting in May 2020, all teams were required to format and submit their own forecasts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Repository structure</title>
<p>The dataset is stored in two locations, and all data can be accessed through either source. The first is the COVID-19 Forecast Hub GitHub repository and the second is an online database, Zoltar, which can be accessed via a REST API.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Details about data format and access are documented in the subsequent sections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Zoltar: data backend</title>
<p>The data can be accessed through the Zoltar forecast repository REST API. Through the API, subsets of submitted forecasts can be queried directly from a PostgreSQL database. This eliminates the need to access individual CSV files and facilitates access to versions of forecasts in cases when they are updated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Outcomes and locations</title>
<p>The Forecast Hub dataset stores forecasts for four different outcomes: incident hospitalizations, incident cases, incident deaths, and cumulative deaths (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Incident hospitalizations can be submitted for a horizons of 1 - 130 days in the future, incident cases can be submitted for 1 - 8 weeks in the future, and incident and cumulative deaths can be submitted for 1 - 20 weeks into the future. For all outcomes, forecasts can be submitted on a national and state level. Incident case forecasts were first introduced as a forecast outcome several months after the Hub started and have several key differences with other predicted outcomes. They are the only outcome for which the Hub accepts county-level forecasts in addition to the state and national level. Because there are over 3,000 counties in the US, this required some compromises on the scale of data collected for these forecasts in other ways. Specifically, case forecasts are required to have fewer quantiles (seven quantiles) compared to other outcomes which can have up to twenty-three quantiles. This gives a coarser representation of the forecast (see the section on Forecast format below).</p>
<p>Weekly targets follow the standard of epidemiological weeks (EW) used by the CDC, which defines a week to start on a Sunday and end on the following Saturday.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Forecasts of cumulative deaths target the number of cumulative deaths reported by the Saturday ending a given week. Forecasts of weekly incident cases or deaths target the difference between reported cumulative cases or deaths on consecutive Saturdays. As an example of a forecast and the corresponding observation, forecasts submitted between Tuesday, October 6, 2020 (day 3 of EW41) and Monday, October 12, 2020 (day 2 of EW42) contained a &#x201C;1 week ahead&#x201D; forecast of incident deaths that corresponded to the change in cumulative reported deaths observed in EW42 (i.e., the difference between the cumulative reported deaths on Saturday, October 17, 2020, and Saturday, October 10, 2020), a &#x201C;2 week ahead&#x201D; forecast that corresponded to the change in cumulative reported deaths in week EW43. In this paper, we refer to the &#x201C;forecast week&#x201D; of a submitted forecast as the week corresponding to a &#x201C;0-week ahead&#x201D; horizon. In the example above, the forecast week would be EW41. Daily incident hospitalization horizons are for the number of reported hospitalizations a specified number of days after the forecast was generated.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Forecast assumptions</title>
<p>Forecasters used a variety of assumptions to build models and generate predictions. Forecasting approaches include statistical or machine learning models, mechanistic models incorporating disease transmission dynamics, and combinations of multiple approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Teams have also included varying assumptions regarding future changes in policies and physical distancing measures, the transmissibility of COVID-19, vaccination rates, and the spread of new virus variants throughout the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Weekly submissions</title>
<p>A forecast submission consists of a single comma-separated value (CSV) file submitted via pull request to the GitHub repository. Forecast submissions are validated for technical accuracy and formatting (see exclusion criteriabelow) before being merged. To be included in the weekly ensemble model, teams were required to submit their forecast on Sunday or prior to a deadline on Monday. The majority of teams contributing to the dataset submitted forecasts to the Hub repository on Sunday or Monday, although some teams submitted at other times depending on their model production schedule.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Model designation</title>
<p>Each model stored in the repository must have a classification of &#x201C;primary&#x201D;, &#x201C;secondary&#x201D; &#x201C;other&#x201D;. Each team must only have one &#x201C;primary&#x201D; model. Teams submitting multiple models with similar forecasting approaches can use the designations &#x201C;secondary&#x201D; or &#x201C;other&#x201D; for their models. Models with the designation &#x201C;primary&#x201D; are included in evaluations, the weekly ensemble, and the visualization. The &#x201C;secondary&#x201D; label is designed for models that have a substantive methodological difference than a team&#x2019;s &#x201C;primary&#x201D; model. Models with the designation &#x201C;secondary&#x201D; are included only in the weekly ensemble and the visualization. The &#x201C;other&#x201D; label is designed for models that are small variations on a team&#x2019;s &#x201C;primary&#x201D; model. Models with the designation &#x201C;other&#x201D; are not included in evaluations, the ensemble build, or the visualization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Ensemble and baseline forecasts</title>
<p>Several models have a special status, either as a baseline or as an ensemble that combines multiple models from the Hub to create a single forecast.</p>
<p>The COVIDhub-baseline model was created by the Hub in May 2020 as a benchmarking model. Its point forecast is the most recent observed value as of the forecast creation date with a probability distribution around that based on weekly differences in previous observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> The baseline model initially produced forecasts for case and death outcomes. Hospitalization baseline forecasts were added in September 2021.</p>
<p>The COVIDhub-ensemble model creates a combination of submitted forecasts to the Hub. Other work details the methods used for determining the appropriate combination approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> Starting in February 2021, GitHub tags were created to document the exact version of the repository used each week to create the COVIDhub-ensemble forecast. This creates an auditable trail in the repository so the correct version of the used forecasts could be recovered even in cases when some forecasts were subsequently updated.</p>
<p>Several other models also are combinations of some or all models submitted to the Forecast Hub. As of August 1, 2021, these models are COVIDhub-trained_ensemble, FDANIHASU-Sweight, JHUAPL-SLPHospEns, and KITmetricslab-select_ensemble. These models are flagged in the metadata using the Boolean metadata field, &#x201C;ensemble_of_hub_models&#x201D;.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2i">
<title>Exclusion criteria</title>
<p>No forecasts were excluded from the dataset due to the forecast values or the background experience of the forecasters. Forecast files were only rejected if they did not meet the automatic formatting criteria implemented through automatic GitHub checks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> These included checks to ensure that, among other criteria:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A forecast file is submitted no more than 2 days after it has been created (to ensure forecasts submitted were truly prospective). The creation date is based on the date in the filename created by the submitting team.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The forecast dates in the content of the file are in the format YYYY-MM-DD and match the creation date.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Quantile forecasts do not contain any quantiles at probability levels other than those required (see Forecast Format section below).</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="s2j">
<title>Updates to files</title>
<p>To ensure that forecasting is done in real-time, all forecasts are required to be submitted to the Hub within 2 days of the forecast date, which is listed in a column within each forecast file. Though occasional late submissions were accepted up through January of 2021, the policy was updated to not accept late forecasts due to missed deadlines, updated modeling methods, or other reasons.</p>
<p>Exceptions to this policy were made if there were programing or data errors that affected the forecasts in the original submission or if a new team joined. If there was an error, teams were required to submit a comment with their updated submission affirming that there was a bug and that the forecast was only produced using data that were available at the time of the original submission. In the case of updates to forecast data, both the old and updated versions of the forecasts can be accessed either through the GitHub commit history or through time-stamped queries of the forecasts in the Zoltar database. Note that an updated forecast can include &#x201C;retracting&#x201D; a particular set of predictions in the case when an initial forecast was not able to be updated. When new teams join the Hub, they can submit late forecasts if they can provide publicly available evidence that the forecasts were made in real-time (e.g. GitHub commit history).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2k">
<title>Ground truth data</title>
<p>Data from the JHU CSSE dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> are used as the ground truth data for reported cases and deaths. Data from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://HealthData.gov">HealthData.gov</ext-link> system for state-level hospitalizations are used for the hospitalization outcome. JHU CSSE obtained counts of cases and deaths by collecting and aggregating reports from state and local health departments. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://HealthData.gov">HealthData.gov</ext-link> contains reports of hospitalizations assembled by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Teams were encouraged to use these sources to build models. Although hospitalization forecasts were collected starting in March 2020, the hospitalizations data from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://HealthData.gov">HealthData.gov</ext-link> were only available later, and we started encouraging teams to target these data in November 2020. Some teams used alternate data sources including the NYTimes, USAFacts, US Census data, and other signals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Versions of truth data from JHU CSSE, USAFacts, and the NYTimes are stored in the GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Previous reports of ground truth data for past time points were occasionally updated as new records became available, definitions of reportable cases, deaths, or hospitalizations changed, or errors in data collection were identified and corrected. These revisions to the data are sometimes quite substantial, and for some purposes such as retrospective ensemble construction, it is necessary to use the data that would have been available in real-time. The historically versioned data can be accessed either through GitHub commit records, data versions released on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://HealthData.gov">HealthData.gov</ext-link>, or third-party tools such as the covidcast API provided by the Delphi group at Carnegie Mellon University or the <italic>covidData</italic> R package.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup></p>

<title>Summary of forecast data collected</title>
<p>In the initial weeks of submission, there were fewer than 10 models providing forecasts. As the pandemic spread, the number of teams submitting forecasts increased to 82; as of July 2021, 82 primary, 4 secondary models and 15 models with the designation &#x201C;other&#x201D; had been submitted to the Forecast Hub. In the first six months of 2021, a median of 35.5 teams (range: 30 to 38) contributed incident case forecasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>), a median of 12 teams (range: 9 to 14) contributed incident hospitalizations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>), a median of 43 teams (range 37 to 49) contributed incident death forecasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref>), and a median of 44 teams (range 34 to 46) contributed cumulative death forecasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3d</xref>). As of September 8 2021, the dataset contained 4,602 forecast files with 64,902,239 point or quantile predictions for unique combinations of targets and locations.</p>

<title>GitHub repository data structure</title>
<p>Forecasts in the GitHub repository are available in subfolders organized by model. Folders are named with a team name and model name, and each folder includes a metadata file and forecast files. Forecast CSV files are named using the format &#x201C;&#x003C;YYYY-MM-DD&#x003E;-&#x003C;team abbreviation&#x003E;-&#x003C;model abbreviation&#x003E;.csv&#x201D;. In these files, each row contains data for a single outcome, location, horizon, and point or quantile prediction as described above.</p>
<p>The metadata file for each team, named using the format &#x201C;metadata-&#x003C;team abbreviation&#x003E;-&#x003C;model abbreviation&#x003E;.txt&#x201D;, contains relevant information about the team and the model that the team is using to generate forecasts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Forecast format</title>
<p>Forecasts were required to be submitted in the format of point predictions and/or quantile predictions. Point predictions represented single &#x201C;best&#x201D; predictions with no uncertainty, typically representing a mean or median prediction from the model. Quantile predictions are an efficient format for storing predictive distributions of a wide range of outcomes.</p>
<p>Quantile representations of predictive distributions lend themselves to natural computations of, for example, pinball loss or a weighted interval score, both strictly proper scoring rules that can be used to evaluate forecasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> However, they do not capture the structure of the tails of the predictive distribution beyond the reported quantiles. Also, the quantile format does not preserve any information on correlation structures between different outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>Variable descriptions</title>
<p>The forecast data in this dataset are stored in seven columns:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><bold>forecast_date</bold> - the date the forecast was made in the format YYYY-MM-DD.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>target</bold> - a character string giving the number of days/weeks ahead that are being forecasted (horizon) and the outcome. Horizons must be one of the following:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>&#x201C;N wk ahead cum death&#x201D; where N is a number between 1 and 20</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x201C;N wk ahead inc death&#x201D; where N is a number between 1 and 20</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x201C;N wk ahead inc case&#x201D; where N is a number between 1 and 8</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x201C;N day ahead inc hosp&#x201D; where N is a number between 0 and 130</p></list-item></list></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>target_end_date</bold> - a character string representing the date for the forecast target in the format YYYY-MM-DD. For &#x201C;k day-ahead&#x201D; targets, target_end_date will be k days after forecast_date. For &#x201C;k week ahead&#x201D; targets, target_end_date will be the Saturday at the end of the specified epidemic week, as described above.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>location</bold> - character string of Federal Information Processing Standard Publication (FIPS) codes identifying U.S. states, counties, territories, and districts as well as &#x201C;US&#x201D; for national forecasts. The values for the FIPS codes are available in a CSV file in the repository and as a data object in the <italic>covidHubUtils</italic> R package for convenience.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>type</bold> - character value of &#x201C;point&#x201D; or &#x201C;quantile&#x201D; indicating whether the row corresponds to a point forecast or a quantile forecast.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>quantile</bold> - the probability level for a quantile forecast. For death and hospitalization forecasts, forecasters can submit quantiles at 23 probability levels: 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, &#x2026;, 0.95, 0.975, 0.99. For cases, teams can submit up to 7 quantiles at levels .025, 0.100, 0.250, 0.5, 0.750, 0.900 and 0.975. If the forecast &#x201C;type&#x201D; is equal to &#x201C;point&#x201D;, the value in the quantile column is equal to &#x201C;NA&#x201D;.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>value</bold> - non-negative numbers indicating the &#x201C;point&#x201D; or &#x201C;quantile&#x201D; prediction for the row. For a &#x201C;point&#x201D; prediction, value is simply the value of that point prediction for the target and location associated with that row. For a &#x201C;quantile&#x201D; prediction, the model predicts that the eventual observation will be less than this value with the probability given by the quantile probability level.</p></list-item></list>

<sec id="s3e">
<title>Metadata format</title>
<p>Each team documents their model information in a metadata file which is required along with the first forecast submission. Each team is asked to record their model&#x2019;s design and assumptions, the model contributors, the team&#x2019;s website, information regarding the team&#x2019;s data sources, and a brief model description. Teams may update their metadata file periodically to keep track of minor changes to a model.</p>

<list-item><p><bold>model_name</bold> - the name of the model (less than 50 characters).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>model_abbr</bold> - an abbreviated and uniquely identified name for the model that is less than 30 alphanumeric characters. The model abbreviation must be in the format of &#x2018;[team_abbr]-[model_abbr]&#x2019; where each of the &#x2018;[team_abbr]&#x2019; and &#x2018;[model_abbr]&#x2019; are text strings that are each less than 15 alphanumeric characters that do not include a hyphen or whitespace.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>model_contributors</bold> - a list of all individuals involved in the forecasting effort, affiliations, and email addresses.

<title>Technical Validation</title>
<p>Two similar but distinct validation processes were used to validate data on the GitHub repository and on Zoltar.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>GitHub repository</title>
<p>Validations were set up using GitHub Actions to manage continuous integration and automated data checking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Teams submitted their metadata files and forecasts through pull requests on GitHub. Each time a new pull request was submitted, a validation script ran on all new or updated files in the pull request to test for their validity. Separate checks ran on metadata file changes and forecast data file changes.</p>
<p>The metadata file for each team was required to be in valid YAML format, and a set of specific checks were required before a new metadata file could be merged into the repository. Checks included ensuring that the proposed team and model names do not conflict with existing names, that a valid license for data reuse is specified, and that a valid model designation was present. A list of specific validations for metadata may be found in Supplement 2.</p>
<p>New or changed forecast data files for each team were required to pass a series of checks for data formatting and validity. These checks also ensured that the forecast data files did not meet any of the exclusion criteria (see the Methods section for specific rules). Furthermore, a list of specific validations for forecast data files is provided in Supplement 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Zoltar</title>
<p>When a new forecast file is uploaded to Zoltar, unit tests are run on the file to make sure that forecast elements contain valid structure. (For a detailed specification of the structure of forecast elements, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.zoltardata.com/validation/">https://docs.zoltardata.com/validation/</ext-link>.) If a forecast file does not pass all unit tests, the upload will fail and the forecast file will not be added to the database; only when all tests pass will the new forecast be added to Zoltar. The validations in place on GitHub ensure that only valid forecasts will be uploaded to Zoltar.</p>
