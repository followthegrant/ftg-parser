<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Early detection has proven to be the most effective strategy to reduce the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). Nevertheless, most current screening programs suffer from low participation rates. A blood test may improve both the adherence to screening and the selection to colonoscopy. In this study, we conducted a serum-based discovery and validation of cfDNA methylation biomarkers for CRC screening in a multicentre cohort of 453 serum samples including healthy controls, benign pathologies, advanced adenomas (AA), and CRC. First, we performed an epigenome-wide methylation analysis with the MethylationEPIC array using a sample pooling approach, followed by a robust prioritization of candidate biomarkers for the detection of advanced neoplasia (AN: AA and CRC). Then, candidate biomarkers were validated by pyrosequencing in independent individual cfDNA samples. We report <italic>GALNT9, UPF3A, WARS</italic>, and <italic>LDB2</italic> as new non-invasive biomarkers for the early detection of AN. The combination of <italic>GALNT9/UPF3A</italic> by logistic regression discriminated AN with 78.8&#x0025; sensitivity and 100&#x0025; specificity, outperforming the commonly used fecal immunochemical test and the methylated <italic>SEPT9</italic> blood test. Overall, our results suggest that the combination methylated <italic>GALNT9/UPF3A</italic> has the potential to serve as a highly specific and sensitive blood-based test for screening and early detection of CRC.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third cancer with the highest incidence worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Diagnosis at advanced symptomatic stages is responsible for low survival (14&#x0025; for stage IV) compared to 90&#x0025; five-year survival for stage I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). A recent decrease in CRC-related mortality and incidence has been reported, mainly due to the implementation of screening programs that enable early detection of preclinical CRC and the removal of precancerous colorectal adenomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Despite strong evidence supports the reduction of both CRC incidence and mortality related to screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), the overall participation rate in stool-based screening programs using the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) followed by a confirmatory colonoscopy remains modest (49.5&#x0025; in Europe and 43.8&#x0025; worldwide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Since the effectiveness of a screening test relies not only on the diagnostic performance of the test but also on its acceptance by the target population, test preference for CRC screening has been evaluated. A survey-based study reported as first choice a blood test over a stool one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>); similarly, among screening-enrolled individuals who refused colonoscopy, 83&#x0025; preferred a non-invasive blood-based test, 15&#x0025; chose a fecal test and 3&#x0025; refused any test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Therefore, participation in screening programs could significantly improve by offering a non-invasive blood-based test.</p>
<p>Liquid biopsy has emerged as a non-invasive alternative to traditional procedures for sampling. Blood-based screening has the advantage of being easily available, repeatable, and minimally invasive for the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can be detected in body fluids and has been proposed as a source of liquid biopsy biomarkers as it reflects alterations occurring during neoplastic transformation, such as aberrant methylation in colorectal carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Recent epigenome-wide methylation analyses have reported that alterations in DNA methylation arise during the early stages of tumor progression and that the heterogeneity of the different pathways to CRC is already detectable in colorectal adenomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip array has proven to be reliable and consistent for DNA methylation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), and its combination with sample pooling represents a particularly suitable strategy for the cost-effective analysis of large sample sets aiming to discover differentially methylated signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). In this study, following a cfDNA pooling strategy, we aimed to identify non-invasive methylation biomarkers for the early detection of both colorectal cancer and advanced precancerous lesions. Here we report the discovery and independent validation of novel serum-based methylation biomarkers that could be implemented in CRC screening programs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>The study was conducted in three phases: (i) a high-throughput discovery analysis, paired with a statistically robust biomarker prioritization, was performed to identify candidate non-invasive methylation biomarkers for CRC screening, using a sample pooling strategy. Next, targeted assays were designed and optimized for the quantification of the candidate biomarkers in an independent cohort of patients (individual serum samples). The targeted analysis was divided into (ii) a preliminary evaluation and feature selection of the candidate biomarkers, and (iii) a subsequent validation and final statistical model construction based on the selected biomarkers. An overview of the study design is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. A description of the independent cohorts is presented in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Sample pooling</title>
<p>A total of 28 cfDNA pooled samples were used in the epigenome-wide methylation analysis for biomarker discovery. As described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), 10 individuals with the same colorectal pathology were included in each pool and were matched by recruitment hospital, sex, and age (median 62, range 51-72). There was no statistically significant difference in the mean age between pools (ANOVA, <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003C; 0.05). The age range matches the USPSTF guideline recommendation for CRC screening (50-75 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Pools were divided into no neoplasia and advanced colorectal neoplasia. The no neoplasia (NN) group comprised 13 cfDNA pooled samples: 3 pools of individuals with no colorectal findings (NCF), 5 pools of individuals with benign pathologies (BEN; hemorrhoids and diverticula), and 5 pools of individuals with non-advanced adenomas (NAA). On the other hand, the 15 cfDNA pooled samples of advanced neoplasia (AN) included 5 pools of individuals with advanced adenomas located only in the proximal colon (P-AA), 5 pools of individuals with advanced adenomas located in the distal colon or in both proximal and distal locations (D-AA), 3 pools of CRC patients stages I and II, and 2 pools of CRC stages III and IV. The final quantity of cfDNA in the pools ranged from 62 to 403 ng (Supplementary Table 1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Epigenome-wide biomarker discovery</title>
<p>MethylationEPIC BeadChip was used for quantitative DNA methylation profiling in the 28 cfDNA pooled samples. We correctly detected 97.78&#x0025; of the total probes present on the array. All failed positions (1,795 probes with a detection <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003E; 0.01 and 17,452 probes with a bead count &#x003C; 3) were removed before analysis. After quality control and data preprocessing, 18,035 probes were discarded as they did not hold the assumptions for linear regression model fitting (i.e. linearity, homoscedasticity, uncorrelatedness, and normality of the standardized residuals). After quality control and preprocessing, a total of 741,310 CpG sites mapped to the human genome assembly GRCh37/hg19 were left for differential methylation testing. No samples were removed due to quality issues.</p>
<p>The purpose of screening programs includes the early detection of preclinical CRC and the detection and removal of AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>); therefore, differential methylation was assessed between NN and AN groups. The analysis between these cfDNA pools revealed 376 differentially methylated positions (10&#x0025; FDR, BH-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), annotated to a total of 290 gene regions and 183 CpG islands. Chromosomes 1 and 2 hold the majority of DMPs (10.4&#x0025; and 7.7&#x0025;, respectively) possibly due to their larger length. Most CpG sites (326 DMPs, 86.7&#x0025;) were found to be hypermethylated in AN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Concerning the distribution across functional elements, DMPs were mainly located in open sea regions (51.59&#x0025;) and CpG islands (23.67&#x0025;) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Differentially hypermethylated positions were significantly enriched in CpG islands, shelves, and gene body regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Clustering analyses of all pooled samples based on the methylation values of the 376 DMPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) suggest the capacity of this differentially methylated signature to discriminate advanced neoplasia from no neoplasia controls.</p>

<p>In order to identify the most relevant features we followed a robust strategy of selection. We first applied the constraint-based SES feature selection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) on the 376 DMPs to identify combinations of CpGs whose performances for the NN vs AN classification were statistically equivalent. A total of 3,256 combinations of CpG pairs were obtained. Secondly, we used two strategies for filtering: (a) the CpG pairs were used to build classification models (support vector machine, logit regression, and random forest) that were cross-validated in the cfDNA pools by the leave-one-out strategy, due to limited sample size. CpG sites present in models with more than 20&#x0025; prediction error were discarded. And then (b) the remaining CpG sites were ranked according to the mean difference in the methylation levels. From the ranked list we selected the top 15 CpG sites with greater methylation differences and present in models with minimum classification error. Finally, due to the limited sensitivity of FIT for the detection of advanced adenomas, especially those of proximal location, we also selected 3 additional CpG sites that presented 0&#x0025; prediction error for the detection of advanced adenomas (1 CpG site derived from the NN vs D-AA comparison; 2 CpG sites derived from the NN vs P-AA comparison).</p>
<p>In parallel, we carried out a comparison between an external reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) dataset and our methylation microarray data. The RRBS dataset comprised serum and tissue samples from patients with CRC, AA, and healthy controls. We combined both datasets to select a subset of 8 CpG sites that reported more than 30&#x0025; differences in the methylation levels by bisulfite sequencing, and whose methylation differences showed the same direction in our methylation microarray data (i.e. hyper/hypomethylated in AN in both datasets).</p>
<p>Altogether, a total of 26 CpG positions were selected as candidate biomarkers (Supplementary Table 2) whose methylation levels and their ability to discriminate colorectal advanced neoplasia are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>.</p>

<title>Evaluation of candidate methylation biomarkers and further selection in individual samples</title>
<p>To evaluate the performance of the 26 candidate biomarkers in individual serum samples, methylation of the CpG positions of interest was quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing in an independent cohort of 153 individuals (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which was randomly split between a biomarker evaluation cohort (30&#x0025;, n=48) and a biomarker validation cohort (70&#x0025;, n=105). Methylation levels of the v2 promoter region of the <italic>SEPT9</italic> gene were also quantified in all samples. A detailed description of the pyrosequenced regions and the number of CpG positions analyzed within each biomarker can be found in Supplementary Table 3. The construction of methylation models for CRC screening was conducted in two phases.</p>
<p>First, the 26 candidate biomarkers were evaluated in a subset of 48 serum samples (30&#x0025;). The methylation levels of the 26 candidate biomarkers in both pooled (MethylationEPIC-derived) and individual cfDNA samples (bisulfite pyrosequencing) are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">B</xref>. There was a significant positive correlation (Pearson&#x2019;s r &#x003E; 0.6, <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003C; 0.001) between cfDNA methylation in pooled and serum samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C, D</xref>). To further reduce the number of amplicons for validation, penalized logistic regressions were fitted to the complete list of 26 candidate biomarkers. Classification performance parameters were derived by leave-one-out cross-validation. We produced sparse models containing two (<italic>GALNT9</italic> and <italic>UPF3A</italic>; AUC: 0.905, 95&#x0025; CI 0.801-1) and four (<italic>GALNT9, UPF3A, WARS</italic>, and <italic>LDB2</italic>; AUC: 0.827, 95&#x0025; CI 0.651-1) methylation biomarkers, derived by LASSO and Elastic net regularization, respectively. Also, the application of Elastic net to the 26 biomarkers, adding the clinical variables age and sex, generated a model containing 20 biomarkers and sex (AUC: 0.820, 95&#x0025; CI 0.675-0.966). The four biomarkers selected by the sparse models are included in the 20-biomarker signature. Hence, this 20 biomarker set was selected to proceed with the validation phase.</p>

<p>The model composed of <italic>GALNT9</italic> and <italic>UPF3A</italic> showed the best diagnostic performance for CRC screening, yielding an AUC of 0.896 (95&#x0025; CI 0.835-0.958), discriminating advanced neoplasia from no neoplasia controls with 78.8&#x0025; sensitivity and 100&#x0025; specificity. That model identified 33 out of 42 AA cases (78.6&#x0025;) and 19 out of 24 CRC patients (79.2&#x0025;), with great detection of CRC early stages (87.5&#x0025; and 100&#x0025; for stages I and II, respectively). This 2-biomarker panel detected 87&#x0025; of distal AA and 68.4&#x0025; proximal AA. On the other hand, the resulting AUC for the model containing <italic>GALNT9, UPF3A, WARS</italic>, and <italic>LDB2</italic> was 0.864 (95&#x0025; CI 0.798-0.931), with a sensitivity of 62.1&#x0025; and a specificity of 97.4&#x0025;, detecting 28 out of 42 AA (66.7&#x0025;; 78.3&#x0025; distal and 52.6&#x0025; proximal), and 13 out of 24 CRC cases (54.2&#x0025;; 37.5 stage I and 75&#x0025; stage II). These two models demonstrated no significant differences in the detection of distal AA compared to proximal ones (Fisher&#x2019;s exact test <italic>p</italic>-value &#x003E; 0.05). The model containing 20 biomarkers and sex, reported the highest sensitivity (92.4&#x0025;) and the highest detection rates for AA and CRC (92.9&#x0025; and 91.7&#x0025;, respectively), but with considerably less specificity (17.9&#x0025;) when compared to the previous models. The logistic classification rules of the model containing <italic>GALNT9, UPF3A, WARS</italic>, and <italic>LDB2</italic> and the <italic>GANL9</italic>/<italic>UPF3A</italic> model are detailed in Supplementary information. <italic>GALNT9</italic> (CG3) was hypermethylated in AN with a methylation difference of 0.36&#x0025;, whilst <italic>UPF3A</italic> (CG15), <italic>WARS</italic> (CG5), and <italic>LDB2</italic> (CG24) showed hypomethylation in AN with methylation differences of 1.25&#x0025;, 0.22&#x0025;, and 0.96&#x0025;, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">C</xref>).</p>
<p>Since plasma samples are most commonly used as a source of cfDNA, methylation of <italic>GALNT9, UPF3A, WARS</italic>, and <italic>LDB2</italic> was also evaluated in 8 pairs of matched serum and plasma samples.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Early detection has proven to be the most effective strategy to reduce both the incidence and mortality of CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>); nevertheless, most current screening programs suffer from low participation rates. The FIT is the most widely implemented and recommended non-invasive test for CRC screening despite having a modest sensitivity for the detection of premalignant AA (22-56&#x0025;, 90-94&#x0025; specificity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and also improbable compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Currently, there is no non-invasive biomarker for the early detection of CRC and AA that meets all the characteristics of an ideal screening test: easy to perform, safe, highly specific and sensitive, cost-effective, and well accepted by patients. To this end, the development of liquid biopsy technology has shown to be a promising approach for CRC screening, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), with the potential to be integrated into the clinic.</p>
<p>In this study, we first conducted an epigenome-wide analysis with the MethylationEPIC array using a cfDNA pooling approach to discover potential blood-based biomarkers for CRC. After prioritization of candidate biomarkers and evaluating their methylation levels in individual samples from an independent cohort, we developed and cross-validated three prediction models for the detection of AN. The first one, the 20 methylation biomarkers with sex, yielded a sensitivity of 92.4&#x0025; for AN, at 18&#x0025; specificity. Despite its high sensitivity and highest detection rate for AA (92.9&#x0025;) and CRC (91.7&#x0025;), such low specificity is not cost-effective for screening programs. Secondly, the model composed of <italic>GALNT9, UPF3A, WARS</italic>, and <italic>LDB2</italic> reported 62.1&#x0025; sensitivity and 97.4&#x0025; specificity, whilst the <italic>GALNT9</italic>/<italic>UPF3A</italic> model discriminated AN with 78.8&#x0025; sensitivity and 100&#x0025; specificity, showing the best prediction performance for CRC screening. The sensitivities reported for our biomarkers are comparable to that of FIT for CRC detection (73-88&#x0025;) and higher than its sensitivity for AA (22-56&#x0025;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The combination <italic>GALNT9</italic>/<italic>UPF3A</italic> also fulfills the main objective of CRC screening, that is the detection of preclinical CRC and premalignant AA, as reported great detection rate for AA (78.6&#x0025;) and early CRC stages I and II (87.5&#x0025; and 100&#x0025;, respectively). Also, no statistically significant differences were reported between the detection of distal (87&#x0025;) and proximal (68.4&#x0025;) AA, in contrast with the FIT that performs better for distal lesions than proximal ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The decreased detection of stage IV tumors (33.3&#x0025;) would not affect the effectiveness of CRC screening, since individuals with late-stage cancers are commonly symptomatic and therefore will not be enrolled in average-risk programs.</p>
<p>Only UPF3A has been previously related to CRC. Located in a CpG island shelf, we reported the hypomethylation of UPF3A in AN; and high expression levels of this gene associate with TNM stage, liver metastasis, and recurrence in CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). GALNT9 is also located in a CpG island and showed hypermethylation in AN, which was also reported in brain metastasis from breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). On the other hand, WARS and LDB2 also show hypomethylation in AN but are located within opensea regions. The methylation of regions outside GpG islands does not always directly relate to gene silencing. High expression levels of WARS were found in MSI-H gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, associated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), whilst a decreased expression of LDB2 was associated with a more favorable outcome in lung adenocarcinoma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>Nowadays, the only non-invasive methylation biomarker approved by the FDA for the detection of CRC in blood is based on the methylation of the SEPT9 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Nevertheless, the results on the diagnostic performance of this plasma biomarker are variable and inconsistent, with sensitivities ranging from 48.2-95.6&#x0025; for CRC and 11.2-35&#x0025; for AA, with 79.1-99.1&#x0025; specificity. In an asymptomatic average-risk cohort, SEPT9 showed lower screening performance than FIT (sensitivity: 68&#x0025; vs. 79&#x0025;; specificity: 80&#x0025; vs. 94&#x0025;, respectively), reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). In our study, we evaluated the performance of SEPT9 in both our discovery and validation cohorts. The 3 CpG sites targeting SEPT9 interrogated in the MethylationEPIC BeadChip, showed an average of 0.14&#x0025; methylation difference between NN and AN; while in the final validation cohort, the sensitivity for AN and AA resulted in 15.1&#x0025; and 7&#x0025;, respectively, with 100&#x0025; specificity. Unlike the commercial test, based on qPCR positive reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), we quantified the methylation of the SEPT9 promoter by pyrosequencing and thus the results may not be fully comparable.</p>
<p>Several blood-based methylation biomarkers have recently emerged for the early detection of CRC. Plasma BCAT1 and IKZF1 methylation reported sensitivities of 66&#x0025; and 5&#x0025; for CRC and AA, respectively, at 95&#x0025; specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Methylation markers C9orf50, KCNQ5, and CLIP4 reported 85&#x0025; sensitivity and 99&#x0025; specificity for CRC detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Methylated SFRP2 and SDC2 detected CRC and AA with sensitivities of 76.2&#x0025; and 58.3&#x0025;, and 87.9&#x0025; specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). A single plasma methylation biomarker, cg10673833, demonstrated 89.7&#x0025; sensitivity and 86.8&#x0025; specificity for CRC, but the sensitivity dropped up to 33.3&#x0025; against precancerous lesions (including AA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). In contrast with the aforementioned available studies, which are based on results reported in cell lines, tissue, or stool, the design of our study targets the final sample format for both the discovery and validation phases, enhancing this way the possibility to discover and translate a robust non-invasive biomarker. From our proposed models, the combination <italic>GALNT9</italic>/<italic>UPF3A</italic> showed an acceptable 78.8&#x0025; sensitivity for the joint detection of AA and CRC, and superior specificity of 100&#x0025; than other reported potential biomarkers. A cost-effective biomarker for CRC screening should present a low false-positive rate to minimize the number of unnecessary, expensive, and invasive colonoscopies. Thus, the highest specificity is sought for CRC screening.</p>
<p>In the ongoing validation of CRC screening biomarkers, it is important to consider data on protocol acceptability. A blood-based test has the potential to improve compliance and participation in CRC screening, as reported by a randomized controlled trial where 99.5&#x0025; of subjects who were offered a SEPT9 as the first option for CRC screening completed the test within six weeks, compared to 88.1&#x0025; of participants in the FIT arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). It was also reported that 83&#x0025; of individuals enrolled for screening who refused colonoscopy, preferred a blood-based test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). To optimize the participation in CRC screening, perhaps both a fecal and a blood-based test should be offered to target different preferences. A blood test could be proposed as a screening option to invitees refusing FIT and other guidelines recommended tests. This is indeed the indication for the SEPT9 test in average-risk individuals older than 50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Another option for implementing a blood test in screening programs is triaging FIT-positive individuals for improved selection to colonoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> shows a schematic representation of the possible implementation of a blood test in CRC screening, both as an alternative to FIT aiming to increase participation rates, and as a triage approach to optimize selection to colonoscopy.</p>

<caption><title>Schematic representation of the proposed approach for the implementation of a blood-based test in CRC screening.</title>
<p>To target different sample preferences and improve participation rates, a blood test could be offered to individuals refusing the FIT (left arm). In combination with the FIT, the blood test may improve selection to follow-up colonoscopy after a positive FIT (right arm). A FIT test would be offered every two years to individuals rejecting both the FIT and the blood test, and to individuals with a previous negative result in either the FIT or blood-based test.</p></caption>

<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducting a serum-based discovery and validation of cfDNA methylation biomarkers for CRC screening. Our multicentre cohort includes not only CRC, AA, and healthy controls, but also benign pathologies typically found during screening programs that influence the specificity, such as non-advanced adenomas, hemorrhoids, and diverticula. It is worth mentioning that our healthy individuals are not <italic>self-declared</italic> but colonoscopically confirmed and that the criteria of inclusion and age range of the patients follow the USPSTF guidelines for CRC screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Also, we have checked that there is no difference in the methylation levels of our biomarkers between serum and plasma cfDNA, and the low volume of serum used (up to 2 mL) is feasible in clinical practice. The ability of our methylation biomarkers to specifically detect CRC was also assessed, identifying 18.75&#x0025; cancer samples as advanced neoplasia by the <italic>GALNT9</italic>/<italic>UPF3A</italic> model, and 6.25&#x0025; by the <italic>GALNT9, UPF3A, WARS</italic>, and <italic>LDB2</italic> model.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our study has some limitations. Firstly, CRC cases were mostly diagnosed having symptoms, and secondly, the proportions of CRC cases, tumor stages, and the rest of pathologies are not fully representative of a screening population. A large prospective validation in an asymptomatic average-risk screening population will be necessary before the implementation of any of the proposed methylation models.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have discovered and reported <italic>GALNT9, UPF3A, WARS</italic>, and <italic>LDB2</italic> as new potential non-invasive biomarkers for the early detection of colorectal neoplasia. Overall, our results suggest that the combination <italic>GALNT9</italic>/<italic>UPF3A</italic> is the most promising to serve as a highly specific blood-based test for screening and detection of CRC at an early and curable stage, even at the premalignant lesion phase, which needs further validation in a real screening setting.</p>

<p>Individuals were recruited from the following Spanish Hospitals: Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Ourense (Ourense), Hospital Cl&#x00ED;nic de Barcelona (Barcelona), Hospital Donostia (San Sebasti&#x00E1;n), and Hospital General Universitario de Alicante (Alicante). A total of 435 individuals between 50-75 years old were selected. Exclusion criteria included a personal history of CRC, digestive cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, a severe synchronic illness, and a previous colectomy. All individuals included in the study underwent a colonoscopy which was performed by experienced endoscopists following the recommendations from the Spanish guidelines on quality of colonoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Blood samples were obtained immediately before the colonoscopy procedure. Blood samples were coagulated and subsequently centrifuged according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions for serum collection. Serum samples were stored at &#x2212;20 &#x00B0;C until cfDNA extraction. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from 0.5-2 mL according to availability.</p>
<p>Individuals were classified according to the most advanced colorectal finding. Lesions were considered &#x2018;proximal&#x2019; when located only proximal to the splenic flexure of the colon and &#x2018;distal&#x2019; when found only in the distal colon or in both distal and proximal colon. Advanced adenomas (AA) are defined as adenomas &#x2265; 1 cm, with villous components or high-grade dysplasia.</p>
<p>We performed a stratified random sampling using colorectal findings and sex as stratifying variables. Strata were matched by age and recruitment hospital. This multicenter cohort was separated into two independent subsets: Biomarker discovery sample set (n=280; 140 female and 140 male) and Biomarker validation sample set (n=153; 72 female and 83 male).</p>
<p>Biomarker discovery sample set included 30 individuals with no colorectal findings (NCF), 50 with benign pathologies (BEN: hemorrhoids and diverticula), 50 with non-advanced adenomas (NAA), 50 with proximal AA (P-AA), 50 with distal AA (D-AA), and 50 CRC cases (17 stage I, 13 stage II, 13 stage III and 7 stage IV, according to the AJCC staging system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). On the other hand, the Biomarker validation sample set comprised 22 NCF individuals, 20 benign pathologies, 18 NAA, 31 D-AA, 27 P-AA, and 35 CRC cases (11 stage I, 11 stage II, 6 stage III, and 7 stage IV). &#x2018;Advanced colorectal neoplasia&#x2019; (AN) was defined as AA or CRC. In contrast, NCF, BEN, and NAA were considered together as &#x2018;no neoplasia&#x2019; (NN) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The specificity of the biomarkers for the detection of colorectal cancer and advanced adenomas was evaluated in an independent cohort of 16 patients with different cancer types, including breast (n=4), kidney (n=2), lung (n=5), ovary (n=1), and prostate (n=4) cancer (Supplementary Table 4). Additionally, 8 pairs of matched serum and plasma samples from the same individual were used to account for differences in the methylation levels between serum and plasma (3NCF, 2 BEN, and 3 NAA).</p>

<title>DNA extraction and sample poling</title>
<p>cfDNA from samples used for biomarker discovery was extracted with a phenol-chloroform protocol as described by Hufnagl et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), with minor modifications. DNA was quantified in each sample using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For methylation biomarker discovery we followed a DNA pooling strategy. A detailed description of the pooling protocol can be found in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). 28 independent cfDNA pooled samples were constructed using equal amounts of cfDNA from 5 men and 5 women from the same pathological group, recruitment hospital- and age-matched. The cfDNA pools were stored at &#x2212; 20 &#x00B0;C and were sent to the Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC) facilities at the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain) for processing and methylation quantification.</p>
<p>The QIAmp circulating nucleic acids kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for cfDNA extraction from serum and plasma samples in the validation phase. Individual cfDNA samples were bisulfite-converted using EZ DNA Methylation-Direct Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. Bisulfite treated cfDNA samples were stored at -80&#x00B0;C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Genome-wide DNA methylation measurements</title>
<p>DNA methylation of pooled samples was measured with the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Pooled samples were bisulfite-treated and arrays were hybridized following the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. A total of 865,859 CpG sites were quantified throughout the genome, covering promoter CpG islands, RefSeq genes, open chromatin, and enhancer intergenic regions identified by FANTOM5 and ENCODE projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Importantly, to minimize the potential impact of batch effects and confounder variability, samples of each pathological group were randomly allocated to the slides.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Methylation biomarker discovery</title>
<p>Illumina methylation data were preprocessed and analyzed using the R environment (versions 3.3.3 and 3.4.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) with R and Bioconductor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>) packages (see supplementary information for details on quality control and preprocessing). Methylation levels were expressed as beta-values for visualization and intuitive interpretation of the results. Methylation expressed as M-values (<italic>logit</italic> transformation of the beta-values) were used for differential methylation analysis and biomarker selection, as recommended by Du et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). To test for differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between AN (AA or CRC) and NN (NCF, BEN, or NAA) we used the <italic>limma</italic> package [8]: linear models were fitted for each CpG site across all samples by generalized least squares, and an empirical Bayes method was used to compute the p-values. As recommended by Mansell et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) linear regression assumptions were checked for each model using the <italic>gvlma</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>).</p>
<p>To select and prioritize the DMPs as candidate biomarkers we first applied the constraint-based Statistically Equivalent Signature (SES) algorithm for feature selection, contained in the <italic>MXM</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>): multiple CpG sets with minimal size and maximal predictive power for the binary classification problem NN vs AN were obtained by iteratively comparing logistic regression models through a chi-square test. Then, the different CpG subsets were used to build classification models based on support vector machine (<italic>e1071</italic> package) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>), random forest (<italic>randomForest</italic> package) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), and logistic regression. Models were cross-validated to select candidate CpG biomarkers with minimum prediction error for NN vs AN classification.</p>
<p>Methylation microarray data were compared with an external RRBS (Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing) dataset targeting CpG-rich regions of 20 AA and 27 CRC cases, with matched adenoma/tumor, healthy mucosa, and serum samples of each patient; and 24 serum samples from healthy controls. A subset of CpG sites that reported concordance in methylation differences between NN and AN in both datasets were added to the biomarker list.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Targeted methylation quantification by bisulfite pyrosequencing</title>
<p>The methylation levels of the candidate biomarkers, together with the v2 promoter region of the SEPT9 gene, were evaluated by bisulfite pyrosequencing in 153 individual serum samples. PCR and sequencing primers were designed with the PyroMark Assay Design software (version 2.0.1.15, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Bisulfite-converted cfDNA (2 &#x03BC;l) was subjected to PCR amplification using primers flanking the CpG candidate biomarkers. Multiplex reactions including 3-6 candidate markers were performed, followed by nested singleplex PCR reactions using a biotin-labeled primer. Primers and PCR conditions for multiplex and singleplex PCR are provided in Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table 3. Biotin-labeled amplicons were further resolved and visualized on 3&#x0025; agarose gels. Pyrosequencing was performed using a PyroMark Q96 ID pyrosequencer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol for CpG methylation quantification. Data acquisition and methylation measurements were conducted at the Biomedical Research Institute of Malaga facilities (IBIMA, M&#x00E1;laga, Spain) using PyroMark Q96 ID software, CpG analysis mode (version 1.0.11).</p>
<p>Fully methylated and unmethylated controls were included in each run and were used to check bisulfite conversion, the performance of the assay, and to account for batch-to-batch variation. DNA extracted from peripheral blood from a donor was used to prepare controls. For the fully methylated control DNA was treated with CpG methyltransferase (M.SssI; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), while for the unmethylated control whole genome amplification was performed to eliminate any methylation marks (illustra GenomiPhi V2 DNA Amplification Kit, GE Healthcare; Chicago, IL, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>Biomarker selection and classification model development</title>
<p>Both raw and log10-transformed methylation percentages were subjected to multivariate analyses for the development and validation of methylation-based classification models. The validation set of 153 individual samples was randomly divided for the multi-step process of methylation panel development (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>First, a preliminary evaluation of the methylation levels of the candidate biomarkers was carried out in a 30&#x0025; sample subset (n=48, 21 NN, 8 D-AA, 8 P-AA, and 11 CRC cases). Penalized logistic regressions Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Elastic net were applied to the candidate biomarkers, age, and sex for feature selection, with the <italic>glmnet</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). The minimum mean cross-validation error was used to define the penalty factor for LASSO and Elastic Net models. Biomarkers present in the LASSO and Elastic net-derived models were selected for validation. Then, multivariate logistic regressions were fitted in the remaining 70&#x0025; samples (n=105, 39 NN, 23 D-AA, 19 P-AA, and 24 CRC cases) to derive models based on the selected biomarkers.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed with the R environment (version 3.4.0). In the epigenome-wide methylation analyses, <italic>p</italic>-values were adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate (FDR). One-sided Fisher&#x2019;s exact tests were used to assess the significance of the enrichment of the DMPs to functionally annotated elements using the annotation of the complete array as background. To assess the performance of the classification models, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were elaborated, derived by the leave-one-out cross-validation approach, and AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values, were estimated with their corresponding 95&#x0025; confidence intervals. The best cut-off values were determined by the Youden Index method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Negative and positive predictive values (NPV, PPV) were also estimated for the best cut-off values. Fisher&#x2019;s exact tests were employed to compare the proportion of distal and proximal lesions detected. Non-parametrical Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare methylation levels between matched serum and plasma samples.</p>
