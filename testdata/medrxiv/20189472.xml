<sec>
<title>Background and aims</title>
<p>It is important to determine an accurate demarcation line (DL) between the cancerous lesions and background mucosa in magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI)-based diagnosis. However, it is difficult for novice endoscopists. Recently, machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep learning have been applied to this issue; however, this results in the burden of training ML models and labeling large datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose and a DL determination system using an unsupervised ML method.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Our method consists of the following four steps: 1) An M-NBI image is segmented into superpixels (a group of neighboring pixels) using simple linear iterative clustering. 2) The image features are extracted for each superpixel. 3) The superpixels are grouped into several clusters using k-means method. 4) The boundaries of the clusters are extracted as DL candidates. To validate the proposed method, 16 M-NBI images of 4 cases were used for performance evaluation. The evaluation investigated the similarity of the DLs identified by endoscopists and our method, and the Euclidean distance between the two DLs was calculated.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>The average Euclidean distances for the four cases were 13.07, 19.95, 12.53, and 17.90. The results indicated that the specific selection of the number of clusters enabled the proposed method to detect DLs that were similar to those of the endoscopists. The DLs identified by our method represented the complex shapes of the DLs, similarly to those identified by experienced doctors.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our proposed system can support the training of inexperienced doctors, as well as enriching the knowledge of experienced doctors in endoscopy.</p></sec>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths following lung cancer and colorectal cancer, and has claimed the lives of approximately 729,000 people worldwide per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The five-year survival rate exceeds 90&#x0025; if gastric cancer is detected at an early stage, but it declines in later cancer stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Thus, early detection is a crucial issue in gastric cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Several studies have reported that magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) is useful for diagnosing the existence of early gastric cancer and determining its horizontal extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The detected cancer lesions can subsequently be removed endoscopically by means of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>However, ESD exhibits certain matters of concern, such as complications and the risk of non-curative resection (remnants of cancer) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Although this is also the case for other endoscopic procedures, accidental perforation sometimes occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, the incorrect recognition of the demarcation line (DL) is disadvantageous to patients. When endoscopists underestimate the DL, this may lead to non-curative resection. In contrast, if they overestimate the DL, they may perform ESD containing extensive unnecessary lesions, which also increases the risk of perforation or a long procedure time. Therefore, it is important to determine an accurate DL between the cancerous lesions and background mucosa. However, this determination is difficult for novice endoscopists, with long-term training and experience being required.</p>
<p>In this context, with the recent development of machine learning (ML) technology, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are playing an increasingly important role in the medical field, and are expected to aid endoscopists with accurate and stable disease detection and diagnosis. In the gastroenterology field, CAD systems for the detection of esophagus cancer, gastric cancer, <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, and the characterization of colorectal lesions have been developed and validated for clinical use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we developed a new CAD system that automatically determines the DL on a given M-NBI image through an ML method. The main objectives of the proposed system are to provide the DL candidates for diagnosis of the disease range of early gastric cancer to endoscopists, as well as to support accurate and stable diagnosis. In recent years, research on image diagnosis using supervised ML such as deep learning has attracted significant interest in medicine owing to its higher classification and prediction performance compared to conventional methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. However, disadvantages exist in obtaining high-performance results in these methods. First, it is necessary to prepare an enormous amount of annotated training data (for example, &#x2018;lesion&#x2019; or &#x2018;non-lesion&#x2019; labels are provided to each datum by endoscopists) to construct the classification model. These annotations need to be performed by highly experienced endoscopists, and are therefore impractical. Second, the diagnosis rationale and criteria are unclear because the available deep learning methodologies are mainly black-box models. It is difficult to extract such knowledge from a deep learning model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>To overcome these issues, in this study, we used a data clustering method, which is a type of unsupervised ML technique. Given a single M-NBI image, the proposed method divides it into several segments, and then identifies the clusters in which segments with relevant features are densely located. Consequently, the boundary between the gastric cancer lesions and background mucosa; that is, the DL, can be identified. The diagnosis rationale or criteria can be interpreted following the determination of the DL because we specify the potentially discriminating features of gastric cancer prior to performing the data clustering. Furthermore, the proposed method does not require any annotations or computational efforts. Thus, the approach can be applied to determine the DL for early gastric cancer diagnosis.</p>

<title>Proposed method</title>
<p>A schematic of the proposed method is presented in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>. It mainly consists of the following four steps: (1) image segmentation, (2) feature extraction, (3) segment-based clustering, and (4) identification of DL candidates. First, an input M-NBI image is segmented into a certain number of superpixels, each of which is a set of pixels with similar color features. Second, the image features including not only the colors but also the texture features are calculated for each superpixel. Third, the superpixels are grouped into a predetermined number of clusters using a data clustering method. Finally, the boundaries of the multiple clusters are extracted as the DL candidates and are presented to the users of the proposed system (that is, endoscopists). The majority of data clustering methods divide the dataset into clusters so as to minimize the intracluster distance or/and maximize the intercluster distance. Therefore, we hypothesized that the DL could be extracted as the boundary of the clusters, because the cancer lesions that would have different image features from the non-cancer lesions should form the cluster. Note that our system was designed to identify only the DL &#x2018;candidates&#x2019;, which is why it does not require image annotation by endoscopists. The final decision of selecting the DL from the candidates is the responsibility of the user endoscopists. The details of each of the four steps are described in the following sections.</p>

<title>Image segmentation</title>
<p>Several superpixel algorithms have been presented that partition an image into multiple segments. In this study, we used simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], which is one of the most popular methods in image processing. In the SLIC algorithm, a group of pixels that are similar in terms of both their color features and position (coordinates) are formed as a superpixel. The boundary shapes of the superpixels are iteratively refined by means of the well-known <italic>k</italic>-means-based clustering approach. First, the input image is divided into a certain number of grids. The center of each tile (the initial form of a superpixel) is sampled and then moved to the pixel with the lowest color gradient among the neighboring pixels. Thereafter, for each pixel in the entire image, the nearest center pixel in terms of both the color and coordinate spaces is searched, and it is assigned to the member of the identified pixel. This procedure is repeated until certain types of termination criteria are satisfied, so that the superpixels are generated. For further details on SLIC, please refer to the original paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. In this study, we used the <italic>slic</italic> function implemented in scikit-image, which is a Python library.</p>
<p>Prior to applying the SLIC image segmentation, we had to determine the color space to represent the image feature. In this study, we employed the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) L&#x002A;a&#x002A;b&#x002A; color space as the image features for segmentation because it is device independent and also matches with human color perception. It is represented by three-dimensional space consisting of L&#x002A;, which represents the darkness to lightness, a&#x002A;, which varies from red to green, and b&#x002A;, which varies from blue to green [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2a2">
<label>2.1.2</label>
<title>Feature extraction and clustering</title>
<p>After segmenting an input M-NBI image into a set of superpixels, they are further merged into the clusters of the superpixels using the <italic>k</italic>-means method. That is, the local clustering of the pixels to extract the pixel-level image feature is performed by SLIC, following which the global clustering of the superpixels is further performed by the <italic>k</italic>-means method. In the global clustering process, the aim is to identify a cluster of cancer lesions by evaluating each superpixel in terms of both the color and texture features.</p>
<p>The CIE L&#x002A;a&#x002A;b&#x002A; and HSV color spaces were used for representing the color features. The HSV color space is defined by three components: hue, saturation, and value. Hue represents the color type (for example, red, blue, and yellow) ranging from 0 to 360 degrees, saturation represents the color vividness ranging from 0 to 100&#x0025;, and value represents the color brightness from 0 to 100&#x0025; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The coordinates in both color spaces can be calculated by nonlinear transformation from the RGB color space.</p>
<p>In addition to the color features, we aimed to extract the texture features of gastric cancer lesions. Yao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>] set their criterion for early gastric carcinoma as (1) the presence of an irregular microvascular pattern or (2) the presence of an irregular microsurface pattern, both of which were accompanied by a clear DL. Therefore, we expected that the texture features of a gastric cancer lesion could be extracted if the irregularities of the microvascular and microsurface patterns were quantified. We used the local entropy, which quantifies the complexity such as the randomness of the image, proposed by Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The local entropy score <italic>H</italic>(<italic>S</italic>) of the image block <italic>S</italic> (corresponding to a superpixel in this study) in a given image can be defined by:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="20189472v1_eqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>l</italic> &#x2208; {0, 1, &#x2026;, L - 1} denotes the pixel intensity scale (for example, <italic>L</italic> = 256 for an 8-bit grayscale image) and <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>, <italic>T</italic>, and <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> denote the total number of pixels within S at pixel intensity <italic>l</italic>, the total number of pixels, and the probability of a pixel having the intensity <italic>l</italic>, respectively. In brief, the entropy used in this case quantifies the variability of the pixel values in the image. That is, we assumed that the irregularities of the microvascular and microsurface patterns could be represented by the probability distribution of the pixel values. Note that we calculated the local entropy score for each color dimension.</p>
<p>In total, we used 12-dimensional feature vectors (that is, the six color dimensions L&#x002A;, a&#x002A;, b&#x002A;, H, S, and V and the local entropy score for each of the six color dimensions) for the global clustering by the <italic>k</italic>-means method. We used the <italic>KMeans</italic> function implemented in scikit-learn.</p>

<label>2.1.3</label>
<title>Identification of DL</title>
<p>Following the global clustering of the superpixels, the boundaries of the clusters are extracted as the DL candidates, and are presented on the graphical user interface for the user endoscopists. As mentioned previously, our system is designed to provide the DL candidates and not to determine the exact DL. The final decision on the DL determination is made by the endoscopists by selecting one of the candidates. In this situation, it is necessary to provide varieties of the candidates for the users. Therefore, global clustering with different numbers of clusters (the control parameter <italic>k</italic> of the <italic>k</italic>-means method) was executed to provide the DL candidates at different segmentation levels of the M-NBI image. Examples of the cluster boundaries identified following the global clustering is illustrated in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>.</p>

<title>Test images</title>
<p>Endoscopic images obtained from October 2014 to January 2015 was used to establish the artificial intelligence (AI) system for the diagnosis of the disease range of gastric cancer. Those images were anonymized for the sake of personal information is not specified. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Asahi University Hospital (registration number: 2020-05-01) and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association. In this study, advanced expertise was required for processing images and making diagnostic algorithms. Therefore, all patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, and dissemination plans of our research.</p>
<p>A total of 16 gastric M-NBI images of 4 cases were used for the performance evaluation. All examinations were carried out using the EVIS LUCERA or EVIS LUCERA ELITE system and the upper gastrointestinal endoscope GIF-FQ260Z (Olympus Medical Systems, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). These endoscopic systems have normal observation and NBI modes. All images were acquired in the NBI mode combined with magnifying endoscopy. The clinical characteristics of the patients with early gastric cancer are summarized in <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref></bold>. The resolutions of these images were of two types: 865 &#x00D7; 999 and 736 &#x00D7; 850. Moreover, board-certified gastroenterologists at Asahi University Hospital had drawn the DLs on these images. An example of a DL drawn by an endoscopist is presented in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>It can be observed from <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold> that the different cluster number settings resulted in varying shapes of the DL candidates, and the distance to the DL provided by the endoscopist varied accordingly. Furthermore, <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold> indicates that the DL candidates provided by the proposed method became more similar to the endoscopist identification with an increase in the number of clusters. In most cases, the changes in the Euclidean distance were remarkable when <italic>k</italic> ranged from 2 to 4, and were saturated at <italic>k</italic> &#x003E;= 4. The approximation accuracy was improved with an increase in the number of clusters, because the complexity of the boundary shape increased. These results suggest that the proposed method could identify DL candidates that sufficiently approximated the endoscopist criteria at <italic>k</italic> = 4.</p>
<p>To confirm the above assumption, we observed several typical cases of the identified DL candidates. <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold> presents the DL candidates identified by the proposed method for CASE 4. At <italic>k</italic> = 2, the cluster boundary was drawn between the field of view (FOV) and black corner. At <italic>k</italic> = 3, although the boundary was added in the FOV, it simply divided the FOV into two regions where the brightness of the clusters were differentiated. At <italic>k</italic> = 4, the boundary was finally drawn between the clusters with different mucosal patterns. It can be observed that the DL candidate at <italic>k</italic> &#x003E;= 4 overlapped the DL provided by the endoscopist. These results visually confirm the assumption that our proposed method could sufficiently approximate the endoscopist criteria at <italic>k</italic> = 4.</p>

<p>The upper images present the DL candidates at each <italic>k</italic> value. The yellow and green lines indicate the DLs provided by the endoscopists and proposed system, respectively.

<graphic xlink:href="20189472v1_fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>However, as demonstrated by CASE 3 in <bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref></bold>, when no shaded regions were observed in the M-NBI image, the proposed method approximated the DL drawn by the endoscopist sufficiently at <italic>k</italic> = 3. No further improvements were observed at <italic>k</italic> &#x003E; 3, as confirmed both visually and quantitatively in <bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref></bold>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Therefore, it is confirmed that our proposed method could identify the DL similar to that provided by the endoscopist at approximately the number of clusters <italic>k</italic> = 4. Obviously, as this process depends on the varieties of M-NBI images, user endoscopists would select the appropriate one by adjusting the <italic>k</italic> value themselves. However, the observation of multiple DL candidates at different <italic>k</italic> values may offer new insights into endoscopic diagnosis to user endoscopists, because our method can indicate DLs in regions where endoscopists cannot provide a clear demarcation. This is one of the most important contributions of our study.</p>
<p>A further contribution of our study is that it provides the boundary &#x2018;line&#x2019; itself, instead of indicating the cancer lesions as a &#x2018;region&#x2019;. For example, Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] divided M-NBI images into non-cancerous and early gastric cancer groups using a convolutional neural network, which is one of the most well-known deep learning models. Moreover, Kanesaka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] detected cancer lesions using the support vector machine. Although they used a supervised ML method, they also aimed to obtain the cancer lesion &#x2018;region&#x2019;. Providing a &#x2018;line&#x2019; rather than a &#x2018;region&#x2019; using a CAD system is meaningful in enriching the knowledge of both inexperienced and experienced endoscopists.</p>
<p>In determining the horizontal extent of early gastric mucosal cancer using M-NBI, it is necessary to identify the DL to differentiate the mucosal patterns between cancer lesions and background mucosa. Consequently, the DL exhibits a complex geometric shape, as illustrated in <bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref></bold>. CASE 4 in <bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9(a)</xref></bold> included depressed lesions, and the endoscopist indicated the DL on the boundary between the depressed lesion and background mucosa. Moreover, <bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9(c)</xref></bold> indicates that the DL was drawn by tracing the light blue crest in CASE 3. In both cases, the endoscopists drew the DLs to trace the structural change in the white zone, and the DLs resulted in an intricate shape being formed. Notably, our proposed system could provide these irregular and complex shapes precisely, as illustrated in <bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figures 9(b)</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">(d)</xref></bold>.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, this study exhibits certain limitations. First, the small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 4) is problematic. Our system needs to be tested with a larger sample size to improve its reliability and robustness. This work focused on the proposal and development of a general framework for an automatic DL determination algorithm based on a data clustering method. Second, each DL may contain an individual bias because a single endoscopist drew it for each image. Although the DLs were assessed by multiple doctors in the present data, the other DL candidates should be provided by various endoscopists to reduce such bias. Finally, pathological evaluation has not been carried out in this study. Biopsies and the use of their results as ground truth for evaluating our proposed system are necessary to improve the system reliability and to proceed to clinical trials. Future work will focus on these issues. However, irrespective of these limitations, the current results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and will contribute the development of gastroenterology.</p>

<title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>We developed a new CAD system that can automatically determines the DL on a given M-NBI image through an ML method. In the proposed system, the boundaries of the clusters within M-NBI images are extracted as the DL candidates. The performance evaluation of the system on actual M-NBI images revealed that it can represent the complex shapes of the DLs, similarly to the DLs identified by experienced doctors. The identification of the DL is often quite a difficult task for inexperienced endoscopists. Therefore, our proposed system, which can provide a variety of DL candidates, may support the training of inexperienced doctors, as well as enriching the knowledge of experienced doctors.</p>
