<sec>
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Allergic rhinitis has a severe impact on patients&#x2019; life quality, and the incidence rate keeps increasing. Moxibustion is widely used for treating allergic rhinitis, and quantity is the basis of moxibustion efficacy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the different quantities of moxibustion and the efficacy of moxibustion in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. This study may be conductive to the standardization of moxibustion and furnish the mechanism of dose-effect relationship of moxibustion with data and new ideas.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods and analysis</title>
<p>This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial will include 33 patients with allergic rhinitis who will be randomly assigned into three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: high-dose moxibustion group, low-dose moxibustion group and sham moxibustion control group. All groups will be treated once every other day, 20 days for one treatment course. And the patients will receive treatment for 2 courses with an interval of 2 days between courses. We will conduct a follow-up 30 days later after completion of treatments. The primary outcome measure is Total Nasal Symptom Score, carried out at baseline, 3, 6 and 10 weeks. Secondary outcome measure is Rhino Conjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire, carried out at baseline, 6 and 10 weeks.</p></sec>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common immunologic disorder worldwide, with more than 500 million people affected. According to statistics, the incidence rate of about 5% to 20%, and the incidence rate keeps increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Allergic rhinitis is a non-infectious inflammation of nasal mucosa induced by IgE after exposure to the allergens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> The major clinical manifestations of allergic rhinitis include sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and nasal itching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Although allergic rhinitis does not threaten patients&#x2019; lives, it brings olfaction disorders, nasal symptoms, sleep apnea and so on, affecting patients&#x2019; life quality seriously. In addition, allergic rhinitis can cause psychological stress in patients, too.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Allergic rhinitis may lead to otitis media, sinusitis and other diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> According to research, medical cost of allergic rhinitis in the United States amounts to &#x0024;2 billion to &#x0024;5 billion a year. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>No cure for allergic rhinitis has been found. Treatments to alleviate AR symptoms are mainly pharmacotherapy and immunotherapy. Pharmacotherapy includes oral antihistamines, intranasal glucocorticosteroids and nasal decongestants. Subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy are the two types used in immunotherapy. However, both pharmacotherapy and immunotherapy bring undesirable adverse reactions and drug resistance. Pharmacotherapy may cause rhinitissicca, epistaxis, drymouth, dizziness and hypersomnia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> Immunotherapy may lead to rash, pruritus and allergic reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, with the advantages of significant efficacy, rare adverse reactions, low cost, convenience and high acceptance rate, moxibustion has been widely used for treating allergic rhinitis in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Literatures have reported that moxibustion has advantages in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> A clinical trial shows that moxibustion can decrease plasma IL-2, IL-6, and cGMP contents and that it can raise plasma cGMP level in allergic rhinitis patients. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> With the photothermal and pharmacological effects, moxibustion can achieve the aims of warming channels to dispel coldness and strengthening healthy qi to eliminate pathogens. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Since ancient times, the dose-effect relationship of moxibustion has been the focus of doctors of TCM. Quantity is the basis of the effect of moxibustion. Neither overdose nor underdose can achieve the desired effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> However, there are certain problems existing in clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> (1) There is a lack of criteria of quantity of moxibustion in the trials of allergic rhinitis. (2) There is a lack of clinical trial on the dose-effect relationship of moxibustion and explanation for the mechanism. (3) There is a lack of observation on the long-term efficacy of moxibustion for allergic rhinitis. The aim of this study is to reveal the dose-effect relationship of moxibustion in treating allergic rhinitis and evaluate its efficacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>OBJECTIVES</title>
<p>We will set up ginger interposed moxibustion groups with different quantities of moxibustion and administer the treatment. The purpose is to investigate the efficacy of ginger interposed moxibustion in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. This study will test if more quantities of ginger interposed moxibustion would achieve better therapeutic effects on allergic rhinitis. The trial will reveal the preliminary dose-effect relationship of moxibustion and provide references for the objective development of moxibustion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>METHODS AND ANALYSIS</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Study design and setting</title>
<p>This randomised, placebo-controlled and parallel clinical trial will be conducted in Shanghai TCM-Integrated Hospital, Shanghai University of TCM. We will enroll patients from the outpatient departments of Acupuncture and Moxibustion in Shanghai TCM-Integrated Hospital, Shanghai University of TCM. The patients will be randomly assigned into three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio:high-dose moxibustion group, low-dose moxibustion group and sham moxibustion control group. Through literature research, we select Dazhui (DU-14), Feishu(BL-13), Pishu (BL-20), Shenshu (BL-23), Shangyintang(extra ordinary point)and Hegu(LI-4)for the study. All groups will be treated once every other day, 20 days for one treatment course. And the patients will receive treatment for 2 courses with an interval of 2 days between courses. We will conduct a follow-up 30 days later after completion of treatments.</p>
<p>We will apply Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) and Rhino Conjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) to evaluate clinical effects of the three groups. By comparison of TNSS scores and RQLQ of different treatment courses, we will test if ginger interposed moxibustion would be effective in treating AR. And the curative effect will be calculated according to the difference of TNSS scores before and after treatment, which is used to test if the three groups would have statistical difference in effectiveness.</p>
<p>The principle of insulation with wanhua oil: When the moxa cone burns to the bottom soaked with wanhua oil, the moxa cone cannot ignite and will automatically extinguish. Previous studies have completed the preliminary research: the temperature of the bottom of the burning moxa cone soaked with wanhua oil is about 30 &#x00B0;C, the warm feeling temperature of normal human trunk skin is 34-38 &#x00B0;C, and the heat pain feeling temperature is 41-50 &#x00B0;C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> It indicates that moxa cone soaked with wanhua oil will not cause warm stimulation, thus avoiding the special therapeutic effect on human body.</p>
<p>The trial was registered at the China Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1800016371) on 26 August 2021. The study protocol was approved by Shanghai TCM-Integrated Hospital Ethics Committee (2021-051-1). This is the first version of the protocol, 27 August 2021. We will start the study in September, 2021 and is expected to complete by September, 2022. The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendation for Interventional Trials 2013 checklist is shown in online additional file 1.

<sec id="s4">
<title>INTERVENTIONS</title>
<p>After informed consent is obtained and a baseline evaluation performed, participants will be randomized to three study groups: high-dose moxibustion group, low-dose moxibustion group and sham moxibustion control group. All groups will be treated once every other day, 20 days for one treatment course. And the patients will receive treatment for 2 courses with an interval of 2 days between courses. We will conduct a follow-up 30 days later after completion of treatments. Before the trial researchers will participate in specialized training, by which standard intervention details including manipulation procedures and location of acupoints will be taught to researchers.</p>
<p>During the trial, participants are prohibited from using any drugs or other treatment methods for allergic rhinitis to avoid disturbance for the result of the trial.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>High-dose moxibustion group</title>
<p>Participants will be required to take prone position and expose the back in a fully equipped and temperature controlled room(24-28&#x00B0;C). Fresh slices of ginger (3 cm in diameter and 2-4 mm in thickness with pinpricks) will be placed at 7 standard acupoints: Dazhui(DU-14), bilateral Feishu(BL-13)&#x3001;Pishu(BL-20) and Shenshu(BL-23)(<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Then prepared moxa cones<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> (2.5 cm in diameter, 2 cm in height and 2.5 g in weight.) will be respectively placed above the ginger and ignited from the bottom. When one moxa cone burns out, replace it with a new moxa cone, with 6 moxa cones per acupoint. After completion of moxibustion in the back part, participants will take supine position. We will perform moxibustion in the same way at acupoints Shangyintang(extra ordinary point), bilateral Hegu(LI-4),with 6 moxa cones per acupoint.</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="21262781v1_tbl1a.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Every time Shangyintang(extra ordinary point) is performed moxibustion, paper which can fit the forehead will be placed between Shangyintang(extra ordinary point) and participants&#x2019; eyes. In this way smoke or smell produced by moxibustion can be blocked to avoid stimulating participant&#x2019;s nose and eyes. During the treatment, we will maintain a good ventilation and exhaust smoke. If participants feel an unbearable burning sensation, ginger slices will be changed to relieve pain. It is acceptable to move ginger following the line of Du Channel to alleviate burning sensation when performing moxibustion at Shangyintang(extra ordinary point).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Low-dose moxibustion group</title>
<p>Participants will receive low-dose ginger interposed moxibustion. Intervention procedures will be generally similar to high-dose moxibustion group. The only difference is that each identified acupoint requires only 3 moxa cones.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Sham moxibustion control group</title>
<p>The intervention procedures for this group will be similar to other two groups. Participants will be given sham moxibustion at the same acupoints. Moxa cones used in this group will be specially processed. Lower 1/3 of moxa cone will be soaked in wanhua oil<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> for inflaming retarding and heat insulation. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Then prepared moxa cones will be placed on the ginger slices and ignited from the top, with 3 moxa cones per acupoint.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Follow-up</title>
<p>Participants will receive treatment for 6 weeks and will be followed up after 4 weeks. At follow-up period, participants will be evaluated through phone calls, WeChat or E-mail. Specific items will be recorded (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Outcome measurements</title>
<sec id="s4e1">
<title>primary outcomes</title>
<p>The primary outcome is Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In accordance with national guidelines, the trial will identify symptoms of AR by using TNSS (total nasal symptom score). TNSS is a valid and reliable instrument that has been used widely in a variety of clinical trials involving patients with allergic rhinitis to evaluate change of nasal symptoms and measure effect of treatment.</p>
<p>We will apply TNSS to evaluate patients&#x2019; symptoms: sneezing (the number of continuous sneezes); rhinorrhea (the frequency of blowing nose per day); nasal congestion and nasal itching at baseline and 3, 6 and 10 weeks. The score of every item in TNSS ranges from 0 to 3, where 0=no symptoms, 1=mild symptom(s) (present but bearable), 2=moderate symptom(s) (present and uncomfortable) and 3=severe symptom(s) (unbearable)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e2">
<title>secondary outcome</title>
<p>The trial will measure the problems that people with rhino conjunctivitis face in their daily lives by using Rhino Conjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Previous study has proved that the RQLQ(S) possesses strong discriminative (cross-sectional) and evaluative (longitudinal) measurement properties which make it secure and reliable to measure rhino conjunctivitis quality of life in clinical studies. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rhino conjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) will be applied at baseline and 6 and 10 weeks. It includes 28 questions in seven domains including activity limitations, sleep disturbances, non-nasal or eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, ocular symptoms and emotional problems. Participants will be asked to score each question according to their daily experiences and feelings. The score of every item of RQLQ ranges from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating severer symptoms and more disturbances.</p>

<title>Data collection and management</title>
<p>Data will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 weeks and 10 weeks (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The participant&#x2019;s name, gender, age, course of disease, contact information, medical records and other general information should be recorded prior to trail. To facilitate data reliability, it is indispensable to conduct strict training in standard operating procedure of data collection prior to trail. Researchers will record the case report form (CRF) tables according to participants&#x2019; questionnaires to collect data. CRF cannot be casually modified. Any modification needs explanation and should ensure that original record is not covered. The researcher should sign name and date beside the modification. Data in CRF will then be input on an Excel spreadsheet. After verifying accuracy, written CRFs will be locked in cabin and computer files will be stored in a password-protected computer with limited access.</p>

<title>Safety and moxibustion-related adverse events</title>
<p>It has been reported that moxibustion can cause adverse events such as dizziness, itching, burning sensation, blister, redness, keloids and allergic reactions.23 On each visit, participants are required to report any adverse reactions. Researcher should also observe and document specific symptoms, severity, time, treatment methods, results, relationship with moxibustion in CRFs and report to the chief designer. If serious adverse events are induced, researcher must report to research ethics committee within 24 hours. Participants having serious adverse events should be withdrawn from study and be followed up to receive relevant medical treatment until their condition stabilizes. Connection between adverse events and intervention should be investigated and determined.</p>

<sec id="s4i">
<title>Quality control</title>
<p>Researchers will undergo adequate and professional training before the trial, which help us fully understand protocol and follow guidelines for good clinical practice (GCP), to ensure the safety of patients, adherence to the protocol and correctness of moxibustion intervention.

<title>Sample size calculation</title>
<p>According to the clinical results and related literature on the treatment of allergic rhinitis through ginger interposed moxibustion, the sample size was estimated by means of multi-group sample size calculation method. The efficiency of the high-dose group of ginger acupuncture is expected to be 93.3%, the low-dose group is expected to be 89.9%, and the control group is expected to be 27%. Considering a two-sided significance level of 5%, power of 95% and a 20% shedding rate, 33 participants are required with a 1:1:1 group allocation rate. The test level &#x03B1; is set to 0.05&#x002C;and &#x03B2; to 0.1. The calculation process is as follows:</p>
<p>Calculation formula:n=(Z<sub>1-&#x03B1;&#x2019;/2</sub>&#x002B;Z<sub>1-&#x03B2;</sub>)&#x005E;2&#x00D7;[P<sub>1</sub>(1-P<sub>1</sub>)&#x002B; P<sub>2</sub>(1-P<sub>2</sub>)]/(&#x03B4; <sub>ij</sub>&#x005E;2)&#x002C;n=max{n <sub>ij</sub>&#x002C;pairs(I, j)}</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The outcome analyses will employ the intention to treat (ITT) analysis which will be limited to data collected from participants who receive at least one treatment. Missing data will be compensated through the LOCF. The last observation data will act as the final test results. No interim analysis is planned.</p>
<p>Data analysis will be conducted in a blinded pattern by statisticians by the use of SPSS 21.0 statistical software. Descriptive statistics will be displayed for all the baseline variables and outcome measures. Frequency(percentage)will be used for categorical variables such as gender, and mean&#x00B1;SD for continuous variables including age, disease duration, primary and secondary outcome measures.</p>
<p>Comparison of the baseline characteristics will be analyzed by One-way ANOVA test or Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test for continuous variables and &#x03C7;2 test or Fisher&#x2019;s exact test for categorical variables. To compare effectiveness of interventions among three groups, the One-way ANOVA test will be conducted for data with normal distribution and homogeneous variance; The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test will be for abnormally distributed data and ranked data.</p>
<p>To compare same group of multiple time points, for continuous variables with normal distribution, we will use the paired t-test. When variables are not normal distribution, or variance is not homogeneous or variables are ranked data, Friedman rank sum test will be applied. In all statistical tests, two-sided tests will be used and P&#x003C;0.05 means statistically significant.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The ideal therapeutic effect of moxibustion depends on a certain quantity of moxibustion. And the study of the optimal quantity of moxibustion is conducive to improve the therapeutic effect, reduce the loss of moxibustion materials and improve the acceptance of patients. At present, there is no study on the dose-effect relationship of ginger interposed moxibustion in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Thus, the purpose of this study is to preliminarily reveal the dose-response relationship of ginger interposed moxibustion in the treatment of AR, and provide scheme reference for clinical care.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that ginger interposed moxibustion has good clinical efficacy in the treatment of allergic rhinitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and the operation is simple and easy for patients to adhere to. And &#x201C;3 moxa cones&#x201D; and &#x201C;6 moxa cones&#x201D; are the doses most used in studies of dose-effect relationship of moxibustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In this trial, patients will be divided into high-dose moxibustion group (6 moxa cones), low-dose moxibustion group (3 moxa cones) and sham moxibustion group (3 moxa cones). The purpose of setting up sham moxibustion group is to eliminate the placebo effect of moxibustion and verify the effectiveness of moxibustion in the treatment of AR; The two results of high-dose moxibustion group and low-dose moxibustion group will be compared to illustrate the relationship between the quantity and the effect of ginger interposed moxibustion in treating AR.</p>
<p>We expect that moxibustion is effective in the treatment of AR, and the curative effect of high-dose moxibustion group is better than that of low-dose moxibustion group. However, due to the limitation of the objective conditions of the project, this trial will not set more groups of moxibustion volume, so further study should be carried out to test if the curative effect of ginger interposed moxibustion would be positively correlated with the quantities.</p>
