<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Data on COVID-19-related mortality and associated factors from low-resource settings are scarce. This study examined clinical characteristics and factors associated with in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients in Jakarta, Indonesia, from March 2 to July 31, 2020.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This retrospective cohort included all hospitalised patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 in 55 hospitals. We extracted demographic and clinical data, including hospital outcomes (discharge or death). We used Cox regression to examine factors associated with mortality.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Of 4265 patients with a definitive outcome by July 31, 3768 (88&#x0025;) were discharged and 497 (12&#x0025;) died. The median age was 46 years (IQR 32&#x2013;57), 5&#x0025; were children, and 31&#x0025; had at least one comorbidity. Age-specific mortalities were 11&#x0025; (7/61) for &#x003C;5 years; 4&#x0025; (1/23) for 5-9; 2&#x0025; (3/133) for 10-19; 2&#x0025; (8/638) for 20-29; 3&#x0025; (26/755) for 30-39; 7&#x0025; (61/819) for 40-49; 17&#x0025; (155/941) for 50-59; 22&#x0025; (132/611) for 60-69; and 34&#x0025; (96/284) for &#x2265;70. Risk of death was associated with higher age; pre-existing hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic kidney disease or liver disease; clinical diagnosis of pneumonia; multiple (&#x003E;3) symptoms; and shorter time from symptom onset to admission. Patients &#x003C;50 years with &#x003E;1 comorbidity had a nearly six-fold higher risk of death than those without (adjusted hazard ratio 5&#x00B7;50, 95&#x0025; CI 2&#x00B7;72-11&#x00B7;13; 27&#x0025; vs 3&#x0025; mortality).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>Overall mortality was lower than reported in high-income countries, probably due to younger age distribution and fewer comorbidities. However, deaths occurred across all ages, with &#x003E;10&#x0025; mortality among children &#x003C;5 years and adults &#x003E;50 years.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly around the world since it was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Current understanding of COVID-19 mortality mostly comes from clinical epidemiological studies conducted in the early phase of the pandemic in China [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and in high-income countries of North America [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Europe [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Severe outcomes of COVID-19 in those settings have been consistently associated with older age and pre-existing chronic conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiac disease, chronic kidney disease, and liver disease [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
<p>However, most cases to date have occurred in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], where differences in age distribution, comorbidities, access to quality health services, and other factors, may greatly influence trends regarding severe outcomes, but data are limited [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country (population 274 million) and the LMIC that has suffered the highest number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths in Southeast Asia, second only to India in Asia [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since the first two laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported on March 2, 2020, Indonesia has reported a total of 478 720 cases and 15 503 deaths (3&#x00B7;2&#x0025; confirmed case fatality rate) up to November 18, 2020 [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], with the highest numbers of reported cases (25&#x0025;, 121 818) and deaths (16&#x0025;, 2470) in the capital city of Jakarta. COVID-19 cases and deaths in Jakarta rapidly escalated during the first two months of the outbreak (March-April 2020), and have steadily trended upward through November 2020 [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Indonesia has high burdens of major infectious diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and other tropical infections [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as well as non-communicable diseases, with an estimated 73&#x0025; of deaths caused predominantly by cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic pulmonary diseases, diabetes, and others [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As in many LMIC, substantial proportions of the population face barriers in accessing quality health care services due to under-resourced and fragile health systems [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], often leaving underlying chronic comorbidities unrecognised and/or poorly managed [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These factors may aggravate chronic non-communicable diseases and worsen COVID-19 patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Studies of COVID-19-related mortality in Asia [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and in particular from low-resource settings have been limited. Given that several major urban centres of Southeast Asia like Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Ho Chi Minh City, and Kuala Lumpur, have thus far been spared major COVID-19 epidemics, the explosive epidemic in Jakarta can provide insights directly relevant to similar settings in other LMIC. To this end, we analysed the complete clinical epidemiological surveillance data from the Jakarta Health Office, reporting on admissions to 55 COVID-19-designated hospitals within the city, during the first five months of the epidemic (March through July 2020).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study design and participants</title>
<p>This was a retrospective cohort study to assess demographic and clinical factors associated with mortality of adults and children hospitalised with COVID-19 in Jakarta, Indonesia. The study population included all PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients recorded by the Jakarta Health Office who either died or were discharged alive between March 2 and July 31, 2020. In accordance with Indonesia&#x2019;s national COVID-19 guidelines [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was conducted on mouth and/or throat swab specimens in COVID-19 reference laboratories, and patients were discharged from hospital after two consecutive PCR-negative tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The study data were extracted from the Jakarta Health Office official COVID-19 epidemiological investigation form. In-hospital mortality was duly reported by the surveillance officer at each hospital. Data regarding dates of onset of illness, SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, hospital admission, and outcomes (discharge or death) were recorded, along with age, sex, symptoms, comorbidities, and some critical indicators (e.g. immediate admission to intensive care unit). Comorbidities were recorded at admission by attending clinical staff, either based on clinical assessments or patient reporting. Fever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 38&#x00B0;C [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia (indicative of lower respiratory tract involvement) was established by the treating physician, based on clinical and radiological evaluation [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics included proportions for categorical variables and medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous variables. We calculated time in days from symptom onset to hospital admission, and length of hospital stay until death or discharge. We used the Mann-Whitney U test, &#x03C7;<sup>2</sup> test, or Fisher&#x2019;s exact test to compare characteristics between deceased and discharged patients. Graphs of Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard function were done to compare time-dependent mortality risks based on demographic and clinical risk factors. We used univariable and multivariable Cox regression models to determine the risk of death, expressed as hazard ratio with 95&#x0025; confidential intervals. All independent variables with p-value &#x003C;0.10 in univariable analysis were included in the multivariable models. Final model selection was informed by likelihood ratio tests. No imputations were made for missing data, and because of the high proportion of missing data for obesity (53&#x0025;) this variable was not included in regression analysis. We reported two final multivariable Cox models. In the first model, we assessed the effect of each type of comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, chronic kidney disease and liver disease), and, in the second model, the number of comorbidities (0, 1 or &#x003E;1), along with other demographic and clinical factors. We used interaction terms to examine potential effect modification by age and sex. We confirmed the statistical assumptions were met for proportional hazards analysis. We set statistical significance at 0&#x00B7;05, and all tests were two sided. All analyses were done in Stata/IC 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). This study is reported as per Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Between March 2 and July 31, 2020, a total of 21 397 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases were recorded by the Jakarta Health Office (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Of those, 4522 (21&#x0025;) were admitted to hospital because of symptomatic disease and 4265 (94&#x0025;) had reached a definitive outcome no later than July 31, 2020, i.e. deceased or discharged, and were therefore included in this analysis. There were 257 (6&#x0025;) who were still hospitalised. The study flow chart and completeness of key data are presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the characteristics of the 4265 patients included in the analysis. The median age was 46 years (IQR 32-57, range 0&#x00B7;1-99), 217 (5&#x0025;) were children, and 2217 (52&#x0025;) were men. The most common presenting symptom was cough (66&#x0025;, 2788), followed by fever (53&#x0025;, 2192), malaise (35&#x0025;, 1460), shortness of breath (32&#x0025;, 1335), and others (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The median number of symptoms was 3 (IQR 2-5, range 1-12), 1458 (39&#x0025;) patients had more than three symptoms. We found a moderate degree of overlap between the three most common symptoms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Overall, 31&#x0025; (1299) of patients had a record of one or more pre-existing comorbidities, including hypertension (19&#x0025;, 795), diabetes mellitus (12&#x0025;, 501), cardiac disease (10&#x0025;, 392), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4&#x0025;, 178), chronic kidney disease (3&#x0025;, 108), and others (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). There was little overlap between the three most common comorbidities (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). There were 1488 (37&#x0025;) patients with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. Among 3214 patients with complete records, 102 (3&#x0025;) patients were directly admitted to ICU, and among 3211 patients with complete records, 55 (2&#x0025;) were intubated for mechanical ventilation upon admission.</p>

<p>Of 4265 patients with a known outcome, 497 (12&#x0025;) had died, and 3768 (88&#x0025;) were discharged alive. 36 (7&#x0025;) deceased patients had been declared dead at hospital arrival and were censored from the Cox analysis. The highest numbers of deaths were observed between March 28 and April 4, 2020 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The median time from symptom onset to admission was 6 days (IQR 3-12) overall, 5 days (IQR 3-8) among deceased patients, and 6 days (IQR 3-12) among those discharged. The median length of hospital stay was 24 days (IQR 13-36) overall, 6 days (IQR 2-11) among deceased patients, and 26 days (IQR 18-38) among survivors.</p>

<p>Compared to discharged patients, deceased patients were older (median 58 vs 44 years); more likely to be men (14&#x0025; vs 10&#x0025;); more likely to have presenting symptoms of cough, fever, malaise, shortness of breath, headache, nausea/vomiting, chills, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and &#x003E;3 symptoms (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); more likely to have a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia (68&#x0025; vs 33&#x0025;); to be directly admitted to intensive care (16&#x0025; vs 2&#x0025;); to receive mechanical ventilation at admission (11&#x0025; vs 0&#x00B7;6&#x0025;); and more likely to have a history of any comorbidity (62&#x0025; vs 27&#x0025;), 1 comorbidity (30&#x0025; vs 19&#x0025;) or &#x003E;1 comorbidities (32&#x0025; vs 8&#x0025;), specifically hypertension (42&#x0025; vs 16&#x0025;), diabetes (29&#x0025; vs 10&#x0025;), cardiac disease (22&#x0025; vs 8&#x0025;), chronic kidney disease (9&#x0025; vs 2&#x0025;), and liver disease (2&#x0025; vs 0&#x00B7;6&#x0025;) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Although a large majority of deaths (78&#x0025;, 383) was 50 years or older, death occurred across all age groups. Age-specific mortalities were 11&#x0025; (7/61) for 0-4 years; 4&#x0025; (1/23) for 5-9 years; 2&#x0025; (3/133) for 10-19 years; 3&#x0025; (8/638) for 20-29 years; 3&#x0025; (26/755) for 30-39 years; 7&#x0025; (61/819) for 40-49 years; 16&#x0025; (155/941) for 50-59 years; 22&#x0025; (132/611) for 60-69 years; 34&#x0025; (96/284) for &#x2265;70 years (<xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the seven children below 5 years who died with COVID-19, four (57&#x0025;) were boys, with an age range of 0 to 3 years; four (57&#x0025;) had a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, four (67&#x0025;) had &#x003E;3 symptoms at presentation (1 unknown), two (29&#x0025;) had a known underlying condition (i.e. cardiac disease and immunocompromised status), and two (29&#x0025;) were directly admitted to ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five (71&#x0025;) died within a week after admission. Further details on the clinical course, disease management, underlying conditions and the exact cause of death were not available for this analysis.</p>
<p>The mortality increased by age and number of pre-existing comorbidities (Supplementary Figure 1). The mortality for the age group &#x003C;50 years was 5&#x0025; (110/2372) overall, 3&#x0025; (59/1945) for those without any comorbidity, 8&#x0025; (25/331) for those with 1 comorbidity, and 27&#x0025; (26/96) for those with &#x003E;1 comorbidities; for the age group 50-59 years 16&#x0025; (146/2372), 11&#x0025; (56/515), 18&#x0025; (42/231), and 32&#x0025; (48/151), respectively; for the age group 60-69 years 22&#x0025; (132/601), 16&#x0025; (47/286), 25&#x0025; (46/181), and 29&#x0025; (39/134), respectively; and for the age group &#x2265;70 years 34&#x0025; (95/278), 21&#x0025; (22/103), 33&#x0025; (31/93), and 51&#x0025; (42/82), respectively.</p>
<p>The cumulative incidence of death suggested that almost all deaths occurred within 30 days of admission and differed by demographic and clinical factors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In univariable Cox analysis (<xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), the risk of death was associated with older age, sex, number of pre-existing comorbidities, hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, number of presenting symptoms, pneumonia, immediate ICU admission and intubation, calendar period of admission, and duration from symptom onset to hospital admission.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This retrospective hospital-based study described the complete epidemiological surveillance data of the Jakarta Health Office, including 4265 adults and children with confirmed COVID-19 admitted in 55 COVID-19-designated referral hospitals, during the first five months of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. This analysis represents the largest patient series hospitalised with COVID-19 in Southeast Asia, and one of the largest from LMIC to date. The observed disease pattern broadly reflects that reported globally, with patients usually presenting with multiple symptoms of fever, cough, malaise and/or shortness of breath, and nearly 40&#x0025; having a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia at admission. Overall mortality was 12&#x0025; (497/4265), and deaths occurred across all ages. Although the majority (57&#x0025;) of all admissions were younger than 50 years, including 5&#x0025; children, the large majority (78&#x0025;) of people who died were 50 years or older. Mortality increased with age, from 7&#x0025; in patients aged 40-49 years to 34&#x0025; in patients aged &#x2265;70 years. Mortality among children below 5 years was unexpectedly high at 11&#x0025; (7/61), which has not been reported elsewhere, although available information on any underlying conditions and the exact cause of death of those children was incomplete. Elevated risk of in-hospital death was independently associated with higher age, history of hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic kidney disease, or liver disease, pneumonia, multiple (&#x003E;3) symptoms at presentation, and shorter (&#x2264;7) duration between symptom onset and hospital admission. The increased risk of in-hospital death associated with advancing age was further augmented by the presence of one or more chronic comorbidities, which were recorded to be present in 31&#x0025; of patients.</p>
<p>The overall COVID-19-related mortality in Jakarta (12&#x0025;) was substantially lower than those reported in high-income countries, for example, in the US (21&#x0025;) [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the UK (26&#x0025;) [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but those populations were substantially older, with more comorbidities and more frequent presentation with severe disease. By contrast, a nationwide analysis of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in China reported an overall mortality of just 3&#x00B7;1&#x0025;, but in that population, severe cases and comorbidities were relatively infrequent, while the median age was similar to Jakarta [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Compared with other settings, we found age-specific mortality rates in Jakarta to be similar for patients &#x003C;50 years (5&#x0025; in Jakarta, 5&#x0025; in the US [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and 4&#x0025; in the UK [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]), but slightly lower for patients &#x2265;50 years (21&#x0025; in Jakarta, 27&#x0025; in the US [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and 29&#x0025; in the UK [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Given that older age has been consistently associated with severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19 [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the lower median age (46 years) in Jakarta compared to studies from North America and Europe probably accounts for most of the differences observed in overall in-hospital mortality. The younger age at admission is likely to be mainly related to a younger age distribution in the general population in Jakarta, compared to Europe, the US, and China. Nonetheless, we do not dismiss distinct behavioural factors related to risk of infection, for example adherence to preventive measures, mobility, and health seeking, as also reported in India [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
<p>National surveillance data in Indonesia to date reported a case fatality rate in children aged 0-5 years of 1.0&#x0025; (123/11 916) [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is much higher than a case fatality rate of 0&#x00B7;16&#x0025; in children below 5 years of age in a recent large epidemiological study in Southern India [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Several other studies in China [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], Brazil [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], Uganda [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and South Africa [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have reported COVID-19-related deaths among children under 5 years to be rare. A review of data from US, Korea and Europe early in the epidemic estimated the overall case fatality rate among children (0-19 years old) to be low at 0&#x00B7;03 per 100 000 (44/42 846) [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although children appear generally less severely affected than older individuals [<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], COVID-19 in children can also be characterized by rapid progressive deterioration leading to death, especially in children with comorbidities. Notably, increasing reports from both high-income and LMIC have described a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, which can lead to serious illness [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; to date, to our knowledge, no such cases have been reported in Indonesia. Factors that explain the high mortality observed among children in Jakarta hospitals may be various, including treatment delays, limited paediatric intensive care capacity, presence of underlying conditions, such as malignancy or malnutrition, among other factors. Further investigations are planned to confirm the extent and cause of death among young children with COVID-19 in Jakarta.</p>
<p>Evidence from previous studies suggests that underlying comorbidities, including pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, were associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Chronic comorbidities among COVID-19 patients were less frequent in Jakarta (31&#x0025; of patients) than reported in large patient series in North America [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], South America [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and Europe [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This could reflect the relatively young population admitted to Jakarta hospitals, but also under-reporting of comorbidities by patients, or under-diagnosis due to variable access to quality health services. Presence of one or more comorbidities, especially pre-existing hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic kidney disease or liver disease strongly increased the risk of death in Jakarta, by 40&#x0025;, 60&#x0025;, 70&#x0025; and 300&#x0025;, respectively, compared to those without such comorbidities. These findings were consistent with similar studies elsewhere [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, similar to a study in the US [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we found no association between diabetes and mortality in Jakarta, whereas studies in China [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the UK [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] did so. Obesity has also been recognised as an important risk factor of mortality [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but we could not assess that for lack of complete data.</p>
<p>In Jakarta, the median time from symptom onset to death (median 11 days) was shorter than reported in hospital-based studies from Japan (17 days) [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], China (18&#x00B7;5 days) [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and the US (12&#x00B7;7 days) [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; the relatively short in-hospital trajectory towards clinical deterioration and death (median 6 days) could suggest possible delays in hospital admission and treatment. Among survivors, the length of hospital stay was much longer (median 26 days) than reported in other studies [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which is most likely due to the requirement of two consecutive PCR-negative test results prior to discharge, with results delayed due to limited PCR testing capacity in Jakarta during the early phase of the epidemic.</p>
<p>This study had some limitations. The retrospective design and reliance on routine hospital surveillance data meant that, for some key baseline variables, data were incomplete or uniformly unavailable (e.g. vital signs, TB and HIV co-infection, radiology examination, routine laboratory results). Comorbidities were often self-reported or could be under-diagnosed, potentially resulting in underreporting and hence underestimation of effect sizes. Details on supportive care and treatment received, particularly respiratory support and management of secondary infections, were also not available for this analysis. Findings from hospitals reported here may not reflect the mortality rate and risk factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality in the general population.</p>
<p>In conclusion, risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality in Jakarta, Indonesia are broadly similar to those in more developed settings in North America, Europe, and Asia, dominated by advanced age and comorbidities. Lower overall mortality in Jakarta was likely driven by the lower median age of the hospital population. While children represented just 5&#x0025; of admissions, the 11&#x0025; mortality that occurred among children below 5 years should prompt further investigation of them as potentially highly vulnerable in LMIC settings. The findings highlight the need for enhanced context-specific public health action to reduce infection risk among vulnerable populations and improved care and treatment for the diseased.</p>
