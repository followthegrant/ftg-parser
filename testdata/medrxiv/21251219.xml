<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The factors involved in the persistence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are unknown. We evaluated the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in personnel from 10 healthcare facilities and its association with individuals&#x2019; characteristics and COVID-19 symptoms in an observational study. We enrolled 4735 subjects (corresponding to 80&#x0025; of all personnel) over a period of 5 months when the spreading of the virus was drastically reduced. For each participant, we determined the rate of antibody increase or decrease over time in relation to 93 features analyzed in univariate and multivariate analyses through a machine learning approach. In individuals positive for IgG (&#x2265; 12 AU/mL) at the beginning of the study, we found an increase [<italic>p= 0</italic>.<italic>0002</italic>] in antibody response in symptomatic subjects, particularly with anosmia/dysgeusia (OR 2.75, 95&#x0025; CI 1.753 &#x2013; 4.301), in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. This may be linked to the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the olfactory bulb.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is becoming clear that the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 can last at least 6 months in symptomatic patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, but it seems to decline in asymptomatics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Similarly, a reduction of antibody response in asymptomatic individuals was shown in a study with a fewer number of individuals (n = 37) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The antibody response in COVID-19 patients is associated with the establishment of a memory B cell response which is higher at 6 months <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, however, it is not clear whether there are features that correlate with this sustained B cell response. We previously showed that an anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological analysis allowed us to follow the diffusion of the virus within healthcare facilities in areas differently hit by the virus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. At 5 months of distance, we analyzed the duration of this antibody response and evaluated whether there were features correlating with maintenance, reduction or increase of the antibody response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We assessed the correlation of the rate of antibody increase or decrease with the different analyzed features. In <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref> are reported the rates for individual classes of features with relative statistical analysis. As shown, in the 5 months of observation, females sustained the antibody response better than males (<italic>p = 0</italic>.<italic>01</italic>); similarly non-medical healthcare professionals (specifically, healthcare partner operators) had higher antibody rates (<italic>p = 0</italic>.<italic>0009</italic>). The levels of antibodies increased in hospitals located in the Bergamo area (Castelli and Gavazzeni <italic>p &#x003C; 0</italic>.<italic>0001</italic>) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) which was more hit by COVID-19 (37 &#x2013; 43&#x0025; of individuals with IgG &#x2265; 12)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. More important, the IgG rate in individuals which were positive for IgG (IgG &#x2265; 12 AU/mL; n = 613) at the beginning of the study was increased (<italic>p&#x003C;0</italic>.<italic>000001</italic>) over time, and this increase was either minor in asymptomatics (n = 91, <italic>p</italic> = 0.00003) and paucisymptomatics (n = 203) or strong in symptomatics (n = 319, <italic>p = 0</italic>.<italic>0006</italic>) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). On the contrary, those that had an intermediate IgG titer (3.8 &#x003C; IgG &#x003C; 12 AU/mL considered as negative) displayed all a significant reduction in IgG rate (<italic>p &#x003C; 0</italic>.<italic>000001</italic>) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This may be due to a noise in test analysis as these subjects are considered as negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG according to manufacturer. Many symptoms, including fever, cough, muscle pain, asthenia, tachycardia and anosmia/dysgeusia, correlated with an increase of antibodies in the 5-month observation period (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>As we noticed that the distribution of the rate feature presented a high value of kurtosis (see methods) we restricted the data set to subjects with IgG rates either below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile [&#x003C; &#x2212;0.033 (n = 454)] or above the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile [&#x003E; 0.005 (n = 445)] to prevent a bias-variance problem in machine learning models. The accuracy of these rates was confirmed by a linear regression analysis. In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> are shown the regression diagnostic plots of predicted values against residuals of training and test data according to the threshold (&#x003C; &#x2212;0.033 AU/ml&#x002A;day and &#x003E; 0.005 AU/ml&#x002A;day). In <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> is shown the Chi-squared analysis for the populations below or above the set threshold rates. We found that as for the previous analysis, males reduced the level of antibodies more than females, even though this difference was no longer statistically significant (<italic>p = 0</italic>.<italic>06</italic>). The levels of antibodies increased in hospitals located in the Bergamo area (Castelli and Gavazzeni: <italic>p = 0</italic>.<italic>0032</italic> and <italic>p = 0</italic>.<italic>0005</italic>, respectively) which was more hit by COVID-19 (37 &#x2013; 43&#x0025; of individuals with IgG &#x2265; 12) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> while it decreased in Humanitas Rozzano (<italic>p=0</italic>.<italic>0806</italic>) which was less heavily hit (10&#x0025; of individuals with IgG &#x2265; 12) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The rate decreased in asymptomatic (65&#x0025; of subjects fell in the group &#x003C; &#x2212;0.033; <italic>p &#x003C; 0</italic>.<italic>000001</italic>), remained constant in paucisymptomatic and increased in symptomatic individuals (62&#x0025; of subjects were in the group &#x003E; 0.005; <italic>p &#x003C;0</italic>.<italic>000001</italic>) (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, among the different symptoms, fever, cough, muscle pain, asthenia, dyspnea, tachycardia, chest pain and anosmia/dysgeusia all correlated with a higher number of individuals falling into the group with rate &#x003E; 0.005, indicating that these symptoms were strongly associated with sustained/increased antibody response (<italic>0</italic>.<italic>000001</italic> &#x003C; <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; <italic>0</italic>.<italic>05</italic>, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Among these, anosmia/dysgeusia was associated with the highest percentage of subjects presenting with increased IgG rate (69&#x0025;; <italic>p &#x003C; 0</italic>.<italic>000001</italic>, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Having observed differences according to sex, role and site, and since many symptoms are linked, we performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis based in a machine learning approach (see methods). We performed a Bagging classifier of 7 logistic analysis on a training (Accuracy = 76.26; ROC AUC = 76.30; Recall = 81.14) and a test dataset (Accuracy = 72.00; ROC AUC = 72.12; Recall = 81.08). In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref> is shown the multivariate logistic regression analysis. We found that the increased rate was associated primarily with anosmia/dysgeusia (regression coefficient=1.0, 95&#x0025; CI 0.56 &#x2013; 1.46) and with chest pain (regression coefficient=0.84, 95&#x0025; CI 0.24 &#x2013; 1.44), while the decreased rate was associated to subjects with intermediate IgG (3.8 &#x003C; IgG &#x003C; 12) (regression coefficient = &#x2212;1.61, 95&#x0025; CI &#x2212;2.03 &#x2013; &#x2212;1.0), which may be related to a noise in the instrument testing, and with past neoplasia (regression coefficient = &#x2212;1.38, 95&#x0025; CI &#x2212;2.4 &#x2013; &#x2212;0.37). Interestingly, 54&#x0025; of subjects with chest pain also presented loss of smell/taste while only 22&#x0025; of subjects with smell/taste dysfunction also had chest pain, suggesting that IgG increase in the symptomatic population is primarily linked to anosmia and dysgeusia (not shown). In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1d</xref> are shown the odds ratio relative to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1c</xref>, which for chest pain is 2.32 (95&#x0025; CI 1.27 &#x2013; 4.24), for anosmia/dysgeusia is 2.75 (95&#x0025; CI 1.75 &#x2013; 4.30), for subjects with intermediate IgG (3.8 &#x003C; IgG &#x003C; 12) is 0.2 (95&#x0025; CI 0.13 &#x2013; 0.30) and for subjects with past neoplasia is 0.25 (95&#x0025; CI 0.09 &#x2013; 0.69). Overall, these results indicate that although many symptoms are associated with an increase of IgG abundance in the observation time, only anosmia/dysgeusia and chest pain are associated to a higher IgG rate in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. By contrast the population with past neoplasia or intermediate levels of IgG (3.8 &#x003C; IgG &#x003C; 12 AU/mL) are the one that display a reduction in IgG.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We analyzed the 5-month duration of an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in personnel from 9 healthcare facilities and an international medical school (Humanitas University) in Northern Italy in areas differently hit by the virus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. We show that the antibody response is stable both in symptomatic and asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic individuals and is increased in females and in non-medical healthcare professionals. Previously, it has been shown in a study conducted in the British population that the antibody response declines of nearly 22&#x0025; in symptomatic individuals and of 64&#x0025; in asymptomatic individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. However, this study was based on a prick qualitative test and thus the decline may be related to the sensitivity of the test. We also observed that the antibody response declined when we analyzed the group (3.8 &#x003C; IgG &#x003C; 12 AU/mL) with IgG between the limit of detection (3.8 AU/mL) and the threshold of positivity (IgG &#x2265; 12 AU/mL), as set by manufacturer. Whether this is linked to a noise of the instrument that may change according to the test or to a real reduction in an antibody response that may or may not be specific to SARS-CoV-2, remains to be established. When we analyzed the extremes, i.e. the individuals with higher rates of antibody increase or decrease (&#x003C; &#x2212;0.033 and &#x003E; 0.005 AU/mL&#x002A;day) we observed that asymptomatics had higher negative rates while symptomatics tended to continue increasing the antibody levels suggesting that extreme changes in rate separate the symptomatics from the asymptomatics. As during the observation time there was very limited viral diffusion in Northern Italy, as confirmed also by the finding that only 2 individuals became IgG positive and 2981 remained IgG negative throughout the study (all excluded from the analysis), we can conclude that the sustained or augmented antibody response may not be linked to a re-exposure to the virus. In an attempt to address what improved the antibody response, we found that several symptoms were associated to increased rates of antibodies, however, in a multivariate logistic analysis only anosmia/dysgeusia and chest pain were linked with the highest regression coefficients. Chest pain and anosmia are long-lasting symptoms in COVID-19 patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In addition, anosmia and/or dysgeusia are very common as they are found in around 50-70&#x0025; of subjects affected by COVID-19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In our cohort (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), 49&#x0025; of IgG positive subjects had anosmia/dysgeusia, 28&#x0025; chest pain and 13.7&#x0025; both anosmia/dysgeusia and chest pain, suggesting that indeed these two symptoms may, either alone or in combination, associate with IgG increase. We and others previously found that anosmia/dysgeusia together with fever were the symptoms that mostly characterized SARS-CoV-2 exposure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In agreement, anosmia and dysgeusia have been proposed to be used to track SARS-CoV-2 diffusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 can infect the olfactory epithelium <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, including olfactory sensory neurons, support cells and immune cells, that express the viral entry receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Here, the virus can persist long and induce local inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and olfactory bulb abnormalities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In agreement, the loss of smell and taste can persist in individuals even with RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 negativity in the nasopharyngeal swab <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Overall, these data suggest that increased antibody response in patients with anosmia/dysgeusia may be linked to persistence of the virus in the olfactory bulb which through local inflammation and release of antigens, maintains and boosts the antibody response. This study opens new perspectives on the immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and warrants further investigation on the role of anosmia/dysgeusia on antibody response through the design of prospective observational studies coupling the testing of SARS-CoV-2 persistence in the olfactory bulb, loss of smell or taste and antibody titers.</p>

<title>Study population</title>
<p>This observational study has been approved by the international review board of Istituto Clinico Humanitas for all participating institutes (clinicaltrial.gov NCT04387929). Accrual was on a voluntary basis: it started on April 28<sup>th</sup> and more than 80&#x0025; of personnel participated (n = 4735). The study foresees 4 blood collections every 3/4 months. 10 different centers participate: Istituto Clinico Humanitas (ICH), Rozzano (MI); Humanitas Gavazzeni, Bergamo; Humanitas Castelli, Bergamo; Humanitas Mater Domini (HMD), Castellanza (VA); Humanitas Medical Center, HMC, Varese; Humanitas University, Pieve Emanuele (MI); Humanitas San Pio X, Milano; Humanitas Cellini, Torino; Humanitas Gradenigo, Torino; Clinica Fornaca, Torino. All participants signed an informed consent and filled a questionnaire before blood collection. We analyzed 93 features (72 categorical and 17 numerical and 4 temporal) including, age, sex, location, professional role, time between sample collections, COVID-19 symptoms (fever, sore throat, cough, muscle pain, asthenia, anosmia/dysgeusia (loss of smell and taste), gastrointestinal disorders, conjunctivitis, dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia, pneumonia), home exits and smart-working, comorbidities (diabetes, asthma, neoplasia, autoimmunity, cardiovascular disorders, hepatic disorders). After excluding for employees that became positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (n = 2) during the observation period and those that dropped from phase I or for which we were missing at least two features, we analyzed 4534 participants (4.25&#x0025; drop out). Here we show the results of the end of phase II (second blood sampling).</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>IgG measure</title>
<p>For the determination of IgG anti SARS-CoV-2, the Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Saluggia (VC), Italy) was used <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The method is an indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay for the determination of anti-S1 and anti-S2 specific antibodies. According to kit manufacturer, the test discriminates among negative (&#x003C; 12AU/mL; with 3.8 as the limit of IgG detection) and positive (&#x2265; 12.0 AU/mL) subjects. However, we considered also individuals with IgG comprised between 3.8 and 12 AU/mL (which we called IgG med: 3.8 &#x003C; IgG &#x003C; 12.0 AU/mL). Consistency and reproducibility of the antibody test in samples collected in the two time points was confirmed for a limited number of individuals (n = 50) displaying different degrees of IgG positivity.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis and model</title>
<p>We first cleared the dataset by eliminating data from all of those subjects that did not develop an IgG response over time (IgG &#x2264; 3.8 at the beginning and at the end of the examination) (n = 2981). We then analyzed the rate of antibody response defined as:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21251219v1_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Positive rates mean increased antibody response, while negative rates indicate reduction of antibody response between the two analyzed time points.</p>
<p>For statistical analysis, we performed both a univariate and a multivariate analysis. We applied Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistical non-parametric test to compare the antibody rate distribution between classes of subjects (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>We analyzed the distribution of the rate feature and found a high value of kurtosis (461) around the median value of 0.016, hence to perform a multivariate analysis we restricted the data set to subjects with IgG rates either below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile or above the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile to prevent a bias-variance problem in machine learning models and subjected the data to a linear regression analysis between the training and test data sets, where the target variable (rate of antibodies) was standardized using the Yeo-Johnson method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. We then applied Chi-squared statistical test to evaluate differences between classes and the rate thresholds described above (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In order to evaluate the possible interactions between features and the rate of antibody response, we developed a multivariate approach to perform a binary classification between subjects who increased or decreased the level of antibodies. A set of 7 logistic regressions has been applied on data using a bootstrap procedure (samples are drawn with replacement) and the output of each classifier has been averaged by a Bagging classifier to obtain the final output. The selection of hyperparameters of the machine learningmodel and the feature selection has been performed with a Bayesian optimization approach based on cross validation (4 folds, stratified by outcome).</p>
