<title>Summary</title>
<p>In India, the second wave of coronavirus disease (COVID -19) was associated with a distinct surge in cases of invasive fungal infection with mucormycosis. This disease was seen typically in the sinonasal form in COVID-19 patients. Uncontrolled diabetes, steroid use in COVID-19 treatment, etc. were some of the postulated risk factors for the association of COVID 19 and Mucormycosis. The management plan of these cases included surgical debridement, systemic antifungal therapy, sugar control, and management of antifungal related systemic adverse effects. In this retrospective case record review, we aimed to evaluate the airway management plan, demographics, and overall outcomes in patients undergoing surgical resection for COVID-19 associated mucormycosis. Forty-one (71.9 &#x0025;) patients had a diagnosis of sino-nasal mucormycosis, fourteen (24.6&#x0025;) had a diagnosis of rhino-orbital mucormycosis, and 2 patients (3.5&#x0025;) were diagnosed with palatal mucormycosis. Total 44 (77.19 &#x0025;) patients had co-morbidities. The most common co-morbidity was Diabetes Mellitus 42 (73.6&#x0025;), followed by hypertension 21 (36.84&#x0025;) and Acute kidney injury 14 (28.07&#x0025;). We used the intubation difficulty scale score to assess intubating conditions. Intubation was easy to slightly difficult in 53 out of 57 patients. In our study, mortality occurred in 7 (12.28 &#x0025;) patients. The median mortality time was 60 (range, 27-74) days. The median time to hospital discharge was 53.5 (range,10-85) days. Managing COVID-19 on its own is challenging and additional mucormycosis can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Despite challenges and risks, timely and meticulous interventions can reduce complications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mucormycosis is an acute-onset, aggressive, and rapidly progressive angioinvasive infection caused by saprophytic fungi of the order Mucorales. The most common underlying risk factor associated with mucormycosis is uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplants, corticosteroid therapy, neutropenia, or drug-induced immunosuppression are other identifiable risk factors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</p>
<p>There was a sudden increase in cases of mucormycosis in the second wave of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in India. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] The management plan of these cases included surgical debridement, systemic antifungal therapy, sugar control, and management of antifungal related systemic adverse effects. Diabetes mellitus has been identified as the most common coexisting comorbidity. Attention must be given to control blood glucose.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] Also, airway management may be difficult in these patients due to the invasive nature of the disease. The oropharyngeal region may be involved by fungus and edema in the supraglottic area may cause difficult endotracheal intubation and difficult ventilation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] These patients are getting injections of amphotericin B which may have significant adverse effects like nephrotoxicity, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesemia, fever, shivering, dyspnoea, and hypotension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] Moreover, COVID-19 itself has detrimental effects on different organs of the body. Many of these patients require surgical debridement of involved tissues and anaesthesiologists are involved in the multidisciplinary perioperative management of mucormycosis associated with COVID-19.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]</p>
<p>The mortality rate of mucormycosis associated with COVID-19 is unknown but overall mortality in case of mucormycosis is 54&#x0025;.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] There is a risk of involvement of vital structures like the brain and eye, so surgical debridement should be planned on an urgent basis as delay may cause further worsening of prognosis. There may be less time for optimization of patient comorbidities, making perioperative management challenging. As all the patients in our study are positive to COVID-19, the problems encountered due to wearing personal protective equipment, limited staff and supplies are additional difficulties in the management of these patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]</p>
<p>To our knowledge, there has been no study reporting on the anaesthetic management of patients with mucormycosis associated with COVID-19 except for few case reports. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the airway management plan, demographics, and overall outcomes in patients undergoing surgical resection for COVID-19 associated mucormycosis.</p>

<title>Preoperative Procedures</title>
<p>Routine monitoring including heart rate (HR), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), electrocardiogram (ECG), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was administered in the operating room for each patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Anesthetic Management</title>
<p>All the surgeries were performed under general anaesthesia. Following the 3-min preoxygenation with 100&#x0025; O<sub>2</sub>, anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (2 &#x00B5;g/kg), intravenous propofol (2 mg/kg), rocuronium (0.9 mg/kg). In 56 patients, orotracheal intubation by using C-MAC video laryngoscope was performed and in 1 patient, nasotracheal intubation was performed using the fibreoptic bronchoscope. All patients were mechanically ventilated using an Avance CS<sup>2</sup> Anesthesia Delivery System (GE Healthcare) at a frequency of 10-14 breaths per min with a tidal volume of 6-8 mL/kg. Following intubation, the EtCO<sub>2</sub> value was monitored continuously. The tidal volume and the ventilation rate were adjusted to maintain the EtCO<sub>2</sub> value within a range of 35-45 mmHg. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane or desflurane in a mixture of 50&#x0025;-50&#x0025; oxygen and air. A bolus injection of rocuronium was administered as needed. In patients that had no intraoperative complications, neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and glycopyrrolate (1/5 dose of neostigmine) were administered to reverse residual neuromuscular blockade at the end of the surgery. Patients who achieved spontaneous respiration, adequate tidal volume (&#x003E;5 mL/kg), maintaining oxygen saturation &#x003E;95 &#x0025; were extubated in the operation theatre and then transferred to the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU). However, the patients who showed inadequate reversal were transferred to the Intensive care unit (ICU) for elective mechanical ventilation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Procedural Data</title>
<p>Duration of anaesthesia was defined as the time between Induction of anaesthesia to transfer of the patient to the post-anaesthesia care unit PACU or ICU. Patient data regarding length of hospital stay and mortality rates were obtained from the hospital records. Length of hospital stay was defined as days between the date of admission in the hospital to the date of discharge/mortality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>The study reviewed the demographic, surgical, and clinical records of 57 patients. Patient data regarding drugs, comorbidities, and laboratory parameters were obtained from the hospital records.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2i">
<title>Postoperative Management</title>
<p>Postoperative care was conducted in the PACU/ICU. Patients that achieved a Modified Aldrete score of &#x2265; 9 were transferred to the ward. (11). Patients who required postoperative mechanical ventilation were transferred to ICU directly from the operation theatre. Postoperative analgesia was provided according to the world health organization&#x2019;s stepladder approach to pain management.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2j">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data pertaining to selected variables in the study were extracted from the records and entered into MS Excel software version 16.0 (Microsoft Inc.). for summative analysis. The data were summarized using the medians with interquartile ranges [25<sup>th</sup> &#x2013; 75<sup>th</sup>] for continuous variables and numbers and =proportions (&#x0025;) for categorical variables Data were statistically reviewed using IBM SPSS Version 24 (SPSS Inc, Chicago IL, USA). for distribution however it wasn&#x2019;t included in the study for non-comparable groups., Descriptive data were tabulated into contingency tables and was included in the study results.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Demographic characteristics of the patients are presented in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1.1</xref>. The 57 patients comprised 35 (61.4 &#x0025;) men and 22 (38.59 &#x0025;) women with a median age of 49 (range, 26-78) years. The median body weight was 64 (range, 46-82) kg and the median height was 1.67 (range, 1.45-1.81) meters. Eleven patients had an American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score of I (19.29 &#x0025;), 23 patients had an ASA score of II (40.35 &#x0025;), while the remaining 23 patients had a score of III (40.35 &#x0025;).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] Ten (17.54&#x0025;) patients were active smokers and 10 (17.54&#x0025;) patients had a history of alcohol intake. Forty-one (71.9 &#x0025;) patients had a diagnosis of sino-nasal mucormycosis, fourteen (24.6&#x0025;) had a diagnosis of rhino-orbital mucormycosis (out of which 2 patients were diagnosed with rhino-orbital mucormycosis with cerebral extension), and 2 patients (3.5&#x0025;) was diagnosed with palatal mucormycosis. Total 44 (77.19 &#x0025;) patients had co-morbidities. The most common co-morbidity was Diabetes Mellitus 42 (73.6&#x0025;), followed by hypertension 21 (36.84&#x0025;) and Acute kidney injury 14 (28.07&#x0025;).</p>

<p>All patients received crystalloids while 2 patients received blood transfusions. We performed internal jugular venous cannulation in 47 (82.45 &#x0025;) patients and peripherally inserted central catheterization in 7 (12.28&#x0025;) patients. In 3 patients, internal jugular venous cannulation was already performed before their surgery. Nasogastric tube insertion was performed in 19 (33.33&#x0025;) and Foley&#x2019;s catheterization was performed in 19 (33.33&#x0025;) patients. Median blood loss was 150 (range 50-500) ml and median urine output was 250 (range, 200-300) ml. The preoperative investigations are listed in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The median duration of anaesthesia was 150 (range, 90&#x2013;270) min. Forty-one (71.92 &#x0025;) patients were extubated after surgery in the operation theatre. Sixteen (28.07 &#x0025;) patients were shifted to the Intensive care unit for postoperative elective mechanical ventilation. The reason for postoperative elective mechanical ventilation was extensive surgery in 14 patients and inadequate reversal in 2 patients. Eight patients out of 16 were extubated on postoperative day 0, 6 patients were extubated on postoperative day 1, and 2 patients were extubated on day 2. One patient required a high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) after extubation for 10 days, later the patient was weaned off from the HFNC. The median time to hospital discharge was 53.5 (range,10-85) days. Mortality occurred in 7 (12.28 &#x0025;) patients during the hospital stay. The median mortality time was 60 (range, 27-74) days.</p>

<sec id="s4">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Surgical debridement of mucormycosis is an aggressive procedure and perioperative anesthetic management of the patients is challenging. Involvement of the oropharyngeal region by fungus and supraglottic edema may cause mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] In our study, mask ventilation was not difficult in any of our patients. First pass intubation success was 92.98 &#x0025;. Two attempts were taken in 4 (7.01 &#x0025;) patients. Two patients had required intubation stylet for their endotracheal intubation and two patients had difficulty in guiding endotracheal tube through glottis in the first attempt but the second attempt was successful.</p>
<p>In one patient, restricted mouth opening was present, so, fibreoptic intubation was performed. Rest all patients are intubated by C-MAC video laryngoscope as per departmental COVID-19 protocol. The intubation difficulty score was calculated with the help of the Intubation difficulty scale. Eleven patients had no intubation difficulty, 42 patients had slight intubation difficulty (score 1-4), 3 patients had moderate to major intubation difficulty (score &#x003E;5).</p>
<p>We had a dedicated COVID-19 operation theatre with all the healthcare staff wearing level 3 personal protective equipment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] As an anaesthesia, we checked all equipment and drugs for anticipated or unanticipated difficult airway management. We had different sized masks, stylets, bougies, laryngeal mask airways of different sizes, video laryngoscope (C-MAC) with blades of different sizes, fibreoptic-guided intubation kit, 2 working suction apparatus, and emergency tracheostomy trolley for management of the unexpected difficult airway.</p>
<p>COVID-19 itself is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality due to dyspnoea, poor functional status, chest pain or tightness, hypercoagulability, endocrine abnormalities particularly impaired glycaemic control, etc. This, in addition to mucormycosis, leads to even worsening of prognosis in these patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] In our study 42 (73.68 &#x0025;) patients had a history of diabetes which was managed by administration of insulin perioperatively. Central venous catheters may be required peri-operatively for blood or blood product transfusion, fluid replacement, inotropic or vasopressor support, and for infusion of amphotericin B for a prolonged period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]We used Groshong&#x00AE; PICC catheter (4 and 5 Fr) in 7 patients and internal jugular venous cannulation in 47 patients.</p>
<p>The use of systemic amphotericin B in the management of COVID-19 associated mucormycosis has its distinct toxicities, most importantly nephrotoxicity. There are other side effects of amphotericin B such as hypokalaemia, hypomagnesemia, fever, dyspnoea, shivering, and hypotension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] In our study, 14 patients had pre-operative amphotericin B-induced nephrotoxicity. The primary aim of surgical management is to debride all necrotic tissues. Our patients received both antifungal treatment and surgical debridement. The overall mortality of mucormycosis is 54&#x0025;.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] The mortality rate of mucormycosis associated with COVID-19 is still unknown. In our study, mortality occurred in 7 (12.28 &#x0025;) patients. The median mortality time was 60 (range, 27-74) days.</p>
<p>The median (interquartile range) age of patients discharged was 47.5 (41,57.5) days as compared to median (IQR) age of patients expired i.e., 64(47,70) which was statistically significant (P value=0.04]. Five (12.2&#x0025;) patients out of 41 patients with sinonasal mucormycosis and 2 (14.3 &#x0025;) patients out of rhino orbital mucormycosis (out of which 1 had a cerebral extension) expired. No patients with palatal mucormycosis expired. In preoperative investigations, we found D-Dimer levels statistically increased in patients who expired as compared to patients discharged [Median (IQR) &#x27F6;2448 (408,3301) vs 364(213,638)] [P=0.04]. Rest all investigations between discharged and expired patients were comparable.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. First, the study had a retrospective nature and was based on the analysis of anaesthesia and hospital records. Second, all the patients were from a single center. Our study has one strength as this is the first of its kind study in anesthetic perspectives of COVID-19 associated mucormycosis that can be used as a platform for further studies on this topic.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The anesthetic management of mucormycosis associated with COVID-19 is challenging because of its perioperative effects. Managing COVID-19 on its own is difficult and additional mucormycosis can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Despite challenges and risks, timely and meticulous interventions can reduce complications.</p>
