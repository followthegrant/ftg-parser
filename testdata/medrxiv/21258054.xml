<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Prolonged past exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) is associated with exercise limitation. Pulmonary factors including air trapping contribute to this limitation but the contribution of cardiovascular factors is unclear.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>To determine contribution of cardiovascular mechanisms to SHS-associated exercise limitation, we examined the cardiovascular responses to maximum effort exercise testing in 166 never-smokers with remote but prolonged occupational exposure to SHS and no known history of cardiovascular disease except nine with medically-controlled hypertension. We estimated the contribution of oxygen-pulse (proxy for cardiac stroke volume) and changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) and heart rate (HR) over workload towards exercise capacity, and examined whether the association of SHS with exercise capacity was mediated through these variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2Peak</sub>) and oxygen-pulse (O<sub>2</sub>-Pulse<sub>Peak</sub>) at peak exercise were 1,516&#x00B1;431mL/min (100&#x00B1;23 %predicted) and 10.6&#x00B1;2.8mL/beat (117&#x00B1;25 %predicted), respectively, with 91 (55%) and 43 (26%) of subjects not being able to achieve their maximum predicted values. Sixty-two percent showed hypertensive response to exercise by at least one established criterion. In adjusted models, VO<sub>2Peak</sub> was associated directly with O<sub>2</sub>-Pulse and inversely with rise of SBP and DBP over workload (all P&#x003C;0.05). Moreover, SHS exposure association with VO<sub>2Peak</sub> was mainly (84%) mediated through its effect on oxygen-pulse (P&#x003D;0.034). Notably, although not statistically significant, a large proportion (60%) of air trapping effect on VO<sub>2Peak</sub> seemed to be mediated through oxygen-pulse (P&#x003D;0.066).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a never-smoker population with remote prolonged exposure to SHS, abnormal escalation of afterload and an SHS-associated reduction in cardiac output contributed to lower exercise capacity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) remains a major public health problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Although SHS exposure among nonsmokers in the United States has declined from 88% in 1988 to 25% in 2014, the rate of decline has plateaued with one in four nonsmokers, including 14 million children, continue to be exposed to SHS annually between 2011 and 2014.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> This substantial continued exposure is important particularly as the generations that endured the highest amount of SHS exposure are aging, a process which could accentuate the SHS-related health problems that may have been previously too subtle to be recognized.</p>
<p>Although immediate health effects of exposure to SHS have been studied,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> its long-term consequences, particularly the effect of remote exposures, have been more difficult to examine in part due to challenges with exposure assessment. Never-smoking flight crew who worked on commercial aircrafts before the enactment of the smoking ban were exposed to heavy SHS in aircraft cabin for many years, in a range similar to the nicotine exposure burden experienced by &#x201C;light&#x201D; smokers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> The regularity of this intense exposure in the cabin work environment lends itself to relatively accurate SHS exposure quantification through employment history,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and makes the exposed flight crew a unique population in which the long-term health effects of previous exposure to SHS could be examined as a form of &#x201C;natural&#x201D; experiment that is also generalizable to other SHS-exposed populations.</p>
<p>In previous studies of never-smoking flight crew with history of remote but prolonged exposure to SHS in aircraft cabin, we examined the pulmonary health effects of long-term exposure to SHS and showed the association of those outcomes with the number of years during which the flight crew were exposed to SHS in aircraft cabin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> While this never-smoking SHS- exposed cohort had no evidence of spirometric chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (a preserved ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity [FEV1/FVC]), they had abnormal lung function that were suggestive of presence of an occult early/mild obstructive lung disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> In the current study, we wished to examine the cardiovascular health effects of remote but prolonged exposure to SHS in this never-smoking cohort with evidence of early obstructive lung disease. We hypothesized that prolonged exposure to SHS contributes to exercise limitation through its adverse cardiovascular health effects, in addition to its contribution through pulmonary mechanisms (air trapping). To evaluate this hypothesis, we analyzed the cohort&#x2019;s cardiovascular response to maximum effort cardiopulmonary exercise testing.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study Overview</title>
<p>This was a <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis of data collected as part of the Secondhand Smoke Respiratory Health Study, an observational cohort study of nonsmoking subjects with a range of occupational SHS exposure, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Briefly, between July 2007 and July 2015, we recruited US airline flight crewmembers with a history of occupational exposure to SHS, along with nonsmoker controls without such occupational exposure, who were participating in a larger study of cardiopulmonary health effects of prolonged remote exposure to SHS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> The participants were characterized by respiratory symptom questionnaires, full pulmonary function testing (PFT), and a maximum effort cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). We used the data from this cohort to perform a <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis to determine the associations among exercise capacity (volume of oxygen uptake at peak exercise [VO<sub>2Peak</sub>]), cardiovascular responses to maximum effort CPET (oxygen-pulse [O<sub>2</sub>-Pulse; a proxy for cardiac stroke volume], systolic and diastolic blood pressure [SBP and DBP], and heart rate [HR]), years of airline employment during which the subjects worked in smoky cabin (cabin SHS exposure), and their interactions with each other as well as with air trapping (RV/TLC), which we had previously shown to be associated with VO<sub>2Peak</sub>.</p>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>The Secondhand Smoke Respiratory Health Study recruited the US airline flight crewmembers as part of an investigation of the potential adverse health effects of the cabin environment on those employed before and after introduction of the ban on smoking in U.S. commercial aircraft. Crewmembers were eligible to participate in the study if they had worked &#x2265;5 years in aircraft. A referent group of &#x201C;sea-level&#x201D; subjects who lived in San Francisco Bay area and had never been employed as airline crewmembers were also recruited. All subjects were nonsmokers defined by never-smoking or, in ever smokers, no smoking for &#x2265;20 years and a cumulative history of smoking &#x003C;20 pack-years. Subjects with known history of pulmonary (such as asthma or COPD) or cardiovascular disease (such as coronary artery disease or heart failure) were excluded. Subjects with known history of hypertension were included if their blood pressure was medically controlled as defined by SBP&#x2264;150 and DBP&#x2264;90 at the time of visit. Overall, out of the 179 subjects who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), 166 subjects were included in this analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UCSF Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the San Francisco VA Medical Center Committee on Research and Development approved study protocols. Written IRB-approved informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) were obtained from all study participants. Subjects received monetary compensation for their participation in the study.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>SHS Exposure Characterization</title>
<p>SHS exposure was characterized by a questionnaire developed by the UCSF Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI) Center of Excellence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and modified to acquire information on airline-related occupational history, as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Briefly, this included employer airlines, duration of employment, and flight routes with quantification of &#x201C;cabin SHS exposure&#x201D; as the number of years during which the crewmembers were exposed to SHS in aircraft. Other possible sources of SHS exposure were also explored by questioning subjects about their non-cabin exposures in additional settings, as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Pulmonary Function Testing</title>
<p>Pulmonary function studies were conducted according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Routine pulmonary function tests were performed in the seated position using a model Vmax 229 CareFusion (CareFusion Corp., Yorba Linda, CA) and nSpire body plethysmograph (nSpire Health Inc., Longmont, CO) as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> This included measurement spirometry including flows low lung volumes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>; lung volume by single breath dilution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and plethysmography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>; airway resistance during panting at functional residual capacity (FRC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>; and single breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> Bronchodilator responsiveness was not performed. Hyperinflation and air trapping, which is inferred from an increase in FRC or residual volume (RV), was quantified using FRC or RV to total lung capacity (TLC) ratio (FRC/TLC or RV/TLC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing</title>
<p>Subjects performed physician-supervised, symptom-limited, progressively increasing exercise tests in the supine position on an electromagnetically braked, supine cycle ergometer (Medical Positioning Inc. Kansas City, MO). The protocol consisted of 3-min rest, 1-min unloaded (freewheeling) cycling at 60 to 65 revolution per minute (rpm), followed by increasing work rate of 20 to 40 Watts at 2-minute intervals (stages) to a maximum tolerated, and 5-min of recovery. Subjects were encouraged to give their best effort, and during testing, were encouraged to continue exercise until a VO<sub>2</sub> plateau effect on a breath-to-breath analysis of oxygen consumption was visually observed; however, they were advised that they could stop voluntarily at any time they believed they could not continue.</p>
<p>Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR), and oxyhemoglobin saturation by pulse oximetry (O<sub>2</sub>sat) were monitored continuously, and blood pressure (BP) (measured manually by a physician with a cuff) was recorded every 2 min during the second minute of each stage. Minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>), oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon dioxide output (VCO<sub>2</sub>) were measured breath-by-breath with an open-circuit metabolic cart (model Vmax 229, CareFusion, Yorba Linda, CA). Immediately before all tests, the gas analyzers were calibrated using reference gases of known concentrations and the ventilometer was calibrated using a 3-liter syringe (Hans Rudolph, Kansas, MO). The metabolic system was verified using four trained technicians who provided monthly exercise values as biological standards for the Laboratory.</p>
<p>Peak exercise gas exchange variables (VO<sub>2</sub>, VCO<sub>2</sub>, and V<sub>E</sub>) were estimated as the last 30- second average value obtained during the highest stage of the exercise test that subject was able to complete, as defined by continuous cycling at the required 60 to 65 rpm during that stage for greater than 1 minute. The volumes of the flow meter, mouthpiece, and filter (70 mL x breathing frequency) were subtracted from VE for the V<sub>E</sub>/VCO<sub>2</sub> calculations. Anaerobic threshold (AT) was determined by the V-slope method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The subject&#x2019;s perception of level of effort and exertion, breathlessness, and fatigue was documented during the second minute of every stage using the modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (Borg), the Category-Ratio Scale anchored at number 10 (CR10).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Respiratory Symptom Scoring</title>
<p>Respiratory symptoms were assessed using modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and another self-reported questionnaire (UCSF FAMRI Center of Excellence questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>) that elicited symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and subjects&#x2019; perception of a decreased level of exertion compared to peers over the year preceding enrollment. A dichotomous indicator of respiratory symptoms was defined by mMRC &#x2265;1 or report of at least one respiratory symptom on the FAMRI questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Percent predicted as well as lower and upper limits of normal (LLN and ULN) values for measures of Spirometry and lung volumes at rest and cardiopulmonary responses to exercise were calculated using Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI), Quanjer et al., and Wasserman predicted formulas, repectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Distributions of subject characteristics, pulmonary function, cardiopulmonary exercise, and SHS exposure quantification variables were examined. Changes in HR, SBP, DBP, and O<sub>2</sub>- Pulse with respect to the workload were approximated by estimating the slopes from linear regression modeling of the measures over workload at each stage. Peak cardiopulmonary exercise variables were estimated using the last 30-second average values obtained during the highest stage of the exercise test as described above.</p>
<p>Associations between exercise capacity (VO<sub>2Peak</sub>) and each of the cardiovascular outputs (including SBP, DBP, and O<sub>2</sub>-Pulse) were examined in univariate linear regression models with adjustment for covariates (age, sex, height, and BMI unless noted otherwise) and the baseline value of the respected variable. Similarly, associations between presence of respiratory symptoms (mMRC) and each of the cardiovascular outputs were examined in univariate logistic regression models with adjustment for covariates. Additionally, associations between each of the cardiovascular outputs (SBP, DBP, and O<sub>2</sub>-Pulse) and baseline air trapping (FRC/TLC or RV/TLC) as a pulmonary factor affecting exercise capacity and cardiovascular outputs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and SHS exposure were examined using linear regression models.</p>
<p>The cardiovascular variables that were statistically significant predictor of exercise capacity (VO<sub>2Peak</sub>) (or respiratory symptoms [mMRC]) were then used in comprehensive regression models with inclusion of all relevant cardiovascular outputs, air trapping (FRC/TLC or RV/TLC), and SHS exposure as predictors to examine their association with VO<sub>2Peak</sub> and mMRC while accounting for the interrelationships among the predictors.</p>
<p>To assess whether associations between VO<sub>2Peak</sub> (or mMRC) and SHS exposure or air trapping (FRC/TLC or RV/TLC) were mediated through cardiovascular outputs, we performed mediation analyses with VO<sub>2Peak</sub> (or mMRC) (dependent variable), SHS exposure or air trapping (independent variable), and cardiovascular outputs (mediator variables), with inclusion of covariates using the &#x201C;mediation&#x201D; package in R.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> To assess robust estimations, the bootstrap method with 1000 resamples from the data was applied to obtain the estimated proportion of mediation and the corresponding P-value.</p>
<p>For each analysis, the total number of subjects who had complete set of data for that analysis was reported along with the results from the regression modeling or mediation analysis.</p>

<title>Subject Characteristics</title>
<p>The characteristics of the 166 participants included in this analysis are shown in <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>. The subjects were predominantly women (150 [90%]). All were never-smokers (&#x003C;100 cigarettes lifetime) with the exception of one who had smoked 0.7 pack-years. All subjects had exposure to SHS with 63% and 35% reporting childhood and adult home SHS exposure, respectively. Ninety (54%) had been exposed to cabin SHS during their airline employment for an average of 16.8&#x00B1;8.8 years (median [IQR] &#x003C;total range&#x003E; of 18 [10-24] &#x003C;1-31&#x003E; years). None of the subjects included in the analysis reported any history of cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases with the exception of nine who had a history of well-controlled hypertension, eight of whom on medical management (two on lisinopril, one on verapamil, one on atenolol, one on hydrochlorothiazide, one on combination hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene, one on combination hydrochlorothiazide and benazepril, and one on an unknown medication).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this observational study of a never-smoking cohort with a history of remote but prolonged exposure to SHS, we found the cohort to have an abnormal cardiovascular response to exercise that was proportional to their SHS exposure. Volume of oxygen uptake at peak exercise (VO<sub>2Peak</sub>) was associated with years of exposure to SHS, and over 80% of that association was dependent on O<sub>2</sub>-Pulse<sub>Peak</sub>, suggesting that the effect of SHS exposure on exercise capacity to be mainly mediated through SHS effect on stroke volume and cardiac output. We also found suggestive evidence, although not statistically significant (P&#x003D;0.066), that pulmonary air trapping (elevated FRC/TLC and RV/TLC) contribute to lower exercise capacity through its effect on O<sub>2</sub>- Pulse<sub>Peak</sub>, implicating an interacting lung and heart pathophysiology between pulmonary hyperinflation and cardiac output that further impairs exercise capacity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Furthermore, we found over 60% of the participants to have a hypertensive response to exercise, suggesting that abnormal escalation of afterload contributed to lower exercise capacity in this SHS-exposed cohort in whom, with the exception of a few (5.4%) with well-controlled hypertension, none had any known cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Overall, we found evidence that prolonged exposure to SHS, even when remote, is associated with cardiovascular abnormalities suggestive of occult cardiovascular dysfunction with potential additional contribution from pulmonary hyperinflation. These abnormalities reveal subtle but lower cardiopulmonary functional reserve, manifested here as lower exercise capacity, and implicate a reduced efficiency of body&#x2019;s oxygen delivery machinery, which could be disadvantageous during the times of increased cardiopulmonary output demands as in physiological distress or disease.</p>
<p>In previous studies, we have shown this cohort of never-smokers with history of prolonged remote SHS exposure to have abnormal lung function at rest and abnormal pulmonary response to exercise including (1) reduced diffusing capacity at rest,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> (2) reduced pulmonary capillary recruitment (as measured by impaired rise in diffusing capacity) during exercise,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> (3) decreased small airways airflow indices on spirometry (maximal flow in mid- and end-expiratory airflows [FEF<sub>25-75%</sub> and FEF<sub>75%</sub>]),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> (4) plethysmographic and radiographic evidence of pulmonary air trapping at rest,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and (5) progressive (dynamic) pulmonary hyperinflation during exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Overall, these abnormalities are suggestive of presence of an unrecognized early or mild obstructive lung disease that, while not meeting the spirometric definition of COPD, is consistent with an early/mild disease that could be categorized as &#x201C;pre-COPD&#x201D; and could contribute to lower pulmonary reserve and potential adverse health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current study, we sought to determine whether there are also subtle cardiovascular abnormalities in this SHS-exposed cohort that are indicative of an occult and/or subclinical cardiovascular disease. Our finding that past exposure to SHS is a predictor of exercise capacity in an O<sub>2</sub>-pulse-dependent (a proxy of stroke volume and cardiac output) manner is novel and suggests that SHS exposure has lasting effect on cardiac function that is observable years after the exposure has ceased, and is consistent with recent findings that long-standing <italic>direct</italic> tobacco smoking impairs cardiac systolic function as evident by an increase in left and right ventricle end-systolic volumes and reduced left and right ejection fractions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> Although it remains unclear how exposure to tobacco smoke, <italic>direct</italic> or <italic>indirect</italic>, causes an impairment in cardiac function, an interaction between pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, which occupy the same body cavity (thorax), has been proposed to play a role. Air trapping as measured by lung volumes (FRC/TLC and RV/TLC) is the earliest manifestation of COPD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and is associated with reduced exercise capacity due to ventilatory limitation caused by progressive air trapping and pulmonary hyperinflation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Changes in lung volumes due to pulmonary hyperinflation could cause increased intra-thoracic pressures, particularly during exertion, and thus adversely affect the cardiovascular function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> To investigate this possible mechanism, we examined whether air trapping did contribute to exercise capacity through an interaction with cardiac output by performing a mediation analysis among pulmonary air trapping (FRC/TLC and RV/TLC), cardiac stroke volume (O<sub>2</sub>-pulse), and exercise capacity (VO<sub>2Peak</sub>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Although the analysis did not reach statistical significance (P&#x003D;0.066 and P&#x003D;0.122 for FRC/TLC and RV/TLC, respectively) and thus could not provide any further corroborating evidence for our hypothesis, the analysis did suggest that a large proportion (60%) of air trapping effect on VO<sub>2Peak</sub> may be mediated through stroke volume. Further research in this area would be needed to better understand the interaction of cardiovascular and pulmonary systems in the context of exposure to direct or indirect smoke.</p>
<p>Another remarkable observation in our study was the common presence of hypertensive response to exercise (HRE). Despite some data to the contrary,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> studies have described HRE in individuals with or without presence of baseline hypertension to be associated with impaired systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction even in the setting of having negative stress test and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> In fact, increasing evidence indicates that HRE is associated with functional and structural heart abnormalities, future development of hypertension, and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> In our study, we found a substantial number of participants (62%) to have HRE despite all either having no history of hypertension (95%) or having hypertension that was well-controlled (5%). Studies have reported the prevalence of HRE to be between 3% to 40% among apparently healthy cohorts of varying age, sex, and ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> Although we did not observe a significant association between presence of HRE and history of SHS exposure, the high prevalence of HRE among this never-smoking but SHS-exposed healthy cohort is remarkable, and suggests a potential pathogenetic role for SHS exposure in development of HRE.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our study has limitations that should be kept in view. First, there may be concerns about the generalizability of the findings because the cohort studied are mostly women, which reflects the demographics of those who worked in airlines as flight crew in the latter half of the last century when smoking in aircraft cabin was permitted. The choice to study the flight crew allowed for overcoming the challenge of long-term SHS exposure assessment by providing the ability to generate a more objective and reproducible exposure index based on employment history and the smoking ban timeline on domestic and international flights of different airlines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Women have been reported to be more susceptible to adverse health effects of tobacco smoke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> However, at the minimum, the findings should be generalizable to women. Second, the cardiovascular findings reported in this study are mainly derived from CPET with no imaging (such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) or other clinical studies to provide additional robust evidence to corroborate our findings. Such studies are needed and are in progress (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: NCT04715568). Nevertheless, studies describing cardiovascular health effects of <italic>direct</italic> smoking using echocardiography and MRI have been previously reported, which corroborate our findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> Our report however is the first report that describes the chronic and long-term cardiovascular health effects due to past prolonged exposure to SHS. Third, while we found association of exercise capacity (VO<sub>2Peak</sub>) with years of SHS exposure, the association of respiratory symptoms with SHS was less striking and less consistent across the different questionnaire platforms. However, it is not uncommon to see differences in scores across different respiratory questionnaires,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> and similarly, baseline respiratory symptoms (mMRC and FAMRI questionnaires) may measure different things and thus produce different scores compared to those done at peak exercise (Borg Scale). For example, subjects who had impairments at baseline and thus were more symptomatic are likely to not perform as well during the exercise and thus may report lesser symptoms in a sub-maximal effort exercise test.</p>

<sec id="s5">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Healthy never-smokers with history of remote but prolonged exposure to SHS have an abnormal cardiovascular response to exercise, which is characterized by a stroke volume (oxygen-pulse) and thus an exercise capacity that are reduced proportional to their years of exposure to SHS. The mechanisms by which past exposure to SHS may limit stroke volume and thus exercise capacity is unknown, but pulmonary hyperinflation may have a contributory effect beyond its role in ventilatory limitation. Furthermore, these SHS-exposed individuals have a considerably higher prevalence of hypertensive response to exercise than that reported in healthy general population. Overall, the abnormal cardiovascular response to exercise in this population reveals the presence of an occult or subclinical pathology that impairs the cardiopulmonary functional reserve and reduces the efficiency of body&#x2019;s oxygen delivery machinery, which could be disadvantageous during the times of increased cardiopulmonary output demands as in physiological distress or disease.</p>
