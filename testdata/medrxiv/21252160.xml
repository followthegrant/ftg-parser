<title>ABSTRACT</title><p>Neutrophil-mediated activation and injury of the endothelium play a role in the pathogenesis of diverse disease states ranging from autoimmunity to cancer to COVID-19. Neutralization of cationic proteins (such as neutrophil extracellular trap/NET-derived histones) with polyanionic compounds has been suggested as a potential strategy for protecting the endothelium from such insults. Here, we report that the FDA-approved polyanionic agent defibrotide (a pleotropic mixture of oligonucleotides) directly engages histones and thereby blocks their pathological effects on endothelium. <italic>In vitro</italic>, defibrotide counteracted endothelial cell activation and cell death, whether triggered by purified NETs, COVID-19 serum containing high levels of NETs, or recombinant histone H4. <italic>In vivo</italic>, defibrotide stabilized the endothelium and protected against histone-accelerated inferior vena cava thrombosis in mice. Mechanistically, defibrotide demonstrated direct and tight binding to histone H4 as detected by both electrophoretic mobility shift assay and surface plasmon resonance. Taken together, these data provide insights into the potential role of polyanionic compounds in protecting the endothelium from thromboinflammation with potential implications for myriad NET- and histone-accelerated disease states.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Neutrophils are the most abundant innate effector cells of the human immune system, exerting antimicrobial effects through phagocytosis and degranulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (<bold>NETs</bold>)&#x2014;web-like structures composed of microbicidal cytosolic and granule proteins enmeshed in decondensed chromatin&#x2014;is a recently described strategy by which neutrophils kill microbes in tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. However, when formed intravascularly, NETs are potentially noxious, trapping red blood cells, activating platelets, and damaging the endothelium&#x2014;thereby promoting coagulation, vascular occlusion, and thrombosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Endothelial activation and injury driven by NETs has been revealed as a key pathogenic step in a variety of disease states including deep vein thrombosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, transfusion-related acute lung injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and lupus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Very recently, high levels of NETs were detected in the blood of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, where they likely activate contribute to the endothelial damage regularly noted on the histopathology of COVID- 19 organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>NETs present a variety of highly cationic proteins, including histones, HMGB1, calprotectin, cathepsin G, and LL-37, among others. While these proteins contribute to the capture and inactivation of invading microorganisms, they may also be cytotoxic to host tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. To this end, NET-derived histones account for &#x223C;70&#x0025; of NET-associated proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and have been associated with endothelial damage and multiple organ dysfunction in acute states such as sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, acute pancreatitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, acute respiratory distress syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and severe trauma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. High levels of circulating histones (up to 250 &#x03BC;g/ml after trauma)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> activate and damage endothelial cells via pore formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, engagement of innate sensors such as Toll-like receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and the NLRP3 inflammasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, and forced release of von Willebrand factor (vWF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. On balance, the result is a hypercoagulable state and an increased risk of vascular events including thrombosis. Targeting histones by neutralizing their cationic nature with polyanions has been suggested as an approach to combatting various NET- and histone-associated diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Defibrotide is a pleotropic mixture of oligonucleotides (90&#x0025; single-stranded phosphodiester oligonucleotides and 10&#x0025; double-stranded) that is derived from porcine intestinal mucosal DNA and which has antithrombotic, fibrinolytic, and anti- inflammatory activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Defibrotide was initially approved for the treatment of thrombophlebitis and as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis in Italy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> (although these approvals are no longer active). Subsequently, it was granted an orphan drug designation by European and American regulatory agencies for the treatment of serious hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (Europe) or VOD with renal and/or pulmonary dysfunction post- transplant (United States)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Although defibrotide&#x2019;s mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood, there is evidence that it protects endothelium, modulates platelet activation, potentiates fibrinolysis, decreases thrombin generation and activity, and reduces circulating levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Defibrotide has also been demonstrated to associate with cationic proteins, for example collagen I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we hypothesized that the polyanionic properties of defibrotide might mitigate damage to the endothelium by NETs and especially NET-derived cationic proteins. In pursuit of this possibility, we characterized defibrotide&#x2019;s endothelium-protective properties both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a mouse model of venous thrombosis.</p>

<title>Defibrotide inhibits the activation of cultured endothelial cells by NETs</title>
<p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured with human neutrophil- derived NETs in the presence or absence of defibrotide. To gauge the adhesive potential of the cultured HUVECs, gene transcripts associated with the expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were quantified. In all cases, expression was markedly increased by NETs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1A-C</bold></xref>), with expression subsequently mitigated by defibrotide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1A-C</bold></xref>). We reasoned that if these gene expression differences were functionally meaningful, then adhesion of neutrophils to the HUVEC monolayer should track in similar fashion (increased by NETs and decreased by defibrotide). As predicted, calcein-AM-labeled human neutrophils adhered more strongly to NET- activated HUVECs, an effect that was reduced in the presence of defibrotide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>). Beyond surface adhesion molecules, previous work has also suggested that NETs upregulate expression of tissue factor (TF) by endothelial cells, thereby contributing to the prothrombotic state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Here we found that TF was upregulated by NETs whether measured by gene expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1E</bold></xref>) or enzymatic activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1F</bold></xref>); in both contexts, NET-mediated increases were significantly reduced by defibrotide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1E-F</bold></xref>). Taken together, these data support the basic premise of the study, namely that defibrotide can neutralize the activation of endothelial cells by NETs.</p>

<title>Defibrotide reduces HUVEC activation by COVID-19 serum</title>
<p>The work of our group and many others has demonstrated high levels of NETs in the circulation of patients with COVID-19, where NETs appear to track closely with disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. We therefore reasoned that defibrotide might be able to reduce activation of endothelial cells by COVID-19 serum. To address this, we developed an in-cell ELISA platform compatible with our Biosafety Level-3 facility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). We first confirmed that purified NETs would increase surface expression of E-selectin, ICAM- 1, and VCAM-1 in this assay, and that these increases could be mitigated by defibrotide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2B-D</bold></xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found a similar upregulation of surface E-selectin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref>), ICAM-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2F</bold></xref>) and VCAM-1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2G</bold></xref>) when HUVECs were cultured with pooled COVID-19 serum, with that upregulation partially counteracted by defibrotide. In summary, these data support the idea that defibrotide can reduce activation of endothelial cells by NETs, and hint at potential clinical utility in diseases such as COVID-19.</p>

<title>Transcriptome profiling confirms a NET-induced proinflammatory signature in endothelial cells, which can be mitigated by defibrotide</title>
<p>The above data demonstrate activation of endothelial cells by NETs in the context of selected genes associated with cell-cell interactions and coagulation. To more broadly understand the pathways associated with endothelial cell activation, we performed RNA sequencing of HUVECs exposed to vehicle, NETs, or NETs &#x002B; defibrotide. We identified 440 differentially expressed genes (300 upregulated) in HUVECs upon NET stimulation as compared with vehicle. Conversely, there were 229 differentially expressed genes (192 downregulated) when the NETs &#x002B; defibrotide group was compared to NETs alone. The top regulated genes are displayed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>. Functional gene network analysis of upregulated genes in NET-stimulated HUVECs revealed an inflammatory signature highlighted by meta groups such as the TNF signaling pathway, NF-&#x0138;B signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). Notably, the same pathways that were upregulated by NETs were likely to be downregulated by defibrotide (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>). Genes downregulated by NETs were also assessed by functional gene network analysis. Important pathways related to cell growth and anti-inflammation were downregulated by NETs, including the Hippo signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, and TGF-&#x03B2; signaling pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>). These same pathways were then upregulated when defibrotide was added to NETs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref>). Taken together, these data confirm the ability of NETs to activate endothelial cells, and demonstrate the ability of defibrotide to reverse those effects.</p>

<title>Blocking histone H4 counteracts HUVEC activation by NETs</title>
<p>As discussed above, part of the original hypothesis was that the polyanionic nature of defibrotide might make it especially effective at neutralizing NET-derived cationic proteins such as histones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, which are important mediators of inflammation, tissue injury, and organ dysfunction in the extracellular space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. To begin to address this, we asked whether a histone-neutralizing antibody might be effective in our system. Indeed, an anti-histone H4 antibody counteracted the upregulation of HUVEC E-selectin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>), ICAM-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>), VCAM-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>), and TF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>) by NETs.</p>

As expected, purified histone H4 increased expression of E-selectin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>), ICAM- 1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>), and VCAM-1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>) by HUVECs, while defibrotide almost completely abolished these effects. Mechanistically, both TLR2 and TLR4 were involved in histone H4-mediated endothelial cell activation (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2</bold>) as has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and MCP-1) in HUVEC supernatants also increased upon exposure to histone H4 and were subsequently suppressed by defibrotide (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1</bold>). Similar patterns were also observed for TF gene expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>) and enzymatic activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5E</bold></xref>). Given these findings, along with the RNA sequencing data, we investigated whether defibrotide might be working to counterbalance intracellular signaling pathways associated with TLRs or TNF signaling. However, in our hands, defibrotide&#x2019;s protective properties did not extend to HUVEC activation by either LPS or TNF-&#x03B1; (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3</bold>). We next tested whether defibrotide might work through direct engagement with histone H4 in the extracellular space. Indeed, using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, we found evidence of a direct interaction between histone H4 and defibrotide in that histone H4 could retard the migration of defibrotide (a mixture of oligonucleotides) through an agarose gel (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5F</bold></xref>). In contrast, histone H4 had no impact on the migration of bovine serum albumin. A strong interaction between histone H4 and defibrotide was also confirmed by surface plasmon resonance. Assuming an average molecular weight of defibrotide as 16.5 kilodaltons, the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) between defibrotide and histone H4 was calculated as 53.5 nM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5G</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Defibrotide strongly protects endothelial cells against histone H4-induced cell death</title>
<p>The above assays were focused on relatively short cell culture times, typically 6 hours. However, we questioned whether the impact of defibrotide on histone H4- mediated HUVEC activation would persist over longer periods of time. As reported previously, histones go beyond endothelial cell activation and become cytotoxic upon prolonged exposure in culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Indeed, we found remarkable protection of cell viability by defibrotide over a 24-hour period (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>). To further confirm these findings, we varied the experiment by introducing kinetic monitoring of surface phosphatidylserine exposure as measured by Annexin V binding. We found a dose- dependent relationship between histone H4 and Annexin V binding (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4</bold>), and found strong and stepwise protection when HUVECs were also cultured with defibrotide concentrations ranging from 10-40 &#x03BC;g/ml (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>). We also found increased levels of both IL-1&#x03B2; and IL-18 in culture supernatants, both of which were reduced by defibrotide (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6C-D</bold></xref>), supporting the idea that histone H4-mediated cell death may be on the spectrum of pyroptosis. To further substantiate these data, we also assessed translocation and subsequent release of the alarmin HMGB1, which is known to track with inflammatory forms of cell death including pyroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. By microscopy, we observed the translocation of HMGB1 from nucleus to cytoplasm upon exposure of HUVECs to histone H4, with reversal of this effect by defibrotide (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6E</bold></xref>). Measurement of HMGB1 in culture supernatants mirrored these findings, with histone H4 triggering HMGB1 release and defibrotide neutralizing that effect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6F</bold></xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that longer-term exposure of HUVECs to histone H4 triggers cell death (which may be of a proinflammatory nature) and that defibrotide&#x2019;s anti-histone effects are sustained in culture for up to 24 hours.</p>

<title>Defibrotide counters histone-accelerated venous thrombosis in mice</title>
<p>To determine the potential <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of these findings, we employed a model of venous thrombosis in which a constricting ligature is fixed around the inferior vena cava (IVC) and then the presence and potential characteristics of thrombosis are assessed 24 hours later (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>As evidence continues to implicate NETs and NET-derived histones in the pathophysiology of disease states ranging from infection (including COVID-19) to autoimmunity to cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, the search for NET-targeting therapeutics takes on additional importance. Here, we explored the extent to which an FDA-approved drug defibrotide might protect endothelial cells from NETs and extracellular histones. We found defibrotide to counteract endothelial cell activation and hypercoagulability triggered by NETs, COVID-19 serum with high NETs, and histone H4. Mechanistically, our evidence points to a direct interaction between defibrotide and cationic proteins such as histone H4 as an important aspect of these protective effects.</p>
<p>Polyanionic substances naturally exist in the extracellular environment where they play a variety of biological roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Unfractionated heparin and suramin are examples of how polyanionic drugs may be leveraged clinically with the potential to bind cationic microbe-derived proteins as well as cationic tumor cytokines/receptors for treatment of infectious diseases and cancer, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. In previous work, defibrotide&#x2019;s polyanionic properties have been shown to include binding with high affinity to specific heparin-binding proteins including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Interestingly, defibrotide (oligonucleotides) and heparins (proteoglycans) share similarities in charge distributions and binding patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Histones bind DNA tightly mainly due to charge-charge interactions, with a possible role for specific DNA sequence motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Our results found a strong interaction between histone H4 and defibrotide, which was very resistant to dissociation. Considering defibrotide is a natural product (i.e., not produced by a DNA synthesizer), the possibility of any specific sequence dominating its effect is low. We therefore speculate that the main binding force between histone H4 and defibrotide also comes from charge-charge interactions. An interesting unknown is the extent to which the degradation of defibrotide <italic>in vivo</italic> may be delayed upon binding histone H4. Typically, phosphodiester oligonucleotides would be rapidly degraded in plasma; however, we found a protective role in an animal model over 24 hours without the need for redosing. A deeper understanding of these <italic>in vivo</italic> properties should be a priority for future research.</p>
<p>As a major component of NETs, histones are responsible for microvascular dysfunction during sepsis where they trigger neutrophil migration, endothelial injury, hemorrhage, and thrombosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Compared with other histones, histone H4 has the strongest impact on platelets, enhancing thrombin generation and accelerating thrombosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Histone H4 has also been reported as the major histone mediator of membrane lysis of smooth muscle cells and arterial tissue damage and inflammation in atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Our study has now also revealed that neutralizing histone H4 significantly mitigates NET-mediated activation of HUVECs. Whether defibrotide preferentially neutralizes histone H4 as compared with other histones is an area deserving of further research.</p>
<p>Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is widely considered to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for patients admitted to an intensive care unit, where it encompasses heterogeneous disease states such as sepsis, shock, trauma, severe burn, and pancreatitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Systemic inflammation and vascular coagulopathy account for the main pathological processes of MODS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, and of course also characterize aspects of COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> and the closely related catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. In MODS, endothelial cell activation is considered a precursor to tissue damage and end-organ dysfunction with upregulation of adhesion molecules triggered by cytokines, microbial proteins, and various cationic proteins from necrotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. One recent study evaluated circulating histones in a cohort of 420 ICU patients with sepsis, severe trauma, or severe pancreatitis and identified circulating histones as major mediators of MODS in these patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. One may consider whether administration of defibrotide in an early phase of MODS might neutralize cationic proteins such as histones to stabilize the endothelium and break the vicious thromboinflammatory cycle. We are hopeful that further preclinical (and soon clinical) work may have the opportunity to explore the potential of defibrotide as a NET- and histone-neutralizing drug.</p>

To model large-vein thrombosis was modeled as we have described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Mice were injected with either histone (10 mg/kg) or saline 1 hour prior to surgery via tail vein. Defibrotide (150 mg/kg) or an equal volume of saline were administered intravenously via retro-orbital injection. The first dosage of defibrotide was given 24 hours prior to surgery, and the second dose was delivered just after closure of the abdomen. Thrombus was determined 24 hours later.</p>

<title>Quantification of mouse soluble E-selectin and P-selectin</title>
<p>Soluble E-selectin and P-selectin were quantified in mice sera using the mouse E-selectin Duoset ELISA (DY575, R&#x0026;D system) and mouse P-selectin Duoset ELISA (DY737, R&#x0026;D system) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism software version 8. For continuous variables, group means were compared by either t-test (two groups) or one-way ANOVA (more than two groups); correction for multiple comparisons was by Dunnett&#x2019;s, Sidak&#x2019;s, or Tukey&#x2019;s method. For two independent variables, group means were compared by two-way ANOVA (more than two groups); correction for multiple comparisons was by Dunnett&#x2019;s method. Correlations were tested by Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficient. Statistical significance was defined as p&#x003C;0.05.</p>
