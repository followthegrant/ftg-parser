<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>In the Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) trial, estimated mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy against coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was 94&#x0025;. SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurements were assessed as correlates of COVID-19 risk and as correlates of protection.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Through case-cohort sampling, participants were selected for measurement of four serum antibody markers at Day 1 (first dose), Day 29 (second dose), and Day 57: IgG binding antibodies (bAbs) to Spike, bAbs to Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), and 50&#x0025; and 80&#x0025; inhibitory dilution pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers calibrated to the WHO International Standard (cID50 and cID80). Participants with no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Cox regression assessed in vaccine recipients the association of each Day 29 or 57 serologic marker with COVID-19 through 126 or 100 days of follow-up, respectively, adjusting for risk factors.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Day 57 Spike IgG, RBD IgG, cID50, and cID80 neutralization levels were each inversely correlated with risk of COVID-19: hazard ratios 0.66 (95&#x0025; CI 0.50, 0.88; p=0.005); 0.57 (0.40, 0.82; p=0.002); 0.42 (0.27, 0.65; p&#x003C;0.001); 0.35 (0.20, 0.61; p&#x003C;0.001) per 10-fold increase in marker level, respectively, multiplicity adjusted P-values 0.003-0.010. Results were similar for Day 29 markers (multiplicity adjusted P-values &#x003C;0.001-0.003). For vaccine recipients with Day 57 reciprocal cID50 neutralization titers that were undetectable (&#x003C;2.42), 100, or 1000, respectively, cumulative incidence of COVID-19 through 100 days post Day 57 was 0.030 (0.010, 0.093), 0.0056 (0.0039, 0.0080), and 0.0023 (0.0013, 0.0036). For vaccine recipients at these titer levels, respectively, vaccine efficacy was 50.8&#x0025; (&#x2212;51.2, 83.0&#x0025;), 90.7&#x0025; (86.7, 93.6&#x0025;), and 96.1&#x0025; (94.0, 97.8&#x0025;). Causal mediation analysis estimated that the proportion of vaccine efficacy mediated through Day 29 cID50 titer was 68.5&#x0025; (58.5, 78.4&#x0025;).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Binding and neutralizing antibodies correlated with COVID-19 risk and vaccine efficacy and likely have utility in predicting mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy against COVID-19.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>

<title>Laboratory methods</title>
<p>A solid-phase electrochemiluminescence S-binding IgG immunoassay was developed for simultaneous quantitative detection of IgG antibodies to three distinct SARS-CoV-2 antigens in human serum. This validated assay uses custom plates manufactured by Meso Scale Discovery (Rockville, Maryland) provided as 4-plex, detecting SARS-CoV-2 prefusion stabilized Spike protein (S-2P), RBD, and Nucleocapsid, with a bovine serum albumin control ligand. The Spike and RBD markers were converted to International Units for assessment as immune correlates. Neutralizing antibodies were measured in a formally validated assay as a function of reductions in luciferase reporter gene expression after a single round of infection with SARS-CoV-2.D614G Spike-pseudotyped virus in 293T/ACE2 cells as described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> ID50 and ID80 nAb titers were calculated based on a dose-response curve and were calibrated to the WHO anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin International Standard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and the resulting calibrated ID50 titer (cID50) and calibrated ID80 titer (cID80) assessed as immune correlates.

<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>All data analyses were pre-specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (Supplementary Material), summarized here. A case-cohort sampling design was used for selecting participants for measurement of antibody markers at Day 1, 29, 57,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> comprising a random sample of all participants, stratified by cross-classified randomization arm, baseline SARS-CoV-2 positivity, protocol randomization strata (Age below 65 years At-Risk, Age below 65 years Not At-Risk, Age above 65 years), and underrepresented minority status, and all other participants who acquired an intercurrent or post Day 57 COVID-19 endpoint until database lock. At-Risk comprised six self-reported health/comorbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Analyses were based on the case-cohort set defined by the subset of selected participants with no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and per-protocol received both doses without major protocol violations (Figure S2). Each participant had two inverse probability sampling (IPS) weights calculated, for Day 29 and Day 57 marker correlates analyses. Day 29 and Day 57 marker correlates analyses excluded participants with any evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before 7 days post Day 29 and Day 57 visit, respectively, because natural infection before the serology may have modulated the antibody response.</p>
<p>For each marker, values below the assay limit of detection (LOD) were set to LOD/2, and values above the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) were set to ULOQ. Positive responses for Spike IgG and RBD IgG were defined by IgG &#x003E; 10.8424 IU/ml and 14.0858 IU/ml, respectively. Positive responses for cID50 and cID80 were defined by value &#x003E; LOD (LOD = 2.42 and 15.02, respectively). All analyses were done reproducibly based on R scripts hosted at the Github code repository CoVPN/correlates_reporting, which are publicly available with application to a mock COVE trial data set.</p>
<p>The positive response rate for each marker and analyzed group was estimated by an IPS-weighted average, with 95&#x0025; confidence interval (CI) calculated with an IPS-weighted Clopper-Pearson method. Differences in response rates with 95&#x0025; CIs were calculated by the Wilson-Score method without continuity correction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> Geometric mean concentration (GMC) or titer (GMT) and their ratios between cases vs. non-cases were estimated with 95&#x0025; CIs, with hypothesis tests, based on the t-distribution with IPS weighting.

<title>Antibody marker distributions</title>
<p>At Day 57, almost 100&#x0025; of vaccine recipients had positive/detectable antibody response by all four markers (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This was also true at Day 29 for Spike IgG and RBD IgG, whereas cID50 and cID80 titers were detectable in 82&#x0025; and 64&#x0025; of vaccine recipients, respectively. Each marker was moderately correlated between the Day 29 and Day 57 time points (Spearman rank r = 0.527 to 0.625, Figure S5). Median (interquartile range) days from dose one to Day 29 was 28 (28 to 30) and from Day 29 to Day 57 was 28 (28 to 30). The Spike IgG and RBD IgG markers were tightly correlated (Spearman rank r = 0.942, 0.969 at Day 29, 57; Figures S6, S7), as were the cID50 and cID80 markers (r = 0.968, 0.961 at Day 29, 57; Figures S6, S7). Accordingly, some results only show Spike IgG and cID50 for brevity; results were similar for RBD IgG and cID80 (Supplementary Appendix).

<p>Vaccine efficacy estimates (obtained using the method of Gilbert, Fong, and Carone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>) increased with Day 57 cID50 neutralization titer: At undetectable (&#x003C;LOD) Day 57 cID50 titer, vaccine efficacy was 50.8&#x0025; (&#x2212;51.2, 83.0&#x0025;).

Figures S21-S27 show these results for the other seven antibody markers.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>For recipients of two doses of mRNA-1273 in the COVE trial, all four antibody markers at Day 29 and at Day 57 were inverse correlates of risk of COVID-19 occurrence through 3-4 months post second dose. Based on any of the antibody markers, COVID-19 risk was about 10 times lower for vaccine recipients with antibodies in the top 10&#x0025; of values compared to those with negative/undetectable values (the same value as in baseline negative placebo recipients).</p>
<p>The correlates of protection analyses found that estimated vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 increased with Day 29 and with Day 57 antibody levels, where for the latter estimated vaccine efficacy was about 45-60&#x0025; for vaccine recipients with negative/undetectable binding or neutralizing antibody response (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; Figures S21C, S22C, S23C) and increased to above 98&#x0025; at highest antibody levels. Positive vaccine efficacy for the vaccinated subgroup with negative/undetectable antibody level implies lack of full mediation of vaccine efficacy through the antibody marker,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and formal causal analysis estimated that 68&#x0025; of the overall vaccine efficacy was mediated through Day 29 cID50 titer. To interpret the mediation result: if neutralizing antibodies circulating on Day 29 could be removed but the other consequences of vaccination remained, overall vaccine efficacy would be expected to change from 92.3&#x0025; to 56&#x0025;, a 68&#x0025; reduction (on the log scale) of overall vaccine efficacy. In comparison, hemagglutination inhibition titer against B/Victoria influenza virus mediated an estimated 57&#x0025; of inactivated influenza vaccine efficacy against virologically confirmed B/Victoria influenza illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> As hemagglutination inhibition titer has been used to guide vaccine strain selection and approval, this defines a benchmark for a potential level of mediation relevant for supporting vaccine approval decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> The very high overall vaccine efficacy and the small number of vaccine recipients with negative/undetectable antibody levels in COVE limited the ability to identify a high percentage of neutralization-mediated vaccine efficacy. Similar analyses of trials with lower vaccine efficacy and lower neutralization response rates may be able to detect a greater percentage of vaccine efficacy mediated through neutralizing antibody titers.</p>
<p>An interpretation also consistent with our results is that neutralization as a biological function did fully mediate the vaccine efficacy in COVE, but the cID50 and cID80 markers had inadequate sensitivity to quantify low-level neutralization below the detection limit that was partially protective. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that passive transfer of purified IgG from mRNA-1273-immunized rhesus macaques was sufficient to protect golden Syrian hamsters from disease after SARS-CoV-2 challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> Yet, it is more likely that additional immune responses are needed to fully explain the observed vaccine efficacy, given that the vaccine provided more than 90&#x0025; efficacy by Day 29,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> 18&#x0025; of vaccine recipients had undetectable neutralization response at Day 29 based on cID50 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Figure S8), and the vaccine elicited other immune responses by Day 29 in a high proportion of vaccine recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> In addition to markers measuring distinct immunological functions, markers not measured fully in serum (e.g., mucosal markers) and/or anamnestic responses not fully represented by a single time point measurement may be needed to fully explain vaccine efficacy.</p>
<p>The immune correlates results of the AZD12222 trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> for Spike IgG and RBD IgG can be quantitatively compared to the COVE results by virtue of the same MSD assay platform, conversion of IgG concentration to WHO International Units/ml, and the same antibody measurement time: 4 weeks post second dose. Estimated ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine efficacy was 70&#x0025; and 90&#x0025; at Spike IgG levels of 113 (95&#x0025; CI &#x003C; LOD = 0.31, 245) and 899 (369, NC) IU/ml, respectively, and at RBD IgG levels of 165 (&#x003C; LOD = 1.59, 452) and 2360 (723, NC) IU/ml, respectively (NC = not calculated).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> In comparison, estimated mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy was 70&#x0025; and 90&#x0025; at Day 57 Spike IgG levels of 1 (&#x003C; LOD = 0.31, 170) and 298 (1, 1786) IU/ml, respectively, and at Day 57 RBD IgG levels of 8 (&#x003C; LOD = 1.59, 243) and 775 (29, 2819) IU/ml, respectively. These results are suggestive that lower binding antibody levels in COVE are associated with the same level of vaccine efficacy.</p>
<p>Pseudovirus neutralization results can also be compared between the trials using calibrated ID50 titers, where estimated ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine efficacy was 70&#x0025; and 90&#x0025; at cID50 titer of 8 (&#x003C; LOD = 2.42, 26) and 140 (43, NC), compared to COVE results at cID50 titer of 4 (&#x003C; LOD = 2.42, 22) and 83 (16, 188). The neutralization assays employed for AZD12222 and COVE used the D614 and D614G pseudovirus, respectively, such that this comparison is affected by any difference in neutralization sensitivity of these two strains. As a sensitivity analysis, we multiplied the AZD12222 cID50 values by a second conversion factor, 2.19, which scales the values as if D614G had been used in the assay (2.19 was calculated from the validation study that used both strains, Supplementary Text 1). The cID50 titers at 70&#x0025; and 90&#x0025; ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine efficacy are 18 (&#x003C; LOD = 2.42, 57) and 307 (95, NC), respectively.</p>
<p>With the caveats of different study endpoints/hosts, the COVE results are also consistent with results on Spike IgG and neutralizing antibody titers as correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 replication in mRNA-1273-vaccinated rhesus macaques. For instance, all macaques with Spike IgG &#x003E; 336 IU/ml at 4 weeks post second dose were protected from &#x003E;10,000 subgenomic RNA copies/ml in bronchoalveolar lavages,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and in COVE, Day 57 Spike IgG of 336 IU/ml corresponded to 90&#x0025; vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 (Figure S22).</p>
<p>Together with evidence from other studies, the current results support that neutralization titer is a potential surrogate marker for mRNA-1273 vaccination against COVID-19 that can be considered as a primary endpoint for basing certain accelerated approval decisions. The total body of evidence may support an immunogenicity non-inferiority approach to bridging vaccine efficacy of refined or novel mRNA vaccines, which has been proposed for adding vaccine spike variants and boosters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> One open question challenging this approach is whether titers to different strains have different relationships with vaccine efficacy. A more challenging objective is bridging vaccine efficacy of new candidate vaccines in different platforms from mRNA. When correlates results are available from several phase 3 vaccine efficacy trials of different vaccine platforms, it will be possible to conduct validation analyses of how well an antibody marker can be used to predict vaccine efficacy across platforms.</p>
<p>We also note that the Day 29 markers correlated with COVID-19 at least as strongly as the Day 57 markers. If a Day 29 immune marker in recipients of two mRNA-1273 doses becomes established as a correlate of protection, it could be a more practical surrogate marker than a Day 57 marker by virtue of being measured earlier and because trials would not need participants to come back for a Day 57 study visit.</p>
<p>Limitations of this correlates study include the lack of data for assessing correlates against other outcomes besides COVID-19 (e.g., severe COVID-19, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, infection regardless of symptomology, viral shedding), the lack of assessment of correlates for recipients of only one mRNA-1273 dose, and the fact that almost all COVID-19 cases resulted from infections with viruses bearing genetically and antigenically similar Spike as compared to the ancestral Spike in the vaccine, implying that it was not possible to assess robustness of correlates to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. However, the paucity of divergent circulating virus is also a strength in affording a clear interpretation as correlates against COVID-19 caused by variants genetically close to the vaccine. Another strength is the use of validated assays with all results reported in WHO International Units or calibrated to WHO International Standards, facilitating comparison of results from other studies and vaccine platforms. An additional strength is the racial and ethnic diversity of the trial participants and large number of diverse participants sampled for immunogenicity measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study evaluated antibody markers measured at two specific time points (Day 29, Day 57) as immune correlates against subsequent COVID-19 occurrence over 3-4 months follow-up, but did not assess how the current level of antibody correlated with instantaneous risk of COVID-19. COVE follows participants for 2 years, enabling future analyses of when and how vaccine efficacy wanes as antibody levels wane and as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge, informing decisions about the timing of a booster or the need to update vaccine composition, and potentially clarifying the mediation of protection. Future correlates analyses that study antibody markers over time in relation to the timing of breakthrough infections of variants with variable neutralization sensitivity might further clarify functional mediation of protection.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the result that all evaluated binding and neutralizing antibody markers strongly inversely correlated with COVID-19 risk, and directly correlated with vaccine efficacy, as well as the result that a substantial proportion of the overall vaccine efficacy was mediated through neutralizing antibody levels, adds evidence toward establishing an immune marker surrogate endpoint for COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
