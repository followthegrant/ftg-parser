<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Objectives</title>
<p>Our study identified barriers and facilitators in implementing HIV Self-Testing (HIVST), including the perceptions of men-having-sex-with-men (MSM) and transgender women on HIVST. Furthermore, we explored the current knowledge, practices, and potential of HIVST among the MSM and TGW populations.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Design</title>
<p>Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) were administered using semi-structured interviews administered in both English and Filipin. Thematic analysis of the findings was done after transcribing all audio recordings.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The study was done in the National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines using online video conferencing platforms due to mobility restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All study participants were either MSM or TGW, 18 to 49 years old, and residing/working in NCR. Exclusion criteria include biologically born female and/or currently on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications, or an HIV-positive diagnosis.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty informants were interviewed, of which 75&#x0025; were MSM, and most of them preferred the use of HIVST. Facilitators and barriers to the use of HIVST were grouped into three main themes: Acceptability, distribution, and monitoring and tracking. Convenience and confidentiality, overcoming fears, and normalization of HIV testing services (HTS) in the country were why the participants preferred HIVST. Social media was recognized as a powerful tool in promoting HIVST. The use of a welcoming tone and positive language should be taken into consideration due to the prevalent HIV stigma. Informants also highlighted that confidentiality must be maintained throughout the whole HIVST process.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The identified facilitators and barriers from the study may be considered by the Philippine HTS program implementers. The HIVST strategy may complement the current HTS. It will be very promising to involve the MSM and TGW communities and other key populations to know their HIV status by bringing testing closer to them.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS</title>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Gathering participants and building trust to give their insights did not pose any difficulty because the community-based organization is reputable among the key populations (MSM and TGW) and HIV advocacy in the Philippines.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our study only involved respondents from the National Capital Region, which may limit its generalizability to other regions of the country where HIV cases are still increasing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Key informant interviews were done online due to the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, some reactions to the questions of the participants are not noted due to the unavailability of video.</p></list-item></list>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>It is estimated that there are 76M HIV infections, 35M Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-related fatalities, and 37M people living with HIV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Following the rapid and continued increase in new diagnoses since 2007, the Philippines has been recognized as having one of the fastest-growing HIV epidemics in the world <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the HIV epidemic in the country is rapidly changing and expanding in the last five years, in which 32 cases a day have been diagnosed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. There are 62,029 HIV cases from 1984 to 2018, of which 93&#x0025; were males and 51&#x0025; were from the age group of 25-34 years old <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The limited onward transmission of HIV can be achieved through early awareness of HIV testing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. It has been demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial wherein a 96&#x0025; reduction in HIV transmission was associated with an early diagnosis, which is a requirement to initiate treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In addition, this early awareness of testing and diagnosis accentuated the public health concern that late diagnosis of HIV is greatly affected by the health-seeking behavior of many at-risk individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There is a significant increase in HIV testing services (HTS) in which from 2010-2014, more than 600 million people received proper HTS in 122 low- and middle-income countries <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The expansion of HTS in these countries may be attributed to the increased introduction of provider-initiated testing and counseling and different community-based methodologies, which are now considered a standard of care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, despite these innovative approaches, approximately 40&#x0025; of all HIV infections remained undiagnosed globally <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, several countries have already sought approaches to encourage people to get tested for HIV and achieve the first United Nation&#x2019;s 90-90 HIV testing and treatment goals-diagnosis of 90&#x0025; of all people with HIV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The fear of discrimination, stigmatization, and access to testing remained public health concerns in many regions that persistently threaten the acceptance of HTS in the world <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has suggested HIV screening routinely for patients between ages 13 &#x2013; 64 since 2006; however, the uptake of these HTS has been obstructed by several barriers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, globally acceptable and easily accessible HTS are desirable to expand the coverage of diagnosis, which will eventually allow for early antiretroviral treatment for infected individuals. In addition, it will limit HIV transmission as well to people who are at risk <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, increasing evidence that HIV self-testing (HIVST) may help reach those unwilling to use HTS in designated centers, increasing the number of people diagnosed with HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. One study showed that 70&#x0025; of those who had ever had an HIV test also had self-tested, with privacy being the main reason <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, a well-designed and implemented HIVST program could effectively increase uptake of HIV testing with increased privacy and increasing entry into HIV prevention, care and treatment services. Additionally, HIVST could require fewer human resources and lower costs than other alternative approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) does not have any HIVST policies or guidelines to regulate HIVST kits purchased online <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Currently, a limited study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of HIVST in the Philippines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Our research focused on identifying barriers and facilitators in implementing HIVST, including the perceptions of men-having-sex-with-men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) HTS users and non-users on HIVST. Furthermore, we explored the current knowledge, practices, and potential of HIVST among the MSM and TGW populations in the National Capital Region (NCR).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<p>The study was carried out through a non-government organization, LoveYourself, Inc. (LYS), from March to May 2020 in NCR, Philippines. Qualitative methods were utilized to ascertain facilitators and barriers in implementing HIVST, explore the gaps for lack of access to HTS, and investigate HIVST uptake and linkage to further diagnosis and care among MSM and TGW.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study Participants</title>
<p>All study participants were either MSM or TGW, 18 to 49 years old, residing or working in the NCR. Participants who are biologically born female and/or currently on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications, or an HIV-positive diagnosed individual were excluded from the study. In addition, participants recruited were grouped into 4 clusters, including (1) MSM and (2) TGW who have been tested/screened for HIV at least once, and (3) MSM and (4) TGW who were never tested before for HIV for the key informant interviews (KIIs). Moreover, recruitment and referral of the KII participants were done through online platforms such as social media and referrals from LYS volunteers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data collection included semi-structured interviews with KII participants that were administered in both English and Filipino. However, due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, face-to-face conduct of KIIs was prohibited. Therefore, KIIs were conducted online through different video conferencing software, whichever was available to the participants. Questions included in the topic guide focused on three different segments. The first set of questions was focused on respondent&#x2019;s knowledge, acceptability of using HIVST, referral of HIVST to other people, and inclusion of other materials or services to make HIVST more preferable, especially to the first-time testers. The second set of questions included suggestions when it comes to the marketing and distribution of HIVST kits. It had the client&#x2019;s preference on the mechanism of getting samples (blood or oral fluids), requesting and obtaining the kits in various platforms, desired price, and suggestions on how to market HIVST and reach the MSM and TGW users. The last set focused on monitoring and tracking results, including post-counseling services, follow-up, and referral mechanisms for reactive and non-reactive results. This part also included other concerns and integration of mental health services primarily to clients who turn out reactive after using the kit. All interviews from the participants were audio-recorded and were transcribed afterward. In addition, discussions among the researchers were done post-interview to outline a plan for the data analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The study used a template analysis framework to code for qualitative interview data by generating an initial list of themes or deductive codes based on the interview topics and applying these codes to the data. Transcripts of the audio recording were indexed utilizing an analytical framework. Summarized data were inputted within a framework matrix, followed by in-depth analysis and interpretation.</p>
<p>Based on a review of the deductively coded data, inductive codes were used to flag data on themes that emerged within or across the topics. One reviewer primarily did coding following an independent coding exercise and generating consensus around a single coding framework. The team used the code reports to discuss the main ideas and explore and charted relationships among the themes. Pseudonyms were used to present quotes from qualitative findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Ethical Considerations and Data Protection</title>
<p>The research protocol of the study received ethical approval from an Independent Research Ethics Committee. The data gathered, including the participant information, were kept confidential and private following the provisions of the Data Privacy Act of 2012. The principal investigator and research team did not disclose the identities of the participants at any time. All study data were recorded, and investigators were responsible for the integrity of the data, such as accuracy, completeness, legibility, originality, timeliness, and consistency.</p>

<title>Patient and public involvement</title>
<p>Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting or dissemination plans of our research.</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>A total of twenty (20) informants were interviewed, of which 75&#x0025; were MSM, and the rest were TGW. In terms of age, the age bracket 25-35 years old had the highest proportion (55&#x0025;). In addition, one was unemployed, one was a government employee, sixteen were working in a private sector (15 full-time and one part-time), and two (2) informants were self-employed. Thirteen out of 15 MSMs had tested for HIV, while four of the 5 TGWs had already been tested. Moreover, only one informant had ever used a HIVST kit purchased through an online channel (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for details).</p>

<title>HIVST Themes</title>
<p>Different facilitators and barriers to using HIVST were identified based on the information gathered from the MSM and TGW informants. These include three primary themes: (1) acceptability, (2) distribution, and (3) monitoring and tracking (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3a1">
<title>Acceptability of HIVST</title>
<p>The knowledge about HIVST, comfort in using the HIVST kit, <underline>preference of HIVST or facility-based for HIV screening</underline>, pre-counseling for first-time testers to HIVST service, and the choice between oral fluid-based and blood-based HIVST kits were all documented as important factors for the acceptability of HIVST by the MSM and TGW communities.</p>
<sec id="s3a1a">
<title>Knowledge about HIVST</title>
<p>Informants learned about HIVST through HIV/AIDS advocacy volunteers from the testing facilities, online shopping platforms, and social media accounts. In addition, on informant mentioned that this is the first time he has heard about an organization spearheading this project.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>&#x201C;I never heard about this before, but some people I know order HIVST kits online. There are no regulations or monitoring on how to get the kits. They are doing this on their own, and they are the ones self-screening themselves. When it comes to an organization that will introduce this, this is the first time I heard about this</italic>.<italic>&#x201D; - [MSM1]</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Most of the informants said HIVST is convenient and saves time. In addition, some informants described HIVST as &#x201C;discreet&#x201D; and &#x201C;very confidential.&#x201D;</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve heard about it and find it okay. It will save your time, especially in traveling to visit the center, and good for those who are shy to visit the center. When I had my first test, it was not easy for me to visit the center. The self-testing kit is good. - [MSM2]</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In contrast, informants who do not know HIVST said HIVST is convenient but concerned about the HIVST results and what to do after.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>&#x201C;This is helpful because each person has different personalities, and not everyone is brave enough to know their status in a community center&#x2026; like a person who will use the kit but may not be knowledgeable enough and may not be ready to know their HIV status</italic>.<italic>&#x201D; - [TGW4]</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
</sec>
<sec id="s3a1b">
<title>Comfort in using the HIVST Kits</title>
<p>Most of the informants were comfortable using the HIVST kit, while others were not. The uncomfortable participants said that readiness to know the result, emotional stability of the person using it, and preference for counseling sessions first before conducting the HIVST influenced their confidence in using the kit.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>&#x201C;My concern is about the readiness of the client. Are they strong enough to find out the result? Sometimes, it&#x2019;s still difficult, even if there is a counselor who will guide them. It might lead to something that we do not want to happen. HIVST kit is good, but there must be a set of qualifications before giving the kit to anyone interested&#x201D; - [MSM2]</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
</sec>
<sec id="s3a1c">
<title>Preference of HIVST or facility-based for HIV screening</title>
<p>Some informants preferred HIVST over facility-based HIV screening for the following reasons: proximity to testing facilities, decongestion of testing centers, and privacy.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m looking into the concern of those people who live far away from any testing centers. HIVST will help us reach those people. HIVST can also be offered not only to the LGBTQIA community but also to cisgender people</italic>.<italic>&#x201D; - [TGW2]</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Conversely, informants, who preferred facility-based screening, have the following reasons: the availability of psychosocial help and proper knowledge and assistance provided to the clients, affordability, the accuracy of the result, and convenience.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>&#x201C;I prefer testing in the facility because there are counselors that will assist me just in case it turns out reactive. The people in the facility will make you feel that you are worthy even if it turns out reactive</italic>.<italic>&#x201D; - [TGW4]</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In addition, HIVST must be offered alongside other screening methods to every client. One informant articulated that he would use HIVST for the sake of his &#x201C;sanity,&#x201D; whereas he will use different methods of screening for validation purposes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3a1d">
<title>Pre-counseling service for first-time HIVST testers</title>
<p>Most participants agreed that pre-counseling should be provided as part of HIVST service for first-timers, while some said it should be optional. In addition, they noted that pre-screening counseling is necessary, and a hotline or a website must be provided in case the client wants to seek help on how to use the kit.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>&#x201C;We have to take into consideration the emotional and mental health of a person. Know first if they are capable enough to handle the situation and the result. Pre-counseling may be given if they did not meet the requirements needed. However, some people may feel uncomfortable in counseling. It must be optional, and it depends on the preference of the person</italic>.<italic>&#x201D; - [MSM 14]</italic></p>
<p><italic>&#x201C;At least give a hotline to report the result and educate them on what to do next. It must be included in the instructional manual. Pre-screening counseling may be done; there must be a conversation first</italic>.<italic>&#x201D; - [TGW1]</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
</sec>
<sec id="s3a1e">
<title>Oral fluid-based vs. Blood-based HIVST kits</title>
<p>Most participants preferred blood-based HIVST kits than opting for oral fluid-based kits. Accuracy and reliability were the reasons for those participants who chose the blood-based kits. Alternatively, informants who chose oral fluid-based kits were afraid of needles but claimed that the kits were easier to administer.</p>
<disp-quote>

<title>Distribution of HIVST kits</title>
<p>The most efficient and appropriate ways to distribute HIVST kits to respondents in NCR, Philippines, were identified.</p>
<sec id="s3a2a">
<title>Requisition of HIVST kit</title>
<p>Most informants said that clients could request an HIVST kit through a website and a mobile application. In addition, other means of ordering an HIVST kit may include the use of social media, community centers with riders, pharmacies, and call and/or text-based services.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m thinking of the best way for the masses to order the kit.

<title>Obtaining HIVST kit and desired price</title>
<p>Most respondents wish to obtain their kits through an online courier service. However, other distribution channels like pharmacies, health facilities, vending machines, partnerships with organizations, and pick-up from an individual staff were also identified.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>&#x201C;Courier delivery is the best for me because what I am looking at are accessibility and anonymity</italic>&#x2026; <italic>It is better if the kit will be delivered to the comfort of your home.

</disp-quote>
<p>Packaging and delivery of the kits is another concern: how to order the kits, discreet packaging, readability, and friendly tone of the inserts. Furthermore, for the desired price of the HIVST kit, between 50.00 to 300.00, Philippine Peso (PHP) (USD 1-6) was the most preferred price range.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>&#x201C;The desired price must be at least the price of a pregnancy test kit or at least the price of 3 boxes of condoms. It must be around Php. 150</italic>.<italic>00.

<p>Most of the informants agreed that social media platforms should be utilized to reach the HIVST targeted population.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Currently, there are four programs against the HIV epidemic: (1) precaution, (2) screening or diagnosing for HIV, (3) antiretroviral treatment (ART), and (4) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The increase in the incidence of specific diseases is attributed to the population&#x2019;s active participation in disease screening. Private and government hospitals, non-government organizations, and social hygiene clinics (SHC) offer HIV testing and counseling (HTC) services in the Philippines. However, in a recent report of the Philippine Department of Health, the MSM population still has a record of 78&#x0025; not being tested for HIV. About 30&#x0025; of 22&#x0025; who got tested for HIV reported being comfortable going SHC to avail HTC services <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Primary care physicians described the social stigma associated with HIV, the conservative nature of some communities, and the lack of privacy available as barriers to HIV testing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The need to expand the HTC service options in the Philippines for MSM is crucial, especially in highly stigmatized environments. HIVST provides a choice to testing aside from the facility-based screening. This complementary approach can increase HTC services uptake and frequency, thereby increasing early HIV detection and prevention of new infections and early linkage to care <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our qualitative study confirmed the acceptability of HIVST among the target populations, specifically those at risk of contracting HIV, the MSMs, and the TGWs. Acceptability of HIVST kits among the informants revolved around various strata of concerns, including current knowledge about HIVST, comfort in using kits, preference of HIVST over facility-based screening, and oral-based vs. blood-based kits. Informants welcomed establishing an HIVST system and recognized that the system would expand the reach for HIV screening. In most countries, the acceptability of HIVST is high. In Malawi, the acceptability of HIVST offered at home with minimal supervision was noted to be high <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Furthermore, at least 67&#x0025; of the high-risk MSM population in the United States reported the utilization of HIVST <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In Mpumalanga, South Africa, researchers documented high uptake and acceptability of HIVST following the distribution of the kits to MSM populations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In addition, a recent study in Australia demonstrated that populations at-risk for HIV infection tested twice using HIVST compared to the at-risk populations offered with clinic-based screening <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The results shown in other countries agreed with our findings on the acceptability of HIVST.</p>
<p>Moreover, the knowledge on HIVST of the participants came from the SHCs, social media, and online shopping. Studies in China have demonstrated how online sites provide information on HIVST, including informational videos and basic counseling. The information these sites are gearing was towards the promotion of HIVST <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Online shopping is also one of the biggest platforms to display information on HIVST in China. However, the purchase of HIVST through online shopping entails a lack of quality assurance and monitoring. The HIVSTK sold online also posits questionable integrity and accuracy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The framework on the checking of quality assurance of HIVSTK being sold online should be developed following the existing rules and regulations of the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure accurate reporting of HIV cases in the Philippines. This should be thoroughly considered in the future.</p>
<p>Our study also presented constraints and opportunities in terms of the distribution of HIVSTK. Social media is the best way to acquire these kits and can be delivered through established courier companies but with the utmost confidentiality. The use of social media has already increased the reach for HIVST, which provided new avenues to target testing among the key populations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Different platforms on smartphones such as Grindr, Facebook, and Twitter have been determined to effectively reach the MSM, and TGW populations tested using HIVST <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Using social media to promote HIVST facilitated overcoming constraints when being tested in a facility such as privacy or possible leak of data on sexual orientation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In addition, other countries use different online platforms to promote and distribute HIVSTK among MSMs and TGWs, such as WhatsApp in Nigeria, which presented data that there was an increase in the uptake of testing among MSMs when HIVSTK was promoted using WhatsApp <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In China, WeChat has been steadily utilized to deploy HIVST projects; the MSM population in China trusts this messaging platform <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The possible use of different social media platforms to target MSMs and TGWs in the Philippines to increase uptake and distribution of HIVSTK should be explored immediately.</p>
<p>It is also notable that the distribution of HIVSTK is highly dependable on the possible price of HIVSTK in the future once it is available. Our study observed a suggested price range for HIVSTK of Php 50-300 (USD 1-6) as preferred by most respondents. Additionally, the mechanisms of the government to increase the uptake of testing using HIVST can be achieved if a reduced price for the kits is realized. This strategy can be accomplished if manufacturers and sponsors will partner with key health stakeholders in the country. Low costs HIVSTK will develop confidence about the availability of affordable kits in the future <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Past experiences suggested that HIVSTK costing about USD 3 could save USD 53 million over 20 years using a cost-effective analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Furthermore, affordable HIVSTK may potentially increase testing among key populations tied up with low-cost interventions among HIV-positive individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. The wealth of evidence and data presents many factors to be considered in developing algorithms and models to implement HIVST in the Philippines fully; further explorations of these factors are needed to strengthen the future HIVST scaled-up implementation.</p>
<p>The gap between the result of HIVST and the services after using HIVSTK needs to be addressed. The third theme presented in our qualitative study suggested that monitoring and uptake of HTC services after using the kits are essential parameters to be considered. Reporting results should be standardized, and post-counseling services should be made available for reactive and non-reactive clients, highlighting mental health services as the main HIV/AIDS awareness program. One research described their HIVST reporting algorithm wherein kits were ordered online to be delivered through mail or self-pickup at a chosen pharmacy with a random personal identification number (PIN) to track future distribution and requests. The assigned PIN also anonymized clients to report their results online and monitor subsequent linkage to further HTC services <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. The need for confirmatory testing, post-counseling services, and immediate linkage to care are important after receiving a reactive HIVST result. Other studies also raised concerns on HIVST, particularly whether post-counseling after testing should be done face-to-face to not exacerbate negative behaviors and unfavorable consequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Reservations on HIVST have also been expressed, including emotions after a reactive result and misuse of the kits. The lack of supervision and post-counseling is inbuilt to HIVST, and distress on mental health is possible <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, the need for a robust mental health program complementing HIVST implementation is vital, as verified by the information gathered from the respondents.</p>
<p>The failed attempt of the government to address the constant increase of HIV incidence in the Philippines prompted lawmakers to enhance its current HIV/AIDS law to provide a better response to this epidemic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. As the epidemic of HIV persistently grows, the introduction of HIVST to complement facility-based screening might offer a new advantage in increasing the number of people getting tested and being aware of their HIV status. A recent study concluded that strategic cooperation between the Philippine stakeholders to deliver a patient-centered HIVST program to escalate testing coverage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Our study, which offered substantial data regarding facilitators and barriers to HIVST implementation, may be adopted by policymakers and HIV program implementors to introduce a standardized way to cascade HIVST from the national to the local levels. There is no known single protocol to give an accurate and precise way to link HIVST usage and HTC services due to several limitations. However, information regarding identified factors in reducing possible limitations of HIVST implementation can increase the confidence and minimize the possibility of implementation failure, as evident from the data our study presented.</p>
<p>The results of our research stemmed out from the use of a local network of the identified community organization. This community organization is popular among the key populations (MSM and TGW) and in HIV advocacy in the country; thus, trust between the participants and the researchers to give insights regarding HIVST has already been built. However, our study only utilized respondents from NCR, which may limit its generalizability to other regions of the country where HIV cases are still growing. Furthermore, our study only captured the MSM and TGW populations and did not include other at-risk populations; future studies on other at-risk populations are needed further to validate our theoretical acceptability of HIVST in the Philippines. In addition, future investigation is required to identify strategies to support linkage to prevention and treatment services. Finally, quantitative studies may be conducted to triangulate our findings and validate the necessary factors to implement HIVST in the country. These studies would eventually enable the implementers and key stakeholders to assess the potential public health impact and cost-effectiveness of HIVST in the future.</p>

<title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>New HIV testing modalities must be introduced to reach more people in knowing their HIV status and access prevention packages or treatment if needed. This study aimed to understand the acceptability and feasibility of HIVST services as an innovative testing modality to MSMs and TGWs within NCR. The study revealed some important points that need to be prioritized to implement HIVST programs in the country. First, HIVST must be a part of the national priority to reach more people that the current HIV testing modalities cannot reach. Second, to have a patient-centered HIVST program in the country and cope with the changing times, the implementers must utilize and strengthen online platforms because this is an effective way to reach and offer HIVST to the hard-to-reach at-risk populations. Third, the HIVST program must also be coupled with more mechanisms to ensure patient confidentiality throughout the process. Lastly, standard monitoring, counseling, and linkage to care services must be provided to guarantee the next steps the clients must undertake regardless of their HIVST results. Given all these requirements that need to be considered in the implementation, an HIVST integrated program will be very promising to engage more people in knowing their HIV status.</p>
