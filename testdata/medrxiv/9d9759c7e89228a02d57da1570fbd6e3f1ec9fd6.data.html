<meta name="DC.Description" content="Background &amp; Objectives Sofosbuvir (SOF) and daclatasvir (DCV) in combination with ribavirin (RBV) drastically changed the treatment scenario of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients, achieving remarkable efficacy and safety profile. Real world experience of SOF/DCV/RBV combination in this part of Asia was scant. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SOF/DCV/RBV combination to treat CHC patients at a tertiary care hospital in South Punjab.

Methods Patients of CHC of any genotype were enrolled prospectively. They were treated with 12 weeks course of SOF/DCV/RBV combination. Effectiveness was evaluated by end of treatment response (ETR) and sustained virological response (SVR) at 12 and 24 weeks post-treatment. Adverse events were recorded for safety analysis.

Results We analyzed data of 102 patients of CHC (40 males and 62 females). The mean age was 40.04 + 10.22 years. Mean weight was 67.24 + 11.78 kg, while mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.32 + 4.58 kg/m2. Eighty patients belonged to low socio-economic status, while 22 belonged to middle socio-economic status. Sixty-four had a rural background, while 38 were from urban background. Seventy-four patients had no co-morbid condition; 16 (15.7%) had diabetes and 12 (11.8%) patients had co-morbid hypertension. Ninety percent of the patients did not have cirrhosis; 6% had compensated liver disease, while 4 % had decompensated liver disease. All the patients achieved undetectable HCV RNA at the end of treatment and 12 weeks after completion of treatment, while SVR at 24 weeks was achieved in 98% of patients. Only 2 patients discontinued treatment as a result of side effects. The most common side effects reported include fatigue, headache and fever.

Conclusion CHC is a grave problem in developing countries like Pakistan. The SOF/DCV/RBV combination is very effective in eradicating CHC and has a very good side effect profile as well.

Real world experience of SOF/DCV/RBV combination in this part of Asia was scant. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SOF/DCV/RBV combination to treat CHC patients at a tertiary care hospital in South Punjab.</p></div><div id="sec-2" class="subsection"><p id="p-3"><strong>Methods</strong> Patients of CHC of any genotype were enrolled prospectively. They were treated with 12 weeks course of SOF/DCV/RBV combination. Effectiveness was evaluated by end of treatment response (ETR) and sustained virological response (SVR) at 12 and 24 weeks post-treatment. Adverse events were recorded for safety analysis.</p></div><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><p id="p-4"><strong>Results</strong> We analyzed data of 102 patients of CHC (40 males and 62 females). The mean age was 40.04 <span class="underline">+</span> 10.22 years. Mean weight was 67.24 <span class="underline">+</span> 11.78 kg, while mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.32 <span class="underline">+</span> 4.58 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Eighty patients belonged to low socio-economic status, while 22 belonged to middle socio-economic status. Sixty-four had a rural background, while 38 were from urban background. Seventy-four patients had no co-morbid condition; 16 (15.7%) had diabetes and 12 (11.8%) patients had co-morbid hypertension. Ninety percent of the patients did not have cirrhosis; 6% had compensated liver disease, while 4 % had decompensated liver disease. All the patients achieved undetectable HCV RNA at the end of treatment and 12 weeks after completion of treatment, while SVR at 24 weeks was achieved in 98% of patients. Only 2 patients discontinued treatment as a result of side effects. The most common side effects reported include fatigue, headache and fever.</p></div><div id="sec-4" class="subsection"><p id="p-5"><strong>Conclusion</strong> CHC is a grave problem in developing countries like Pakistan. The SOF/DCV/RBV combination is very effective in eradicating CHC and has a very good side effect profile as well.</p></div></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-6">The authors have declared no competing interest.</p><h3>Funding Statement</h3><p id="p-7">This study did not receive any funding.</p><h3>Author Declarations</h3><p id="p-8">I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.</p><p id="p-9">Yes</p><p id="p-10">The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:</p><p id="p-11">Ethical Review Board of Nishtar Medical University and Hospital gave ethical approval for this work (IRB No. 26880-935/NMU&amp;H dated 10-10-2019)</p><p id="p-12">I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.</p><p id="p-13">Yes</p><p id="p-14">I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
