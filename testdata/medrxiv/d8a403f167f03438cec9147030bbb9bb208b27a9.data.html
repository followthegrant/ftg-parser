<meta name="DC.Description" content="Aims Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) is the primary causative agent of peptic ulcer in multiple developing countries, including Bangladesh. This study was designed to investigate the diagnostic value of a rapid immunochromatography-based H. Pylori stool antigen (HpSAg) test to screen H. pylori infection in Bangladeshi population.

Methodology and results A total of 140 suspected peptic ulcer patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at Chittagong Medical College and Hospital, Chattogram, Bangladesh, were included in the study. Histopathology, Rapid Urease Test (RUT), and Microscopic examination of the stained smears were conducted to define H. pylori positive cases. Later, stool antigen detection test was done in H. pylori positive status group, H. pylori negative status group, indeterminate status group, and healthy controls. Out of 140 peptic ulcer suspected patients, 75 (53.6%) patients were confirmed to have peptic ulcer or erosions. Although the proportion of antral erosion was 57.4% in patients who were below 40 years, the proportion decreased to 23.4% in patients over 40 years. Patients over 40 years were mostly suffering from Prepyloric erosion (42.9%). All peptic ulcer patients were also positive on histopathological analysis. However, micorscopic grading of curved bacilli and RUT found 93.3% (70/75) and 89.3% (67/75) patients positive, respectively. High sensitivity (95%), specificity (80%), and diagnostic accuracy (91%) scores for HpSAg assay was obtained in our study.

Conclusions, significance and impact of studies The HpSAg test, for a comparatively less sophisticated assay, can be efficient in detecting the presence of H. pylori pre-and post-therapy and provide more valid test results than other invasive test methods.

This study was designed to investigate the diagnostic value of a rapid immunochromatography-based <em>H. Pylori</em> stool antigen (HpSAg) test to screen <em>H. pylori</em> infection in Bangladeshi population.</p></div><div id="sec-2" class="subsection"><p id="p-3"><strong>Methodology and results</strong> A total of 140 suspected peptic ulcer patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at Chittagong Medical College and Hospital, Chattogram, Bangladesh, were included in the study. Histopathology, Rapid Urease Test (RUT), and Microscopic examination of the stained smears were conducted to define <em>H. pylori</em> positive cases. Later, stool antigen detection test was done in H. <em>pylori</em> positive status group, <em>H. pylori</em> negative status group, indeterminate status group, and healthy controls. Out of 140 peptic ulcer suspected patients, 75 (53.6%) patients were confirmed to have peptic ulcer or erosions. Although the proportion of antral erosion was 57.4% in patients who were below 40 years, the proportion decreased to 23.4% in patients over 40 years. Patients over 40 years were mostly suffering from Prepyloric erosion (42.9%). All peptic ulcer patients were also positive on histopathological analysis. However, micorscopic grading of curved bacilli and RUT found 93.3% (70/75) and 89.3% (67/75) patients positive, respectively. High sensitivity (95%), specificity (80%), and diagnostic accuracy (91%) scores for HpSAg assay was obtained in our study.</p></div><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><p id="p-4"><strong>Conclusions, significance and impact of studies</strong> The HpSAg test, for a comparatively less sophisticated assay, can be efficient in detecting the presence of <em>H. pylori</em> pre-and post-therapy and provide more valid test results than other invasive test methods.</p></div></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-5">The authors have declared no competing interest.</p><h3>Funding Statement</h3><p id="p-6">This study did not receive any funding</p><h3>Author Declarations</h3><p id="p-7">I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.</p><p id="p-8">Yes</p><p id="p-9">The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:</p><p id="p-10">Ethics committee of Chattogram, Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), Chattogram gave ethical approval for this work.</p><p id="p-11">I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.</p><p id="p-12">Yes</p><p id="p-13">I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
