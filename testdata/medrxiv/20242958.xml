<title>Abstract</title>
<p>As the number of new and recovering cases continues to rise, it is increasingly important to understand the long-term impacts of COVID-19 beyond the time of active SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the clinical and molecular biomarkers characterizing patients who are likely to experience longer lasting effects after clearing SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known. We have found that COVID-19 patients hospitalized after confirmed viral clearance tended to have lower hemoglobin and hematocrit measurements both during their SARS-CoV-2 positive intervals and during the one year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis compared to patients who have not been rehospitalized after viral clearance. Further, outright laboratory-based diagnosis of moderate or severe anemia was strongly enriched in the hospitalized cohort, suggesting that anemia pre-dating or concurrent with SARS-CoV-2 infection may predispose patients to long-term complications of COVID-19. Interventions which may mitigate anemia did not reduce the risk of post clearance hospitalization, although the efficacy of and patient compliance with these interventions could not be established. This study demonstrates the value of integrated large-scale EHR analyses and highlights the need for further research to determine whether the prevention or mitigation of anemia during SARS-CoV-2 infection may reduce the risk of suffering long-term complications of COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the first diagnosed case of COVID-19 in December 2019, over 50 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide resulting in over 1.25 million deaths ([<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). While significant progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, including the rapid development and clinical testing of multiple vaccine candidates ([<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) along with detailed characterizations of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 ([<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], [<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), there are still few options available for effective treatment of patients with severe COVID-19. Further, as the pandemic has progressed, there have been reports of long-lasting effects of COVID-19 even in patients who did not experience a severe disease course during their active period of infection ([<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], [<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], [<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). However, the clinical, molecular, and/or demographic biomarkers characterizing patients who are more likely to experience these lasting effects after clearing SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.</p>
<p>The need to answer such questions during the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the requirement for tools facilitating real-time analysis of patient data as it is obtained and stored in large electronic health records (EHR) systems. Specifically, clinical research efforts to understand the features defining COVID-19 patients, or subsets thereof, fundamentally require reliable systems that enable (1) conversion of unstructured information (e.g., patients notes written by healthcare professionals) into structured formats suitable for downstream analysis and (2) temporal alignment and integration of such unstructured data with the already structured information available in EHR databases (e.g., lab test results, disease diagnosis codes).</p>
<p>With these requirements in mind, we have previously reported the development of augmented curation methods that enable the rapid creation and comparison of defined cohorts of COVID-19 patients within a large EHR system ([<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], [<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). Here we expand on our prior textual sentiment-based analysis ([<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) to understand the clinical features of patients likely to experience lasting effects of COVID-19, and we find that lab tests corroborate our previous results suggesting that anemia and kidney malfunction during active SARS-CoV-2 infection may serve as biomarkers of patients who are more likely to be subsequently hospitalized after PCR-confirmed viral clearance.</p>

<title>Definition of COVID-19 cohorts based on hospitalization after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 clearance</title>
<p>Using NLP-based extraction of phenotypes from a large EHR system, we previously reported that COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized after viral clearance (as assessed by RT-PCR) were more likely to experience anemia and acute kidney injury (AKI) in the year prior to their diagnosis and during their PCR-positive phase of COVID-19 compared to patients who were not re-hospitalized after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 ([<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Here, we sought to assess whether diagnostic lab tests for AKI and anemia corroborate these phenotypic associations. As was previously described, we split the cohort of COVID-19 patients with confirmed viral clearance into two groups: (1) post-clearance hospitalized (&#x201C;PCH&#x201D;; n = 93) and (2) post-clearance non-hospitalized (&#x201C;PCNH&#x201D;; n = 173), where viral clearance was defined as two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests following a positive test. A demographic summarization of these two cohorts is provided in <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>.</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 1.</label>
<caption><p>Demographics and clinical characteristics of study cohorts, including patients who were and who were not hospitalized after PCR-confirmed clearance of SARS-CoV-2. The &#x201C;Hospitalized post-clearance&#x201D; cohort is composed of patients who were admitted or readmitted to the hospital following the estimated clearance date of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The &#x201C;non-hospitalized post-clearance&#x201D; cohort is composed of patients who were not admitted to the hospital following the estimated clearance date. Each demographic variable or clinical characteristic was tested for difference in proportion with a Fisher Exact test or a difference in magnitude (for continuous variables) using a Mann-Whitney U test, and p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="20242958v2_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>To reduce imbalances between cohorts based on initial infection severity, our cohort inclusion criteria required patients in the PCNH cohort (n = 173) to have been admitted to the hospital during their index infection (i.e. while positive for SARS-CoV-2), while it did not require the same for patients in the PCH cohort (only 49 of 93 were hospitalized during index infection). To assess whether the severity of the index infection differed between these groups, we used ICU admission rates as a surrogate of clinical severity. When considering all patients, the rate of ICU admission was similar in the two cohorts (26/93 [28&#x0025;] vs. 57/173 [33&#x0025;]; p = 0.49; <bold>Figure S1A</bold>), but when considering only patients who were hospitalized during index infection, the PCH cohort had a significantly higher rate of ICU admission (26/49 [53&#x0025;] vs. 57/173 [33&#x0025;]; p = 0.01; <bold>Figure S1B</bold>). Since the patients who were hospitalized during index infection will inherently provide more lab testing data, it will be important in our subsequent analyses to evaluate whether lab test features distinguishing these cohorts are independent of this difference in ICU admission rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Lab tests indicate that patients hospitalized after viral clearance are more likely to experience anemia and kidney dysfunction before and during their SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
<p>After creating these two cohorts, we then compared a set of selected lab test results during two time windows: (1) the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and (2) the time during which each patient was SARS-CoV-2 positive according to their RT-PCR results. Given our previous EHR-based findings, we considered both anemia-related and kidney function lab tests including hemoglobin, hematocrit, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, and serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<caption><p>Schematic summarizing cohort creation and lab test analyses. (A) Time intervals (&#x201C;phases&#x201D;) were defined based on SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing results. The pre-COVID phase refers to the one year prior to the date of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The SARS-CoV-2 positive interval refers to the time between the first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and the second consecutive negative PCR test. The post-viral clearance phase refers to the time after this second consecutive negative PCR test. (B) From the 1355 patients who were diagnosed by PCR with COVID-19 and subsequently confirmed to have cleared SARS-CoV-2 with two consecutive negative tests, we created two cohorts: (1) patients who were hospitalized during their index infection and not hospitalized after confirmed viral clearance (n = 173), and (2) patients who were hospitalized at some point after confirmed viral clearance (n = 93).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>For each patient, we first considered the median values of the given lab test over the designated interval. Histograms showing the number of measurements per patient in each time period for the selected tests are shown in <bold>Figures S2-S3</bold>. Consistent with our previous findings, we found that patients in the PCH cohort showed significantly lower median hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in both the pre-COVID and the SARS-CoV-2 positive phases (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A-D</xref></bold>). In the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase, median eGFR was lower and median BUN was higher in the PCH cohort, but there were no significant differences in renal function test results between the cohorts in the pre-COVID phase (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Figure S4</bold>).</p>

Red shading indicates normal ranges for hemoglobin and hematocrit; as these ranges are lower for females than males, the shaded range here spans from the lower limit of normal for females (12 g/dL hemoglobin, 35.5&#x0025; hematocrit) to the upper limit of normal for males (17.5 g/dL hemoglobin, 48.6&#x0025; hematocrit).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="20242958v2_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We also tested whether extreme (i.e. minimum or maximum) values of a given lab test over the designated periods varied between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, as a measure of central tendency (e.g., median) may fail to capture a single occurrence of phenotypes such as anemia or AKI. Specifically, we compared the patient-level minimum values of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and eGFR, and maximum values of serum creatinine and BUN in each time period. Interestingly, we found that the PCH cohort tended to have lower minimum values of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and eGFR in both the pre-COVID and SARS-CoV-2 positive phases, while also showing higher maximum serum BUN and creatinine during the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase (<bold><xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and Figure S5</bold>).</p>

Red shading indicates normal ranges for hemoglobin and hematocrit; as these ranges are lower for females than males, the shaded range here spans from the lower limit of normal for females (12 g/dL hemoglobin, 35.5&#x0025; hematocrit) to the upper limit of normal for males (17.5 g/dL hemoglobin, 48.6&#x0025; hematocrit).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="20242958v2_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To consider a simple explanation, we asked whether these reductions in hemoglobin and hematocrit during the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase could be attributed to more frequent blood draws or higher ICU admission rates in PCH patients compared to their PCNH counterparts, but this was not the case. Specifically, there was no significant difference in the number of blood draws experienced by these cohorts during this interval (<bold>Figure S6A</bold>). And while patients admitted to the ICU during SARS-CoV-2 index infection tended to have slightly lower hemoglobin values compared to non-ICU admitted patients (cohen&#x2019;s D = &#x2212;0.283, p = 0.022; <bold>Figure S7</bold>), the difference was much stronger when comparing the PCH and PCNH cohorts (cohen&#x2019;s D = &#x2212;0.70, p = 7.51&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>; <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). This indicates that the observed reduction in hemoglobin among PCH patients during the SARS-CoV-2 positive interval cannot be explained simply by their higher ICU admission rate during index infection (<bold>Figure S1B</bold>). Taken together, these analyses corroborate our prior textual sentiment-based EHR findings, suggesting that patients who are hospitalized after SARS-CoV-2 clearance are more likely to experience anemia and kidney malfunction both prior to and during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Both male and female rehospitalized COVID-19 patients have lower hemoglobin and hematocrit measurements compared to patients who are not rehospitalized</title>
<p>Given that males and females have different normal ranges of hemoglobin and hematocrit, it was important to consider whether our observation was related to an imbalance in sex distributions between the PCH and PCNH cohorts. As seen in <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>, this was especially important as the PCH cohort was indeed enriched for female patients (57/93 [61.3&#x0025;]) compared to the PCNH cohort (71/173 [41&#x0025;]).</p>
<p>To address this concern, we repeated our analysis of anemia lab tests split by sex. We found that patient-level median values of both hemoglobin and hematocrit during the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase were still significantly lower in both the male and female PCH cohorts versus their PCNH counterparts (<bold><xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A-D</xref></bold>). Further, the pre-COVID median measurements of hematocrit and hemoglobin were lower in the female PCH cohort, although this was not the case among males (<bold><xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E-H</xref></bold>). Similarly, in our analysis of extreme values, both male and female PCH patients showed lower minimum measurements of hemoglobin and hematocrit during the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase (<bold><xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4I-L</xref></bold>), while only females showed lower measurements in the pre-COVID phase (<bold><xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4M-P</xref></bold>). We again confirmed that the reductions observed during the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase were not attributable to more frequent blood draws, as there was no significant difference in the number of blood draws per patient between these cohorts when split by sex (<bold>Figures S2B-C</bold>).</p>

<title>Rehospitalized patients are more likely to have experienced moderate or severe anemia prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and during active COVID-19 infection</title>
<p>The previous analyses have relied simply on the comparison of continuous lab test measurements between two cohorts without clinical interpretations of those measurements. However, given that anemia can be defined based on the lab tests we have considered, we next sought to determine whether the outright diagnosis of anemia occurs more frequently in the PCH cohort than the PCNH cohort. To do so, we identified every case of clinical anemia (defined as hemoglobin &#x003C; 13.5 g/dL or hematocrit &#x003C; 38.3&#x0025; for males, and hemoglobin &#x003C; 12.0 g/dL or hematocrit &#x003C; 35.5&#x0025; for females) for each patient in the pre-COVID and SARS-CoV-2 positive phases. Patients were then classified in a binary fashion for each time window based on whether the median of their pre-COVID phase measurements or the minimum of their SARS-CoV-2 positive phase measurements met the above criteria for laboratory-diagnosed anemia (defined as &#x201C;pre-COVID anemia&#x201D; and &#x201C;SARS-CoV-2 positive anemia&#x201D;, respectively) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). We found that anemia was observed more frequently in the PCH cohort during both the pre-COVID phase (27/42 [64&#x0025;] vs. 23/65 [35&#x0025;]; OR = 1.82; p = 0.005) and the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase (53/62 [85&#x0025;] vs. 123/167 [74&#x0025;]; OR = 1.16; p = 0.077), although the latter finding did not reach statistical significance (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B-C</xref></bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Anemia can be further characterized as mild, moderate, or severe based on hemoglobin measurements, where a hemoglobin level &#x003C;10 g/dL is consistent with moderate or severe disease for both males and females. We thus performed a similar analysis to the one described above, but classified patients in a binary fashion for each time window based on whether the median of their pre-COVID phase hemoglobin measurements or the minimum of their SARS-CoV-2 positive phase measurements was &#x003C;10g/dL. Here we found that moderate/severe anemia was observed more frequently in the PCH cohort during both the pre-COVID phase (7/42 [17&#x0025;] vs. 2/65 [3&#x0025;]; OR = 5.42; p = 0.027) and the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase (33/62 [53&#x0025;] vs. 36/167 [22&#x0025;]; OR = 2.47; p = 8.2&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D-E</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Again it was important to assess whether this strong enrichment for moderate/severe anemia in PCH patients during the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase was related to or independent of index infection severity as estimated by ICU admission status. We found that among patients admitted to the ICU during index infection, the prevalence of moderate or severe anemia in the PCH cohort was 77&#x0025; (20/26) compared to 30&#x0025; (16/53) in the PCNH cohort (OR = 2.55; p = 1.11&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup>; <bold>Figure S8A</bold>); among those not admitted to the ICU during index infection, the prevalence of moderate or severe anemia was 36&#x0025; (13/36) in the PCH cohort versus 18&#x0025; (20/114) in the PCNH cohort (OR = 2.06; p = 0.036 <bold>Figure S8B</bold>). Thus, it seems that the occurrence of moderate or severe anemia during the SARS-CoV-2 positive interval is strongly associated with post-clearance hospitalization status regardless of index infection severity.</p>
<p>Given these findings, we evaluated whether therapeutic interventions to treat moderate or severe anemia prior to or during COVID-19 infection provided any protective effect against post clearance hospitalization. We classified all patients with moderate or severe anemia on the basis of whether they received any anemia-targeted intervention during the respective time interval. Anemia-targeted interventions included vitamin or mineral supplementation (iron, vitamin B12, multivitamins), recombinant erythropoietin, and red blood cell transfusions. We found that patients who were administered one or more of these interventions were hospitalized after viral clearance at similar rates to patients who did not receive them in both the pre-COVID phase (5/7 [71&#x0025;] vs. 2/2 [100&#x0025;]; OR = 0.71; p = 1.0) and SARS-CoV-2 positive phase (26/52 [50&#x0025;] vs. 7/17 [41&#x0025;]; OR = 1.091; p = 0.59) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5F-G</xref></bold>). It is important to note that both of these analyses (especially that of the pre-COVID phase) were limited due to the small total number of patients with moderate or severe anemia in these time periods (n = 9 for pre-COVID, 69 for SARS-CoV-2 positive).</p>
<p>Taken together, we conclude the following about COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized after viral clearance (PCH patients) compared to those who are not (PCNH patients): (1) they tend to have lower hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and during active COVID-19 infection, (2) they are more likely to be diagnosed with moderate or severe anemia during both intervals; and (3) anemia-mitigating interventions in the hospital setting do not appear to reduce the risk of post clearance hospitalization.</p>

<title>Prior diagnosis of acute kidney injury is not associated with rehospitalization status in COVID-19 patients</title>
<p>Given that AKI is not defined by static lab measurements, but rather by changes in measurements (e.g. serum creatinine) over time, we next classified patients on the basis of whether they experienced laboratory-confirmed AKI during the pre-COVID and/or SARS-CoV-2 positive intervals. Specifically, we referred to the creatinine-related components of the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria for diagnosis and staging of AKI in adults: stage 1 AKI is characterized by an increase in serum creatinine by &#x2265;0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or an increase in serum creatinine to &#x2265;1.5x the baseline value (known or assumed to have occurred within the last 7 days); stage 2 AKI is characterized by an increase in serum creatinine to &#x2265;2x the baseline value; and stage 3 AKI is characterized by an increase in serum creatinine to &#x2265;3x the baseline value or to &#x2265;4 mg/dL (<bold>Figure S9A</bold>).</p>
<p>We then used our longitudinal lab testing data to identify all instances meeting these criteria for each patient, and we compared the number of patients in the PCH and PCNH cohorts who did and did not experience AKI during the pre-COVID phase and during the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase. This analysis showed that similar fractions of patients in the two cohorts experienced any stage AKI during the pre-COVID phase (2/28 [7&#x0025;] vs 6/53 [11&#x0025;]; OR = 0.63; p = 0.71) (<bold>Figure S9B</bold>). In the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase, the rate of AKI was slightly higher in the PCH cohort, but this finding was not statistically significant (15/38 [39&#x0025;] vs. 23/92 [25&#x0025;]; OR = 1.58; p = 0.14) (<bold>Figure S9C</bold>).</p>
<p>Similar to our previous anemia analysis, we also asked whether the rate of moderate/severe AKI varied between these two cohorts. Here we found that stage 2&#x002B; AKI was slightly more common in the PCH cohort during both the pre-COVID (4/28 [14&#x0025;] vs. 3/53 [6&#x0025;]; OR = 2.52; p = 0.23) and SARS-CoV-2 positive (6/38 [16&#x0025;] vs. 7/92 [8&#x0025;]; OR = 2.08; p = 0.20) phases, but again these associations were not statistically significant (<bold>Figure S9D-E</bold>). Intriguingly when split by sex, we found that male PCH patients were more likely to experience stage 2&#x002B; AKI in both the pre-COVID (3/14 [21&#x0025;] vs. 1/31 [3&#x0025;]; OR = 6.64; p = 0.08) and SARS-CoV-2 positive (5/19 [26&#x0025;] vs. 1/53 [2&#x0025;]; OR = 13.95; p = 0.004) phases (<bold>Figure S9F-G</bold>), but this analysis is limited by the total cohort sizes (n = 45 for pre-COVID comparison; n = 72 for SARS-CoV-2 positive comparison).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that laboratory-based diagnosis of AKI in the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis is not associated with post viral clearance hospitalization, while the diagnosis of stage 2&#x002B; AKI during the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase may be associated with subsequent hospitalization in male patients. However, the validity of this association must be further tested in larger patient cohorts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Almost one year after the first confirmed case, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage communities across the globe. While efforts early in the pandemic rightly focused on the acute lung inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2, the subsequent realization that COVID-19 may have more lasting effects has mandated a better understanding of factors that predispose patients to experience long-term COVID-19 related complications. We have previously sought to address this knowledge gap using state-of-the-art NLP models deployed on a massive EHR system, and here we have expanded this effort to include the longitudinal analysis of laboratory measurements both prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and during active SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p>It is first important to note that this study has several limitations. First, this analysis considers only patients within one EHR system; while this system does contain patient data from multiple sites of clinical care in distinct geographic locations (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida), there are still likely underlying biases in important factors such as patient demographics and tendencies around the ordering of laboratory tests by clinicians. Such biases could prevent the studied cohort and their associated data points from serving as true representative samples of all COVID-19 patients. Second, as was previously mentioned, the analyzed cohort was relatively small, with even smaller patient counts available for particular lab tests of interest. Finally, we defined a SARS-CoV-2 positive window based on the presence of two negative RT-PCR tests, but the likely true date of clearance would precede the first negative test by an unknown amount of time.</p>
<p>Consistent with our previous conclusions, this lab test analysis suggests that both anemia and renal function in the pre-COVID and SARS-CoV-2 positive phases are associated with the risk of post viral clearance hospitalization. While the pathophysiologic basis for these associations are not yet clear, the findings do merit consideration in the context of clinical care of COVID-19 patients. Indeed, pre-existing conditions are already integrated in the clinical decision-making algorithms around COVID-19 as the Center for Diseases Control (CDC) has designated various chronic conditions as risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection (e.g. cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease, obesity, and diabetes). However, there is much less known regarding factors or conditions that place people at risk for subsequent complications such as rehospitalization after viral clearance. Once identified, such factors and conditions should similarly be incorporated into the clinical decision-making process when treating COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Our finding that lower hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and the outright diagnosis of moderate or severe anemia, prior to or during active SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with post viral clearance hospitalization has not been previously reported. And while sickle cell disease is considered a risk factor for severe COVID-19, anemia itself is not considered to be such a risk factor. While we did not find evidence that administration of potential anemia-mitigating interventions was associated with lower risks of hospitalization after viral clearance, this does not rule out a role for anemia in long-term COVID-19 complications. It is important to note that we were not able to account for patient compliance in our analysis, and it is likely that patients who were moderately or severely anemic during their COVID-19 hospitalization were variably compliant with supplementation after their initial discharge. Further, even if mitigation of anemia does not impact subsequent hospitalization, these strong associations between anemia and COVID-19 are interesting in light of several previous lines of research.</p>
<p>First, several groups have reported an association between blood groups and susceptibility to and/or severity of COVID-19 infection ([<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], [<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], [<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]), suggesting that individuals with type O blood may be at lower risk for contracting COVID-19 or experiencing respiratory failure in the context of COVID-19. Whether this association reflects a direct or indirect interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and erythrocytes is not known, but it could certainly be relevant to pursue whether blood type is also associated with the occurrence or severity of anemia in the setting of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Second, fatigue has been commonly reported as both an acute symptom and a lasting effect of COVID-19 ([<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], [<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], [<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]), but the mechanisms underlying this phenotype have not been established. It is worth noting that 179 of the 229 (78&#x0025;) COVID-19 patients in this study had at least a mild anemia during their SARS-CoV-2 positive phase, and 103 of the 229 (45&#x0025;) patients had a moderate or severe anemia (defined as hemoglobin &#x003C; 11 g/dL) during this interval. It would be worthwhile to perform a longitudinal follow-up on these patients to determine whether they continue to experience anemia in the months following SARS-CoV-2 clearance, and whether the presence of such a post-COVID anemia is associated with reports of fatigue.</p>
<p>Our findings regarding renal function tests and acute kidney injury may also be of clinical interest. Indeed, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been recognized as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection. The fact that both median and extreme lab measurements suggest poorer renal function in the post clearance hospitalized cohort is consistent with this established risk factor, and suggests that the severity of one&#x2019;s CKD may have implications for their likelihood of hospitalization after viral clearance. Our finding that moderate/severe AKI during the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase was more frequently observed in the male PCH cohort compared to the male PCNH patients is interesting, but the small sample size available for analysis here would require further validation of this association.</p>
<p>Along with our previous analysis ([<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]), this study illustrates the value of deploying sophisticated platforms across EHR systems that enable the integrated analysis of diverse data types including sentiment-laden text and laboratory test measurements. Taken together, these studies provide the first example of leveraging augmented curation methods to first identify phenotypes that distinguish defined clinical cohorts and to then cross check these phenotypic associations through a hypothesis-driven analysis of the most relevant lab tests. This framework can be effectively scaled for other clinical research efforts not only in COVID-19 but also in any disease areas of interest.</p>

<sec id="s4a">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>This was a nested case-control study evaluating 93 post SARS-CoV-2 clearance hospitalized patients and 173 post SARS-CoV-2 clearance non-hospitalized patients, selected from a cohort of 22,223 patients who presented to the Mayo Clinic Health System (including tertiary medical centers in Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida) and received at least one positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test between the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and October 27, 2020 (see <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). This retrospective research was conducted with approval from the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB 20&#x2013;003278).</p>

<title>Selection of study participants</title>
<p>The definitions of the cases and controls were described in detail previously ([<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Briefly, post clearance hospitalized (&#x201C;PCH&#x201D;) cases (N=93) were defined as patients who had two documented negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests following their last positive test result and were subsequently admitted to the hospital within 90 days of clearance. Post clearance non-hospitalized (&#x201C;PCNH&#x201D;) controls (N=173) were defined as those who had two documented negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests following their last positive test result and were not hospitalized within 90 days of clearance. As shown in <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>, there were no statistically significant differences between these groups in age, relative cleared date (defined as time to second negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test after first positive test), race, and ethnicity. A majority of hospitalized post-clearance cases were female as compared to non-hospitalized controls (61.3&#x0025; vs. 41.0&#x0025;, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C;.01).</p>

<title>Definition of the considered time intervals: pre-COVID phase and SARS-CoV-2 positive phase</title>
<p>Laboratory results were assessed during the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, hitherto referred to as the pre-COVID-phase, and during the period in which SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive, hitherto referred to as the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase. A diagnosis of COVID-19 was conferred by a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and clearance was defined as two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests occurring after a positive test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c2">
<title>Selection and summarization of laboratory measurements</title>
<p>Our primary outcomes were anemia and AKI. Laboratory measurements related to anemia included hemoglobin and hematocrit, and laboratory measurements related to AKI included serum creatinine, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). For a given lab test, we considered the median, maximum, and minimum measurements for each patient during the specified time windows (i.e., one year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, and the PCR-defined SARS-CoV-2 positive phase). Given the directionality of these tests (i.e. anemia is defined by low hemoglobin and hematocrit, while kidney dysfunction is characterized by increases in serum creatinine and BUN but a decrease in eGFR), we were primarily interested in comparing the patient-level minimum values of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and eGFR, and maximum values of serum creatinine and BUN in each time period.</p>

<title>Classification of patients using clinical diagnostic criteria for anemia and AKI</title>

<title>Classification of patients based on administration of potential anemia mitigating interventions</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of anemia-targeted interventions in the year prior to or during COVID-19 infection, we identified patients from this cohort who received (1) blood transfusions per medical procedure documentation and/or (2) one or more of the following therapies per medication administration records: oral or intravenous iron, multivitamin or prenatal vitamins containing iron, oral or intramuscular vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), and intravenous or subcutaneous darbepoetin or erythropoietin.</p>

<title>Quantification of number of blood draws per patient</title>
<p>To test whether trends in anemia-related measurements could be explained by differences in the number of blood draws received in the pre-COVID or SARS-CoV-2 positive phases, we counted the number of blood draws in these time intervals for each patient. All tests with a documented source of &#x201C;Blood&#x201D;, &#x201C;Plasma&#x201D;, or &#x201C;Serum&#x201D; were collected for each patient; for a given patient on a given day, we then took the count of the most frequently obtained test as the number of blood draws for that patient on that day. For example, if the record for Patient <italic>P</italic> on Day <italic>D</italic> contained 5 serum sodium measurements, 3 hemoglobin measurements, and 1 plasma IL-6 measurement, then we inferred that Patient <italic>P</italic> received 5 blood draws on Day <italic>D</italic>.</p>
