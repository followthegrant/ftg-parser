<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Governments have implemented a range of measure to tackle COVID-19, primarily focusing on changing citizens&#x2019; behaviours in order to lower transmission of the virus. Some policymakers have expressed concern that citizens would not maintain high levels of compliance with these behaviours over the pandemic and would instead exhibit so-called &#x201C;behavioural fatigue&#x201D;. While the concept has been criticized, there have been few tests of behavioural fatigue using data from the COVID-19 pandemic, and none that have tracked individuals&#x2019; compliance trajectories</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We used longitudinal data on self-reported compliance from 50,851 adults in the COVID-19 Social Study collected across two waves of the pandemic in the UK (01 April 2020 &#x2013; 22 February 2021). We modelled typical compliance trajectories using latent growth curve analysis (LGCA) and tested for behavioural fatigue by attempting to identify a set of participants whose compliance decreased substantially over the study period.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We selected a four-class LGCA solution. Most individuals maintained high levels of compliance over the pandemic and reported similar levels of compliance across the first and second waves. Approximately one in seven participants had decreasing levels of compliance across the pandemic, reporting noticeably lower levels of compliance in the second wave, a pattern compatible with behavioural fatigue. Individuals with declining compliance levels differed from those with consistently high compliance on multiple characteristics, including (young) age, better physical health, lower empathy and conscientiousness and greater general willingness to take risks.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While a minority, not all individuals have maintained high compliance across the pandemic. Decreasing compliance is related to several psychological traits. The results suggest that targeting of behaviour change messages later in the pandemic may be needed to increase compliance.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prior to the full roll-out of a vaccine, government strategies to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have focused on changing citizens&#x2019; behaviours, for instance via advertising personal hygiene reminders (e.g., washing hands), mandating the wearing of face masks, recommending social distancing in public spaces, and prohibiting household mixing. Where followed, these interventions can reduce the spread of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chu et al., 2020</xref>). However, each require voluntary cooperation on behalf of citizens, sometimes at considerable personal cost. Compliance with these behaviours is high but not complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ipsos MORI, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">YouGov, 2021</xref>). International data shows that average levels of compliance have declined since the start of the pandemic, though compliance has increased somewhat as countries have experienced second waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">YouGov, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Petherick et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>While population-level trends have been mapped, these trends could mask considerable heterogeneity: some individuals may have maintained high levels of compliance, while others may have stopped. Existing evidence from the current and previous pandemics shows that trends in compliance can differ markedly across groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">J&#x00F8;rgensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Petherick et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">van der Weerd et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wright &#x0026; Fancourt, 2020</xref>). For instance, in the UK, compliance decreased faster among younger age groups over the first five months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wright &#x0026; Fancourt, 2020</xref>). Yet, to our knowledge, no research has been carried out looking at individual compliance trajectories across the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a striking gap given that variation in infectiousness can influence how viruses spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bansal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005</xref>) and that examining individual compliance trajectories could support the targeting and design of interventions for behaviour change.</p>
<p>Modelling compliance trajectories is also important for understanding the extent to which individuals have suffered &#x201C;behavioural fatigue&#x201D;, understood here as a loss of motivation to comply as pandemic progress, holding other things (such as background risk of infection) constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Petherick et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2020</xref>). At the beginning of the pandemic, lead UK Government scientists cited behavioural fatigue as a reason to delay the imposition of strict lockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mahase, 2020</xref>). The concept was widely criticised as being poorly elucidated and lacking scientific basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbasi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Drury et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hahn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Michie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Reicher &#x0026; Drury, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sibony, 2020</xref>). Indeed, there continues to be disagreement on how behavioural fatigue should be defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Harvey, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lilleholt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Michie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Petherick et al., 2021</xref>), and related phrases have entered also usage, notably &#x201C;pandemic fatigue&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Petherick et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these criticisms &#x2013; and the apparent importance of the idea in influencing policy &#x2013; empirical testing of behavioural fatigue has been limited. Recent work has studied declines in population-level compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Petherick et al., 2021</xref>), focused on between-person differences in compliance motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lilleholt et al., 2020</xref>), or assessed the role of related factors, such as boredom, in predicting compliance behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Martarelli &#x0026; Wolff, 2020</xref>). While informative, these approaches do not evaluate changes in compliance at the level of the individual, a process central to the notion of fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Harvey, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Michie et al., 2020</xref>). Studying average compliance levels offers only a blunt test of behavioural fatigue as averages may mask significant heterogeneity.</p>
<p>In this study, we used (unbalanced) panel data from 50,000 adults from across two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK (April 2020 &#x2013; February 2021) to model individual trajectories of (self-reported) compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. We used latent class growth analysis to identify &#x201C;typical&#x201D; compliance trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Herle et al., 2020</xref>), examined whether these were compatible with behavioural fatigue, and tested how compliance trajectories were related to a variety of demographic, personality trait and individual risk factors. Our test of behavioural fatigue was whether we could identify a sizeable proportion of participants whose compliance decreased substantially over the study period. Note, while such a pattern is compatible with behavioural fatigue, it is not conclusive evidence thereof: though death rates were greater at the height of the second wave and similar lockdown measure were been put in place, many relevant factors relevant to compliance changed, including understanding of rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Denford et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Williams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Williams &#x0026; Dienes, 2021</xref>), information seeking (though this may be a consequence of fatigue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lilleholt et al., 2020</xref>), and scientific knowledge of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the study represents the first test of the consequences of behavioural fatigue at an individual level.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We used data from the COVID-19 Social Study; a large panel study of the psychological and social experiences of over 70,000 adults (aged 18&#x002B;) in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study commenced on 21 March 2020 and involved online weekly (from August 2020, monthly) data collection across the pandemic in the UK. The study is not random and therefore is not representative of the UK population, but it does contain a heterogeneous sample. The sample was recruited using three primary approaches. First, convenience sampling was used, including promoting the study through existing networks and mailing lists (including large databases of adults who had previously consented to be involved in health research across the UK), print and digital media coverage, and social media. Second, more targeted recruitment was undertaken focusing on (i) individuals from a low-income background, (ii) individuals with no or few educational qualifications, and (iii) individuals who were unemployed. Third, the study was promoted via partnerships with third sector organisations to vulnerable groups, including adults with pre-existing mental health conditions, older adults, carers, and people experiencing domestic violence or abuse. The study was approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee [12467/005] and all participants gave informed consent. The study protocol and user guide (which includes full details on recruitment, retention, data cleaning, weighting and sample demographics) are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/UCL-BSH/CSSUserGuide">https://github.com/UCL-BSH/CSSUserGuide</ext-link>.</p>
<p>For these analyses, we used data from the eleven months between 01 April 2020 to 22 February 2021. To model non-linear changes in compliance trajectories we focused on individuals with compliance data from three or more data collections across the study period (n = 50,851). This sample represents 71.2&#x0025; of those with data collection by 22 February 2021. Lockdown measures were first announced in the UK on 23 March 2020. The study period overlaps with two waves of COVID-19. Government guidelines and the severity of lockdown measures changed frequently across the study period. Supplementary Figure S1 shows 7-day COVID-19 caseloads and confirmed deaths, along with the Oxford Policy Tracker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hale et al., 2020</xref>), a numerical summary of policy stringency, over the study period.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Compliance with COVID-19 Guidelines</title>
<p>Compliance with guidelines was measured at each data collection using a single-item measure: &#x201C;Are you following the recommendations from authorities to prevent spread of Covid-19?&#x201D;. The item was measured on a seven-point Likert scale (1 = &#x201C;Not at all&#x201D;, 7 = &#x201C;Very much so&#x201D;), and analysed as a continuous variable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b2">
<title>Predictors of Compliance</title>
<p>We assess the role of several predictors of compliance. We included variables for demographic and socio-economic characteristics, social and pro-social factors, physical and mental health, and personality traits. We selected these variables using the COM-B framework of health behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Michie et al., 2011</xref>). The COM-B model posits that behaviour is determined by subjective and objective capability, opportunity for action, and autonomic and reflective motivation.</p>
<p>For capability to comply, we included variables for locus of control, resilience, neighbourhood crowding, annual household income, educational level, diagnosed psychiatric condition, ethnicity and the Big-5 personality trait conscientiousness. For opportunity to comply, we included variables for country of residence, employment status, neighbourhood crowding, and availability of neighbourhood space. For motivation to comply, we include variables for long-term physical health conditions (0, 1, 2&#x002B;), age (grouped), sex, self-isolation during first the first wave, remaining Big-5 personality traits (openness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism), (cognitive and emotional) empathy, neighbourhood social capital, attachment to neighbourhood, neighbourhood satisfaction, risk-taking behaviour, household overcrowding (1&#x002B; persons per room), living arrangement (alone, not alone without child, not alone with child), and mental health experiences during the first lockdown (same, better or worse vis-&#x00E0;-vis prior to the pandemic). Several of these variables were measured in one-off modules during follow-up and so are missing for many individuals. More detail on the individual measures is provided in the Supplementary Information. These variables have been studied previously in analyses of the COVID-19 Social Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wright, Steptoe, et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wright &#x0026; Fancourt, 2020</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Our analysis proceeded in three steps. First, we estimated a growth curve model to examine between-person variation in compliance trajectories. To allow for compliance to change non-linearly with time, we modelled growth curves using natural splines (three degrees of freedom) and included random intercepts and random slopes in this model. Second, we used used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify &#x201C;typical&#x201D; compliance trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Herle et al., 2020</xref>), again using natural splines to allow for flexible relationships with time. We repeated LCGA models for 2-7 classes, using a thresholds link function to account for the non-normality of our compliance measure. We selected the final model considering the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) and entropy values, average latent class probabilities and substantive interpretation of the classes identified. To reduce the risk of the algorithm identifying a local maximum, we fit models with 100 random starts (30 iterations each).</p>
<p>Third, we used multinomial logistic regression to identify predictors of class membership. For each variable, we first estimated a bivariate model and then estimated a multivariate model that included adjustment for sex, country, shielding, psychiatric diagnoses and long-term conditions, household overcrowding, living arrangement, income, (baseline) employment status, ethnic group, education, age group, and Big-5 personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Soto &#x0026; John, 2017</xref>). To account for uncertainty in the LCGA classes, we estimated multinomial regressions using &#x201C;pseudo&#x201D; draws from posterior probability matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nylund-Gibson et al., 2019</xref>). We combined this procedure with multiple imputation (m = 60) to account for item missingness, pooling estimates using Rubin&#x2019;s Rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rubin, 1987</xref>). We used unweighted data to estimate growth curve and LCGA models but added weights in multinomial models. The weights were created using entropy balancing according to population proportions for age, gender, ethnicity, education, and country of living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nomis, 2018</xref>). The data used to create these weights was missing for 357 participants, so the sample is slightly smaller (0.7&#x0025;) for the multinomial logit models (n = 50,494).</p>
<p>Data analysis was carried out in R v 4.0.3. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">R Core Team, 2020</xref>). The growth curve model was estimated using the lme4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bates et al., 2015</xref>), LCGA models were estimated using the lcmm package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Proust-Lima et al., 2017</xref>), multinomial regression was carried out the nnet package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Venables et al., 2002</xref>), and imputed data was generated using the mice package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">van Buuren &#x0026; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011</xref>). Due to stipulations set out by the ethics committee, data will be made available at the end of the pandemic.

Table S1 shows descriptive statistics by last month of (continuous) follow-up or whether the participant was ineligible for inclusion for the study. There is evidence of differences in attrition rates across groups. Notably older individuals were more likely to remain in the study. Figure S2 shows trends in compliance by last month of follow-up. Those with higher compliance levels were more likely to remain in the study, but there were qualitatively similar trends in compliance across groups: average compliance decreased from the first lockdown to early Autumn before increasing as the UK faced its second wave.</p>

Figure S3 plots predicted compliance trends for a subsample of 6,000 participants in the study. The qualitative trends of declining and then increasing compliance levels is displayed among most individuals but is pronounced among a set of individuals whose compliance decreases substantially. Among those who compliance declined the most, there was less pronounced increases in compliance during the second wave. For individuals whose compliance decreased to a lesser extent, compliance returned to broadly similar levels as reported in the first levels. The plots demonstrate that population-level trends mask substantial heterogeneity.</p>

<title>Compliance Trajectory Classes</title>
<p>Fit statistics from the LGTA models are displayed in Figure S4. We selected a 4-class solution (entropy = 0.82) as solutions with a higher number of classes yielded substantively similar groups. <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> displays class proportions and average class probabilities. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> displays predicted compliance trends in each group. Results are alternatively displayed as predicted probabilities in Figure S5 and as a sample of growth curves modelled in the previous section in Figure S6. The largest group (Class 1; 32.8&#x0025; of weighted observations) consisted of individuals whose compliance remained high throughout the pandemic. Classes 2 and 3 (28.7&#x0025; and 24&#x0025;, respectively) consisted of individuals whose compliance began high before dropping across summer and increasing to approximately its former levels during the second wave. Class 4 (14.6&#x0025;), on the other hand, consisted of individuals whose compliance decreased sharply over the first lockdown and, while rising during the second wave, did not reach its former levels. This pattern is consistent with behavioural fatigue, though it should be noted predicted levels of compliance during February 2020 were still predicted to be approximately 5 on a 1-7 scale.</p>

<p>Also related to behavioural fatigue were (low) resilience, internal locus of control, gender (male), low attachment or satisfaction with neighbourhood, and trait (low) neuroticism, (low) agreeableness, extraversion and openness to experience. Notably, associations between neighbourhood crowding, household overcrowding, or available space and compliance were small, and, relative to stable mental health, both improving <italic>and</italic> worsening mental health during first lockdown were related to lower compliance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using self-report data on compliance with COVID-19 guidelines from eleven month of the pandemic, we found evidence of substantial heterogeneity in compliance trajectories. While average compliance levels decreased only slightly from the first lockdown to mid-Autumn and returned to similar levels during the second wave in Winter 2020/2021, a minority of individuals for whom compliance decreased more substantially and did not fully recover, while the modal response was consistent high compliance levels. The results were consistent with at least some individuals experiencing behavioural fatigue. We identified several predictors of compliance trajectories. Notably, the behavioural fatigue pattern was related to age, (baseline) employment status, better physical health, and traits such as risk-taking behaviour, low empathy, low conscientiousness, disagreeableness, and low resilience.</p>
<p>The results are consistent with previous work on behavioural fatigue showing declines in average compliance across the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Petherick et al., 2021</xref>), though add richness in showing that it is only a minority of individuals for whom compliance decreases. The results suggest that low and decreasing compliance partly reflects risk (proxied by age and physical health) and personality traits. Some authors have argued that low compliance is largely a matter of material difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Reicher &#x0026; Drury, 2021</xref>), but this is not consistent with results here nor is it consistent with other studies that have identified several traits &#x2013; including anti-social dark triad traits &#x2013; as predictors of compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blagov, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Nowak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zajenkowski et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>While the results are compatible with behaviour fatigue, they are not dispositive. An issue is that several factors have changed across the pandemic that may also explain results. One alternative explanation for reduced compliance is &#x201C;alert fatigue&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Williams &#x0026; Dienes, 2021</xref>). Qualitative studies report that individuals have found it difficult to follow frequently-changing government rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Denford et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Williams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wright, Burton, et al., 2021</xref>), leading to inadvertent non-compliance as well as bending of rules. However, during national lockdown in early 2021, rules were simplified and made largely uniform. Further, it is difficult to understand the role of traits, such as risk-taking, in predicting decreasing compliance in interpreting the results as alert fatigue. Other explanations are also possible, notably changes in perceptions of risk. While we are unable to assess this directly, we note that death rates were higher in the second wave (Figure S1). However, subjective risk perception may have reduced regardless, particularly for individuals who believed they had had the virus already. Disentangling changes in risk perception from behavioural fatigue is complicated by the possibility that reduced information seeking may be a consequence of fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lilleholt et al., 2020</xref>) and that individuals could employ motivated reasoning when willingness to comply has fallen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rothgerber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sembada &#x0026; Kalantari, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Shefrin, 2020</xref>). Regardless of the underlying cause, our results show heterogeneity in the level and trajectory of compliance behaviour. This has implications for transmission modelling, and for the targeting or design of interventions at those who have lowest compliance.</p>
<p>While we find that average compliance declined, it should be reiterated that sustained declines were a minority response. The majority of individuals reported high levels of compliance throughout the pandemic and reported similar levels of compliance in the first and second waves. However, three caveats should be noted. First, we used data from a convenience sample of individuals willing to participate &#x2013; and continue participating in &#x2013; a study expressly about COVID-19. These individuals are likely to comply with COVID-19 guidelines more than the wider population, so the extent of non-compliance may be underestimated in this study. Second, we modelled compliance as changing continuously through time, but individuals could violate guidelines intermittently to combat fatigue (for instance, occasionally meeting friends). Designs such as qualitative interviewing could be used to assess this possibility. Third, while our measure of compliance was framed in the present tense, it is possible that previous behaviour could influence responses, restricting temporal change. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with other research that has focused on specific behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Petherick et al., 2021</xref>)</p>
<p>There were other limitations of our study. We used self-report compliance data, which is likely to be subject to issues of social desirability and recall bias. Some of the associations observed in the multinomial logistic regression modelling may be explained by non-differential measurement error. Attrition from the study meant that extrapolations further into the pandemic were made for many participants. Though, as noted, we suspect this means our estimates of non-compliance are conservative. Finally, we were unable to provide a conclusive test of behavioural fatigue. Innovative designs are required to separate fatigue from other alternative explanations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this study also had a number of strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating individual compliance trajectories. The results in this study may have implications for the modelling of the transmission of the virus, as well as raising questions for the targeting and design of behaviour change interventions. This study adds to a small literature examining compliance across the current and previous pandemics, showing variations in behaviour across time and between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ayre et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cowling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Folmer, Brownlee, et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Folmer, Kuiper, et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">J&#x00F8;rgensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Petherick et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">van der Weerd et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wright &#x0026; Fancourt, 2020</xref>).</p>
