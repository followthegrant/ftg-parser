<meta name="DC.Description" content="Adopting plant-based diets high in fiber may reduce global warming and obesity prevalence. Physiological and psychological determinants of plant-based food decision-making remain unclear, particularly in real-life settings. As fiber has been linked with improved gut-brain signaling, we hypothesized that a single plant-based compared to an animal-based meal, would induce higher satiety, higher mood and less stress.

In three smartphone-based studies adults (nall = 16,379) ranked satiety and mood on 5/10-point Likert scales before and after meal intake. Statistical analyses comprised linear mixed models, extended by nutrient composition, taste ratings, gender, social interaction, type of decision and dietary adherence to consider potential confounding.

Overall, meal intake induced satiety and higher mood. Against our hypotheses, plant-based meal choice did not explain differences in hunger after the meal. Considering mood, individuals choosing a plant-based meal reported slightly higher mood before the meal and smaller mood increases after the meal compared to those choosing animal-based meals (post-meal*plant-based: b = -0.06, t = -3.6, model comparison p &lt; .001). Protein content marginally mediated post-meal satiety, while gender and taste ratings had a strong effect on satiety and mood in general.

In this series of large-scale online studies, we could not detect profound effects of plant-based vs. animal-based meals on satiety and mood. Instead of meal category, satiety and mood depended on taste and protein content of the meal, as well as dietary habits and gender. Our findings might help to develop strategies to increase acceptability of healthy and sustainable plant-based food choices.

Significance Statement Despite increasing awareness of plant-based diets as lifestyle- and climate-friendly option, the effects of plant-based meals on physiology and psychology remain largely understudied. Real-world large-scale studies looking at differential effects of plant-based vs. animal-based meals are missing. Yet, investigating the effects of meal category will help to understand underlying decision-making strategies and inform governmental policies and individual meal choices. In three large-scale online studies set in a real-world environment with over 16,000 datapoints, we showed that meal category had minor impact only on post-meal satiety and mood ratings compared to timepoint and demographic factors. We propose that our findings should be considered when designing cafeteria menus, by increasing taste and protein content, in particular of plant-based meals, in (university) cafeterias.

Overall, meal intake induced satiety and higher mood. Against our hypotheses, plant-based meal choice did not explain differences in hunger after the meal. Considering mood, individuals choosing a plant-based meal reported slightly higher mood before the meal and smaller mood increases after the meal compared to those choosing animal-based meals (post-meal*plant-based: b = -0.06, t = -3.6, model comparison p &lt; .001). Protein content marginally mediated post-meal satiety, while gender and taste ratings had a strong effect on satiety and mood in general.

In this series of large-scale online studies, we could not detect profound effects of plant-based vs. animal-based meals on satiety and mood. Instead of meal category, satiety and mood depended on taste and protein content of the meal, as well as dietary habits and gender. Our findings might help to develop strategies to increase acceptability of healthy and sustainable plant-based food choices.

Significance Statement Despite increasing awareness of plant-based diets as lifestyle- and climate-friendly option, the effects of plant-based meals on physiology and psychology remain largely understudied. Real-world large-scale studies looking at differential effects of plant-based vs. animal-based meals are missing. Yet, investigating the effects of meal category will help to understand underlying decision-making strategies and inform governmental policies and individual meal choices. In three large-scale online studies set in a real-world environment with over 16,000 datapoints, we showed that meal category had minor impact only on post-meal satiety and mood ratings compared to timepoint and demographic factors. We propose that our findings should be considered when designing cafeteria menus, by increasing taste and protein content, in particular of plant-based meals, in (university) cafeterias.

<meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="Adopting plant-based diets high in fiber may reduce global warming and obesity prevalence. Physiological and psychological determinants of plant-based food decision-making remain unclear, particularly in real-life settings. As fiber has been linked with improved gut-brain signaling, we hypothesized that a single plant-based compared to an animal-based meal, would induce higher satiety, higher mood and less stress.

Physiological and psychological determinants of plant-based food decision-making remain unclear, particularly in real-life settings. As fiber has been linked with improved gut-brain signaling, we hypothesized that a single plant-based compared to an animal-based meal, would induce higher satiety, higher mood and less stress.</p><p id="p-3">In three smartphone-based studies adults (n<sub>all</sub> = 16,379) ranked satiety and mood on 5/10-point Likert scales before and after meal intake. Statistical analyses comprised linear mixed models, extended by nutrient composition, taste ratings, gender, social interaction, type of decision and dietary adherence to consider potential confounding.</p><p id="p-4">Overall, meal intake induced satiety and higher mood. Against our hypotheses, plant-based meal choice did not explain differences in hunger after the meal. Considering mood, individuals choosing a plant-based meal reported slightly higher mood before the meal and smaller mood increases after the meal compared to those choosing animal-based meals (post-meal*plant-based: b = -0.06, t = -3.6, model comparison p &lt; .001). Protein content marginally mediated post-meal satiety, while gender and taste ratings had a strong effect on satiety and mood in general.</p><p id="p-5">In this series of large-scale online studies, we could not detect profound effects of plant-based vs. animal-based meals on satiety and mood. Instead of meal category, satiety and mood depended on taste and protein content of the meal, as well as dietary habits and gender. Our findings might help to develop strategies to increase acceptability of healthy and sustainable plant-based food choices.</p><div id="sec-1" class="subsection"><p id="p-6"><strong>Significance Statement</strong> Despite increasing awareness of plant-based diets as lifestyle- and climate-friendly option, the effects of plant-based meals on physiology and psychology remain largely understudied. Real-world large-scale studies looking at differential effects of plant-based vs. animal-based meals are missing. Yet, investigating the effects of meal category will help to understand underlying decision-making strategies and inform governmental policies and individual meal choices. In three large-scale online studies set in a real-world environment with over 16,000 datapoints, we showed that meal category had minor impact only on post-meal satiety and mood ratings compared to timepoint and demographic factors. We propose that our findings should be considered when designing cafeteria menus, by increasing taste and protein content, in particular of plant-based meals, in (university) cafeterias.</p></div></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-7">The authors have declared no competing interest.</p><h3>Funding Statement</h3><p id="p-8">Funding was provided by the Max Planck Society and a promotion stipend by the German Federal Environmental Foundation (EM).</p><h3>Author Declarations</h3><p id="p-9">I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.</p><p id="p-10">Yes</p><p id="p-11">The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:</p><p id="p-12">The Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Leipzig approved the study protocol and all participants provided written informed consent.
