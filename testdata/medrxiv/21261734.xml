<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>In Bogot&#x00E1; by August 1st, more than 27,000 COVID-19 deaths have been reported, while complete and partial vaccination coverage reached 30% and 37%, respectively. Although reported cases are decreasing, the potential impact of new variants is uncertain.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We used an agent-based model of COVID-19 calibrated to local data. Variants and vaccination strategies were included. We estimated the impact of vaccination and modelled scenarios of early and delayed introduction of the delta variant, along with changes in mobility, social contact, and vaccine uptake over the next months.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Findings</title>
<p>By mid-July, vaccination may have prevented 17,800 (95% CrI: 16,000 - 19,000) deaths in Bogot&#x00E1;. We found that delta could lead to a fourth wave of magnitude and timing dependent on social mixing, vaccination strategy, and delta dominance. In scenarios of early dominance of delta by mid-July, age prioritization and maintaining the interval between doses were important factors to avert deaths. However, if delta dominance occurred after mid-September, age prioritization would be less relevant, and the magnitude of a four wave would be smaller. In all scenarios, higher social mixing increased the magnitude of the fourth wave. Increasing vaccination rates from 50,000/day to 100,000/day reduced the impact of a fourth wave due to delta.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>The magnitude and timing of a potential fourth wave in Bogot&#x00E1; caused by delta would depend on social mixing and the timing of dominance. Rapidly increasing vaccination coverage with non-delayed second doses could reduce the burden of a new wave.</p></sec>

<title>Research in Context</title>
<sec>
<title>Evidence before this study</title>
<p>The impact of vaccination strategies in the context of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and increasing social mixing in Colombia had not been previously evaluated through mathematical modelling. We searched PubMed for modelling studies using the terms &#x201C;COVID-19 vaccine AND model AND variant AND Colombia&#x201D; or &#x201C;SARS-CoV-2 AND vaccine AND model AND variant AND Colombia&#x201D; (From 2021/1/1 to 2021/07/31). We did not find studies addressing this question. However, we found a model describing the evolution of the epidemic in the country during the first year, and research on the emergence of alpha, gamma, and B.1.621 variants in Colombia. We extended a previous version of our SARS-CoV-2 agent-based model for Bogot&#x00E1; to include the potential effect of vaccination and variants. This model simulates transmission of SARS-CoV-2 based on daily activity patterns of a synthetic population, representing demographic and geographic characteristics of the total population of the city.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Added value of this study</title>
<p>First, our study provides a preliminary estimate of the impact of the vaccination program in Bogot&#x00E1; in terms of the number of deaths prevented. The second major finding is the indication that due to the introduction of the delta variant in the city, and based on the current knowledge of its biology, there is a risk of a fourth epidemic wave, whose time of occurrence and magnitude would depend mainly on three factors: when delta becomes dominant, the intensity of social contact, and vaccination roll-out strategy and coverage.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
<p>We estimate that by mid-July, vaccination may have already prevented 17,800 (95% CrI: 16,000 - 19,000) deaths in Bogot&#x00E1;. The delta variant could become dominant and lead to a fourth wave later in the year, but its timing will depend on the date of introduction, social mixing patterns, and vaccination strategy. In all scenarios, higher social mixing is associated with a fourth wave of considerable magnitude. If an early delta introduction occurred (dominance by mid-July), a new wave may occur in August/September and in such case, age prioritization of vaccination and maintaining the 21-day interval between doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 are more important. However, if introduction occurred one or two months later (with dominance by mid-August/September) a fourth wave would be of smaller magnitude, the age-prioritization is less relevant, but maintaining the dose scheme without postponement is more important. In all scenarios we found that increasing the vaccination rate from the current average of 50,000/day to 100,000/day reduces the impact of a potential fourth wave due to the delta variant. Our study indicates that given the possibility of a fourth wave in the city, it is necessary to continue maintaining adherence to non-pharmacological interventions, such as the use of face masks and physical distancing, to be cautious with the intensification of social activities, and that it is essential to increase the current pace of vaccinations to rapidly reach high vaccination coverage in the population of the city.</p></sec></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In Colombia, by the beginning of August 2021, 4.8 million COVID-19 cases and 122,000 deaths due to COVID-19 had been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Bogot&#x00E1; contributes to close to 30% of the cases in the country, with 1.4 million reported by the first week of August [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The third wave of the epidemic in the country surpassed the magnitude of the previous two, and overwhelmed the capacity of the health system.</p>
<p>Vaccination against COVID-19 initiated in the country on February 17, 2021 with various vaccines introduced progressively (CoronaVac/Sinovac, Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZD1222), Janssen (J&#x0026;J) Ad26.COV2.S, and more recently Moderna (mRNA-1273). The Ministry of Health defined a prioritization strategy that started with health care workers, and then in the general population beginning with the older age groups and those with comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. By the beginning of August, 32% of the total population of Colombia had received at least one dose, and about 25% had a complete scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. In Bogot&#x00E1;, 5.3 million doses had been administered, with 38% of the population having received at least one dose, and close to 30% a completed vaccination scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Under the age-prioritization strategy, the country has started to vaccinate those above 25 years[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Various SARS-CoV-2 variants have been reported in Colombia. The alpha variant (B.1.1.7) was first reported on April 16, 2021, and the gamma variant (P.1) on January 29, 2021. In addition, several regions in Colombia have reported since the beginning of January the B.1.621 variant, which then became dominant during the third wave of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The delta variant (B.1.617.2) was reported on July 24, 2021. This variant of concern (VOC) has overtaken as dominant in various countries in Latin America such as Brazil, Mexico, and Costa Rica [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Delta has been described in the United Kingdom as 1.5 times more transmissible than alpha, with increased severity, and reducing the effectiveness of vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Given the characteristics of delta, it is important to quantify its potential impact if it becomes the dominant variant in Bogot&#x00E1;.</p>
<p>We used a detailed agent-based model of the epidemic in Bogot&#x00E1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] to explore the impact of multiple circulating variants, including delta. We also studied the impact of changing social mixing patterns in the city and of different vaccination strategies.</p>

<title>Model calibration until third wave</title>
<p>The model was calibrated to daily reported deaths and seroprevalence data in Bogot&#x00E1;. Using preliminary data on variants dominance in the city, observed mobility, and vaccination coverage, we reproduced the daily trends of deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number and daily demand of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the city (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4</xref>). Although the third wave has been the largest in the city, and the model shows an attack rate over 80% in the city by July, our simulations show that the vaccination program already had a large impact on the peak and total number of deaths. Up to mid-July 2021, we estimate a total of 17,800 (95% CrI: 16,000 - 19,000) deaths averted by vaccination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The model results suggest that the third wave of infections was caused mainly by the B.1.621 followed by the gamma variant (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3</xref>). We estimated that the B.1.621 variant is likely to be 1.2 (1.2 -1.98) times more transmissible and able to evade immunity from previous infections at 37% (19% - 48%), compared to the original lineage. We estimated the potential early introduction of the alpha variant in Bogot&#x00E1; to be around November 2020, followed by the introduction of gamma early in January, 2021 (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>), whereas the appearance of B.1.621 may have occurred later in the month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Based on this framework, our baseline scenario assumed that importations from the delta variant may have started in Bogot&#x00E1; since May 2021 (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>), but in such a case, delta would not become dominant before August (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3</xref>). Calibrated parameters are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">Table S3</xref>.</p>

<title>Model future projections</title>
<p>The baseline model assumes that the delta variant has already been introduced in the city but it is not yet dominant. Projections show a fourth wave of COVID-19 in the city due to the delta variant, however, its magnitude would depend on the date of introduction of delta, the social mixing patterns, and the vaccination coverage achieved at the time of dominance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="21261734v2_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Our model results show that the magnitude of a fourth wave of COVID-19 in Bogot&#x00E1; would depend on the intensity of social mixing over the coming months. The current level of social mixing assumes a moderate-high level of mobility with a moderate level of contacts, while the scenario of higher social mixing assumes an increase in the number of contacts per person, in the community overall, in addition to high levels of mobility. In all scenarios, higher social mixing increased the projected number of deaths and ICU demand in the context of a dominant delta variant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). With high social mixing, an early introduction of delta would result in a peak of 189 (95% CrI: 160-245) daily deaths, whereas a late introduction would cause a peak of 130 (95% CrI: 116 - 180). In both scenarios of the introduction of delta, reduced social mixing resulted in a smaller peak. With moderate social mixing, an early introduction of delta would result in a peak of 104 (95% CrI: 77-150) daily deaths, compared to 59 (95% CrI: 47-136) daily deaths in the scenario of late introduction of delta.</p>
<p>Another determinant of the potential magnitude of the fourth wave is the vaccination coverage achieved by the time delta is dominant. In scenarios of an early introduction of delta (dominance in August), our simulations showed that a new wave may occur in August/September, and in such case, changes in the vaccination strategies would have a small effect in the dynamics of the fourth wave. Nonetheless, increasing the vaccination rate to 100,000 vaccines/day could slightly reduce the impact on deaths and ICU demand if age continues to be prioritized and the interval between doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 is not extended to 84 days. Extending the dose interval to 84 days resulted in an increased number of infections and deaths in this scenario, even with higher vaccination rates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> &#x0026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">S5</xref>, left column). In the scenario in which delta introduction occurs two months later (dominance in October), the age-prioritization for adults is less relevant but maintaining the dose scheme without postponement is more important, given that those with only one vaccine dose have lower protection against infection, particularly for delta (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>), which resulted in an increased number of infections and deaths at the population level (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figs S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7</xref>). In the scenario of dominance of delta in October, we found that increasing the vaccination rate to 100,000/day (the maximum possible according to health authorities) could have a larger impact in reducing the burden of a fourth wave due to the delta variant. These findings are more pronounced if assuming that efficacy against infection is 100% of the efficacy against symptoms (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figs S8</xref> &#x0026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">S9</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We simulated the impact of the introduction of the delta variant using an agent-based model that includes a detailed representation of the population of Bogot&#x00E1; by age, geographic location, and main social activities and mobility patterns (schools, universities, workplaces, long-term care facilities, households, and neighborhoods). This model has been previously validated to COVID-19 dynamics in various places [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. We found that the increased number of cases and deaths during the third wave of COVID-19 in the city could be explained by a combination of higher mobility and social contacts, along with the presence of variants of concern or interest in particular gamma may explain the first part of the third wave, whereas B.1.621 the second part. B.1.621 may have overcome the gamma variant as dominant despite being potentially introduced at similar times. Interestingly, we found that the alpha variant was not a driver of the third wave. Our model suggests that despite an estimated high infection attack rate in the city, that there is still a risk of an additional fourth wave produced by the delta variant, whose amplitude would depend on the timing of dominance of delta, the vaccination coverage and strategy, and the level of social mixing over the next months.</p>
<p>We evaluated the potential impact of postponing the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine on the potential future dynamics of COVID-19 in the city given delta dominance. We found that in our context this may not contribute to reducing the impact of a fourth wave, in contrast to previous modeling analyses that have shown benefits at the population level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. However, those studies have been evaluated for non-delta variants. Also, the benefits of second dose postponement is still under debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Some studies have suggested that postponing the second dose may be related with stronger and more durable immune protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. However, even if this holds, postponement of the second dose would result in less protection against infection and disease at the individual level for those with an incomplete vaccination scheme under the imminence of the presence of delta variant, which may result in a higher number of infections, and consequently deaths, at the population level. Indeed, recent studies indicate that the effectiveness of the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and the Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZD1222) vaccines considerably decreases for the delta variant (36% and 30%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>We also evaluated the impact of different vaccination roll-out strategies. We found that even if vaccination rates are doubled, under a scenario of early introduction of delta, there might not be enough time to mitigate the impact of a fourth wave. However, if the introduction of delta is delayed or social mixing remains moderate, increasing the vaccination rates may result in a milder fourth wave. Our results suggest that in the context of a delayed presence of delta, a preferred strategy for the city is maintaining moderate levels of social mixing combined with a rapid increase in vaccination rates (even without age prioritization) and administering the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine without postponement.</p>
<p>Based on data available on vaccination coverage and vaccine hesitancy for adults being estimated in population-based surveys at 12,8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], we assumed that about 10% of the target population remains not vaccinated, despite already being eligible. This means that for each target group defined by the vaccination campaign roll-out plan there is a remaining high-risk population that has not been vaccinated (due to hesitancy or access barriers). Although we did not model strategies to reach these populations, vaccinating these groups will have the highest impact in reducing severe disease outcomes in a future wave of COVID-19.</p>

<title>Limitations and strengths</title>
<p>Our model relies on data to adjust current dynamics and to project hypothetical scenarios of future transmission. Currently, there is scarce data corresponding to dominance of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the city, which may affect our estimates of dominance of variants. Also, our projections rely on our ability to project future social mixing patterns, which has proved challenging. For these reasons, we have considered scenarios of moderate and high social mixing levels over the coming months. Our model also relies on available data on vaccination efficacy or effectiveness against multiple variants. However, for some of them, there is still considerable uncertainty. These include, for instance, the effectiveness of CoronaVac/Sinovac vaccine against the delta variant, and of all the vaccines against the B.1.621 variant. Moreover, our model has not considered data on waning of immunity over time, but we consider parameters for loss of immune protection against infection after natural infection as a fixed parameter, according to literature available at the time. Also, our model assumes vaccine efficacy as a parameter but not many vaccine efficacy estimates against different variants are available and for that reason in some cases we have used vaccine effectiveness as a proxy for vaccine efficacy. We have also used estimates of vaccine efficacy against variants developed by other authors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>). Importantly, we have considered differential progression parameters for the original wild type virus and alpha and delta variants as reported in the literature. However, there is no information on those parameters for other variants. Another aspect not yet considered in our model is whether vaccination after previous infection may provide higher protection, or whether the efficacy of vaccines varies considerably according to characteristics of individuals, such as age or comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. This is particularly important in our context as we project a high attack rate before mass vaccination started. However, at the time of writing this manuscript, there is no information to parameterize these variations in efficacy within the model. Further work may also include estimates of the potential impact of boosters, particularly in high-risk populations.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>Time-varying trends of cases and deaths were obtained from public data sources. We used the daily number of deaths reported in Bogot&#x00E1; as of mid-July 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], population based seroprevalence data as of Nov, 2020 (based on anti-SARS CoV-2 IgG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], and available prevalence data on variants over the third wave in Bogota based on 120 samples from the epidemiological weeks 12 to 22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] to calibrate the model parameters. To represent changes in mobility, we used Google Mobility Reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] and Grandata project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>], both freely available online. Data on vaccination were obtained from datasets available online from the Ministry of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>](<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>). We obtained daily ICU bed demand from the Secretary of Health of Bogot&#x00E1;. Other data sources to create the synthetic population were obtained from official population projections by age for 2021[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], IPUMS-International [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and the Secretary of Education of Bogot&#x00E1;.</p>

<title>Model</title>
<p>We extended a previous version of our SARS-CoV-2 model for Bogot&#x00E1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] to include the potential effect of vaccination and variants. Our agent-based model simulates transmission of SARS-CoV-2 based on daily activity patterns of a synthetic population (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), representing demographic and geographic characteristics of the total population of Bogot&#x00E1;. Social mixing was considered in the model assuming two ways to increase contacts: mobility and average number of contacts. Mobility in the model represents the proportion of people who leave their household to participate in other activities, such as school or work. Community contacts are included in the model as an average number of contacts that an individual has in the community, given that the individual leaves the household. For instance, both mobility and community contacts may increase in holidays.</p>

</fig>
<p>We calibrated the model in a two-step fashion. First, we fitted parameters related to transmission of the original lineage of the virus by contrasting the model outputs to daily incidence of deaths reported from March 2020 to July 2021. Then, drawing from this calibrated distribution of parameters, we fitted parameters related to the transmissibility, immune escape (to immunity from natural infection), and introduction of the alpha, gamma, and B.1621 variants. In this step, we calibrated the model parameters to the daily incidence of deaths and the preliminary dominance data obtained from samples for epidemiologic weeks 12 to 22. Finally, the model was validated against the only available population-based seroprevalence study (conducted on November 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]) and daily ICU requests provided by the city&#x2019;s Secretary of Health. Parameters of the delta variant were assumed as the median value of estimates from other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Variant&#x2019;s parameters and importation</title>
<p>To calibrate the parameters related to transmission and immunity escape for the different variants, we used the ranges reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Table S2</xref>). The date of introduction of variants was estimated using reported cases from international travelers and the prevalence of variants in their countries of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], as well as the presence of the emerging B.1.621 variant in the country of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Hence, the total number of imported infections from variant &#x2018;<italic>v</italic>&#x2019; can be estimated as
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="21261734v2_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives>

where <italic>N(t)</italic> is the total imports detected in the city for time <italic>&#x2018;t&#x2019;</italic>;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;</sub> (&#x25A1;,&#x25A1;) is the dominance of variant <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;</italic> in country <italic>&#x2018;c&#x2019;</italic> at time &#x2018;<italic>t</italic>&#x2019; as reported at [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] as of June 30th, 2021; &#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;</sub> is the overall proportion of importations detected in the city from country &#x2018;<italic>c</italic>&#x2019;; and &#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;</sub> is a scaling factor estimated using daily deaths and dominance data from sequenced samples.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Vaccination</title>
<p>The model uses an &#x201C;<italic>all-or-nothing&#x201D;</italic> assumption regarding the effect of vaccination, which means that the vaccine provides no protection at all to a fraction of the vaccinated persons and perfect lifetime immunity to the rest of the vaccinated ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Other studies have reported contrasting this modelling approach with one using a <italic>&#x201C;leaky&#x201D;</italic> assumption about the effect of vaccination, and have not found substantial differences for their projections about the potential impact of different vaccination strategies against SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Vaccination parameters</title>
<p>based on the vaccination efficacy (VE) against disease (&#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;&#x25A1;</sub>), we used a function of both the efficacy against infection &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;</sub> and against the progression from infection to disease &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;</sub>, which under a multiplicative and independent relationship can be expressed as &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;&#x25A1;</sub> = <italic>1</italic> &#x2212; (<italic>1</italic> &#x2212; &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;</sub>)(<italic>1</italic> &#x2212; &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. The efficacy against hospitalization could also be expressed as &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sup>&#x25A1;</sup><sub>&#x25A1;&#x25A1;</sub> = <italic>1</italic> &#x2212; (<italic>1</italic> &#x2212; &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;</sub>) (<italic>1</italic> &#x2212; &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;</sub>) (<italic>1</italic> &#x2212; &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sup>&#x25A1;</sup><sub>&#x25A1;</sub>). We used reported &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;&#x25A1;</sub> and &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sup>&#x25A1;</sup><sub>&#x25A1;&#x25A1;</sub> to calculate &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;</sub> and &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sup>&#x25A1;</sup><sub>&#x25A1;</sub>. Given the uncertainty about the vaccine efficacy against infection, we assumed different values of &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;</sub> (equal to 50% or 100% of &#x25A1;&#x25A1;<sub>&#x25A1;&#x25A1;</sub>).</p>
<p>We included four vaccines currently used in Colombia, namely, Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZD1222), Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, CoronaVac/Sinovac, and Janssen (J&#x0026;J) Ad26.COV2.S. We used vaccine efficacy as reported from the clinical trials, except when the trial had not enough power to report efficacy (i.e. severe disease, death) or estimates were not available, in which case, results from observational studies were used. The point estimate and confidence intervals for the protection against symptomatic, and severe disease are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>.</p>
<p>We considered that the protective effect of vaccines starts after a period that can vary between 7 and 15 days after the first and the second dose according to what is reported for each vaccine (Refs in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Table S1</xref>). We assumed that vaccines have some level of protection against infection. Given the uncertainty in this regard, in our main analyses we assumed that protection against infection is 50% of that reported for symptomatic disease. We also considered an alternative scenario of efficacy against infection being 100% of the efficacy against symptomatic disease. The arrival of each type of vaccine and the maximum number of vaccines delivered each day were determined by the vaccination delivery reports by the country&#x2019;s Ministry of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], as shown in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>. To project the future delivery of vaccines, we assumed constant availability with the proportion of vaccine types determined by the current one. In terms of the daily capacity of vaccine administration, we assumed that the current daily vaccination rates would remain until the target population is completely vaccinated. We also assume a probability of vaccine uptake of 90%.</p>
<p>Of note, we have assumed that VE against hospitalization for the alpha variant with one dose is substantially different compared to the same VE for the delta variant. For this parameter we have used VE as vaccine effectiveness reported, which has not been peer-reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Simulation scenarios</title>
<p>We assessed the potential impact of delta variant introduction in the city by calibrating the transmission model to current patterns and projecting the number of deaths and the demand for ICU beds, from August to November 2021. The baseline scenario used the calibrated parameters for alpha, gamma, and B.1.621. For delta, we assumed the median value of studies reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. The scaling factor of imports of delta was assumed to be a middle point similar to values calibrated to the alpha and gamma variants.</p>
<p>We simulated a set of scenarios to calculate the impact of mobility and the timing of the introduction of the delta variant. To evaluate the potential impact of mobility and contacts on the future dynamics of COVID-19 due to the delta variant, we simulated two different scenarios of mobility and contacts. The baseline scenario assumed the current levels of mobility and moderate contacts. We also considered a scenario of high mobility and high contacts, which assumed that contacts increased to the levels observed during December 2020. We evaluated two additional scenarios for the timing of the introduction of the delta variant: 30 or 60 days later than our baseline estimates.</p>
<p>We simulated alternative scenarios of vaccination considering: the increase in the vaccination capacity from 50,000 to 100,000 vaccines per day, a delivery with no age-based prioritization for future administration in contrast with the current age-prioritized strategy, and the postponing of the second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech&#x2019;s BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (from 21 to 84 days). We calculated the effect of these administration strategies on the cumulative number of deaths and ICU beds required from August 1st to November 1st, 2021, and the differences with the baseline scenario.</p>
