<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells directed against CD19 have achieved impressive outcomes for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B lineage lymphoid neoplasms. However, CAR-T therapy still has important limitations due to severe side effects and the lack of efficiency in 40-50&#x0025; of the patients. Most CARs-T products are generated using retroviral vectors with strong promoters. However, high CAR expression levels can lead to tonic signalling, premature exhaustion and over-stimulation of CAR-T cells, reducing efficacy and increasing side effects. TCR-like expression of the CAR through genome editing resulted in enhanced anti-tumour potency, reducing tonic signalling and improving CAR-T phenotype. In this manuscript, we searched for LVs that mimic the TCR expression pattern as a closer-to-clinic alternative for the generation of improved CAR-T cells.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Different LVs containing viral and human promoters were analysed to select those that closely mimic a TCR-like kinetic profile upon T-cell activation. <italic>WAS</italic> gene proximal promoter-driven LVs (AW-LVs) were selected to express a second generation 4-1BB aCD19 CAR (ARI-0001) into T cells to generate AWARI CAR-T cells. TCR-like AWARI and EF1&#x03B1;-driven ARI CAR T cells were analysed for <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> killing efficiency using leukaemia and lymphoma cellular models. Tonic signalling, exhaustion markers and phenotype were determined by flow cytometry. Large-scale automated manufacturing of AWARI CAR-T cells was performed in a CliniMACs Prodigy bioreactor.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Our data showed that LVs expressing the transgene through the <italic>WAS</italic> gene proximal promoter mimic very closely the TCR (CD3) expression pattern kinetic upon TCR stimulation or antigen encounter. Compared to EF1&#x03B1;-driven ARI CAR-T cells, AWARI CAR-T cells exhibited a higher proportion of na&#x00EF;ve/stem cell memory T cells with less exhausted phenotype after efficient killing of CD19&#x002B; cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. AWARI CAR-T cells also showed lower tonic signalling and reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and were efficiently manufactured in large-scale GMP-like conditions.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p><italic>WAS-gene</italic>-promoter driven LVs can be used to generate physiological 4-1BB-CAR-T cell products with lower tonic signalling, improved phenotype and a safer profile. We propose the use of TCR-like LVs as an alternative to strong-promoter driven LVs for the generation of CAR-T products.</p></sec>

<title>BACKGROUND</title>
<p>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of cancer in particular for B lineage lymphoid neoplasms using &#x03B1;CD19-CAR-T cells, as emphasized with four FDA/EMA-approved Advance Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs): tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah, Novartis), axicabtageneciloleucel (Yescarta, Kite-Gilead), brexucabtagene autoleucel (Tecartus, Kite-Gilead) and lisocabtagenemaraleucel (Breyanzi, Bristol Myers Squibb). However, in spite of the impressive results of &#x03B1;CD19-CAR-T cells, there are still several aspects that must be improved. Aggressive severe side effects due to CAR-T overstimulation, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neuroinflammation are common among treated patients and can lead to fatal outcomes. Furthermore, sustained complete remissions range from 62&#x0025; to 42&#x0025; for patients treated with commercial ATMPs, evidencing much room for improvement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Different works have uncovered the importance of controlling CAR expression levels at the surface of the CAR-T cells in order to optimize its therapeutic activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. In spite of this, all four approved ATMPs approved and most of those that are been tested in ongoing clinical trials use autologous T cells transduced with retroviral vectors expressing a &#x03B1;CD19-CAR through constitutive, strong promoters such as the human EF1&#x03B1; and the murine stem cell virus LTR (MSCV). High CARs concentrations on the T cell surface can result in spontaneous clustering of the CARs (independent of the ligand) leading to tonic-signalling<sup>45</sup>. This tonic signalling can affect safety (pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion in non-target tissues) and efficacy (premature exhaustion due to continuous proliferation) of CAR-T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, high-density and constitutive CAR presence on the T cell surface can also lead to overstimulation upon antigen recognition that also affect safety (excess of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion) and efficacy (early exhaustion, apoptosis and loss of T<sub>N/SCM</sub> phenotype) of the CAR-T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In this direction, Eyquem et al. generated CAR-T cells expressing the &#x03B1;CD19-28&#x03B6; CAR through the endogenous T cell receptor constant alpha chain (TRAC) locus using CRISPR/Cas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In this manuscript, the authors concluded that tight transcriptional regulation of CAR expression, lowering CAR levels upon target binding and recovering 1-3 days later, was critical for optimal CAR-T performance. However, despite the great potential of genome editing tools for therapeutic applications, there are still several technological and safety issues that need to be solved before the approval of genome edited cells as ATMPs.</p>
<p>Contrary to genome editing tools, lentiviral vectors (LVs) derived from HIV-1 have already been approved by the FDA and EMA (Kymriah, Breyanzi and Zynteglo). Latest generation LVs are very resistant to transgene silencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and allow the control of the transgene through physiological or drug inducible promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. We therefore searched for LVs that express transgenes on T cells following a TCR expression kinetic. Since the TRAC promoter in human mature T cells is not well defined, we focus in a well-defined promoter that controls the expression of the WASP protein, which is involved in the formation of the immunological synapse and in translating TCR signals to several T cells functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We reason that <italic>WAS-</italic> promoter driven LVs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> could be an interesting option to express CARs due to their moderate expression levels and the functional relationship with the TCR. Here we showed that, indeed, <italic>WAS</italic>-promoter driven LVs partially mimicked the TCR expression kinetic both in eGFP- and CAR-expressing LVs, with a small down-regulation upon stimulation and recovering basal levels in 5-7 days. Based on these data, we generated TCR-like CAR-T cells using LVs and analysed potential improvements compared to standard CAR-T cells expressing the CAR through strong promoters. TCR-like expression of a aCD19-CAR lead to lower tonic signalling in the absence of antigen as well as a better response in its presence, with lower exhaustion markers, lower proinflammatory cytokine secretion and improved phenotype both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Nalm6 (ATCC&#x00AE; CRL-3273), Namalwa (ATCC&#x00AE; CRL-1432), Jurkat (ATCC&#x00AE; TIB-152), HL-60 (ATCC&#x00AE; CCL-240) and HEK-293T (ATCC&#x00AE; CRL-11268) cells were cultured as described elsewhere. Namalwa and Nalm6 were modified to express enhanced GFP (eGFP) and Nanoluciferase (NanoLuc) using the SELWP, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Human samples</title>
<p>Primary T cells were isolated from fresh or frozen apheresis products obtained from healthy donors at the Hematology Department of the Hospital Universitario Reina Sof&#x00ED;a (C&#x00F3;rdoba, Spain). All donors gave their written informed consent and the study was performed according to the guidelines of the local ethics committee and complies with the requirements regarding quality and safety for donation, obtaining, storage, distribution, and preservation of human cells and tissues under the Spanish specific regulation (RD-L 9/2014). Pan-T cells were isolated by negative selection using immunomagnetic beads (Pan T cell Isolation Kit, Miltenyi Biotec) and following MACSExpress Separator (Miltenyi Biotec) or AutoMACs Pro Separator&#x2019;s (Miltenyi Biotec) protocol and cultured in TexMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) supplemented with 20 UI/ml of IL-2 (Miltenyi Biotec). T cells were activated with T Cell TransAct (Miltenyi Biotec).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Plasmid constructs</title>
<p>To construct the SELWP vector, a self-inactivated (SIN) LV expressing eGFP and NanoLuc under the spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) promoter, an eGFP-P2A-NanoLuc (NanoLuc sequence obtained from GeneBank accession: JQ437370. Nucleotides 100-616) flanked by AscI/SbfI restriction sites was designed and synthesized by Genscript (Genscript USA Inc. NY, U.S.A). The eGFP-P2A-NLuc was cloned into the SEWP LV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> by standard molecular biology techniques to obtain the SELWP.</p>
<p>We used self-inactivated LVs-driven eGFP already available in our laboratory. SE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, CEWP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and EFEWP (our laboratory) driving eGFP under the control of SFFV, cytomegalovirus, and EF1a promoters, respectively. <italic>WAS</italic>-promoter based LVs: WE-LVs harbours 0.5kb of the <italic>WAS</italic> proximal promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, and the AWE-LVs include 0.5kb of the <italic>WAS</italic> proximal promoter and 0.38 kb of the alternative promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For AWARI LVs generation, the AW promoter were obtained from the AWE <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> by ClaI / BamHI and inserted into the ARI-0001 plasmid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, replacing the EF1a promoter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Lentiviral vector production and titration</title>
<p>Lentiviral vectors were generated by co-transfection of HEK-293T cells with the plasmid of interest, the plasmid pCMVDR8.91and the p-MD-G plasmid as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. LVs were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 90.000g for 2h at 4&#x00B0;C, resuspended in TexMACs and storaged at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C. LVs titters were determined by transducing Jurkat cells with different dilutions of viral supernatant. Percentage of positive cells was determined by flow cytometry and transducing units per ml (TU/ml) were estimated according to the formula: (10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> plated cells &#x00D7; &#x0025; of positive cells)]/ml of LV.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>T cell transduction</title>
<p>Activated primary T cells were transduced with the different LVs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 through spinoculation (800 x g for 60 min at 32&#x00B0;C). Media was exchanged after 5 hours of incubation. At 4-6 days after transduction, the percentage of transduced cells was determined by flow cytometry.</p>

<p>CAR expression was determined with a biotin-conjugated goat anti-murine Fab SP-longer Spacer IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) and APC-conjugated streptavidin (ThermoFisher). For human T cell phenotyping the following mAbs were used: CD45RA-PE/FITC (HI-100), CD62L-PE-Cy7 (DREG56), CD3-PerCP-Cy5/APC-780 (OKT3), PD1-APC (MIH4), LAG-3-PE (3DS223H), TIM-3-APC-Cy7 (F38-2E2) all from eBioscience (ThermoFisher). Tonic signalling was determined by intracellular staining with pCD3z-PE (Tyr142, 3ZBR4S) and Fix &#x0026; Perm Kit (Nordic Bio). Samples were acquired on a FACSCantoII cytometer. FlowJo software (TreeStar) was used for data analysis.</p>

Re-challenge was assessed by re-inoculating intravenously a new dose of Namalwa-GFP-Nluc cells. Our experiments are based on a modified randomized block design in which each block receives more than one treatment at different periods. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive the different treatments (PBS, T cells or CAR-T cells). This will allow a comparison between the different treatment groups in pairs (each one compared to the control and each one compared to each other). For the estimation of the sample size in each experiment, we calculated the sample size necessary to obtain a p &#x2265; 0.05 to be of n &#x2265; 5 for controls/CAR-T comparison and an n &#x2265; 8 for AWARI/ARI comparisons based on Mayer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. For bioluminescence analysis, furimazine (Nano-Glo, Promega) was diluted at 1/60 in PBS and injected intraperitoneally immediately prior to acquisition on an IVIS Spectrum analyzer (Caliper, Perkin Elmer). Images were acquired during 180s, open field, and analysed using the Living Image 3.2 (Perkin Elmer) or AURA Imaging Software 3.2 (Spectral Instruments Imaging). Mice were sacrificed if experiencing a weight loss greater than 20&#x0025; or at the indicated days. Samples of blood, bone marrow, liver, spleen and brain were collected. Blood was extracted and diluted 1/5 in EDTA. Cells were obtained from liver and spleen by mechanical disruption and from bone marrow by the perfusion of both femurs and tibias. Brain&#x2019;s cells were obtained after Percoll-gradient separation. Percentage of surviving Namalwa-GFP-Nluc and T cells (hCD3&#x002B;) were determined by FACS in the singlet&#x2019;s gate and then in &#x201C;human cells&#x201D; gate, which was previously established after acquiring an artificial mixture of Namalwa cells and human T cells used as control.</p>

<title><italic>WAS</italic> promoter-driven LVs mimic the TCR expression pattern upon T-cell activation</title>
<p>As LVs have already been approved by EMA and the FDA, LVs expressing the CARs with a similar kinetic than the TCR (TCR-like LVs) could be a real alternative to existing LVs to generate more potent and safer CAR-T cells. We first investigated whether <italic>WAS</italic>-promoter-driven LVs could have a more physiological expression pattern compared to current LVs used for CAR-T cells generation. We generated eGFP-expressing LVs particles from two different <italic>WAS</italic>-pronioter-driven LVs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>, WE and AWE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and three LVs driven by strong promoters (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>, CEWP, SE and EFEWP).</p>

<p>In order to analyse if the <italic>WAS</italic>-promoter-driven LVs mimic the TCR expression pattern, we first studied the CD3 expression levels (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Fig. S1a</bold>) of primary human T cells after stimulation with &#x03B1;CD3/&#x03B1;CD28 nanomatrix and CD19&#x002B; cells (in CAR&#x002B; cells, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and Fig S1b</bold>) at different time-points. In parallel, T cells transduced with the different eGFP-expressing LVs were stimulated and analysed by flow cytometry as described in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>. As it has been reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, CD3 expression in T cells decreased soon after stimulation reaching minimal expression at 24h/48h at both protein and mRNA levels and recover basal levels after 5-7 days (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, S1a</bold>). Contrary to the CD3 expression pattern, all LVs harbouring constitutive-strong promoters (EF1a (EFEWP), SFFV (SE) and CMV (CEWP)), behaved in an opposite manner, increasing eGFP expression soon after T cell stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>-top panels, <bold>1D</bold> and <bold>1E</bold>-orange line). Interestingly, <italic>WAS</italic>-promoter driven LVs partially mimicked the TCR expression kinetic, down-regulating eGFP expression upon stimulation that peak at 48h and recover basal levels after 7 days (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>-bottom panels, <bold>1E-</bold>blue and green lines).</p>
<p>We next investigated whether CARs expressed by <italic>WAS</italic>-promoter driven LVs also followed a TCR-like kinetic. We constructed the AWARI LV (see M&#x0026;M for details) based on the ARI-0001 LV backbone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, a CAR19-BBzz recently approved as ATMP in Spain, which uses the A1B6 clone as scFv (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. <bold>1F</bold></xref>). We then generated ARI and AWARI CAR-T cells using the ARI and AWARI LVs and analysed their CAR expression kinetic upon activation with CD19&#x002B; cells <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref></bold>-left,<bold>1H</bold> and <bold>S1B</bold>-left) or &#x03B1;CD3/&#x03B1;CD28 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref></bold>-right, <bold>1I</bold> and <bold>S1B</bold>-right). Interestingly, AWARI CAR-T cells showed a down-regulation of CAR levels after antigenic stimulation and a recovery after 48h (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H, 1I</xref></bold>, blue line; <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref></bold>, bottom panel), while ARI CAR-T cells showed a clear increment on CAR levels after T cell activation (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H, 1I</xref></bold>, green lines, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref></bold>, top panel). A similar behaviour was also observed when using a third generation &#x03B1;CD19-CAR-28BBzz (<bold>Fig S1C, S1D</bold>). Altogether, our results showed that the AW-LVs can be used to generate CAR-T cells expressing the CAR in a TCR-like manner.</p>

<title>TCR-like expression of CAR prevents exhaustion and control proinflammatory cytokines secretion upon antigen exposure <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>We next compared the behaviour of 2<sup>nd</sup> generation ARI versus AWARI CAR-T cells. First, we measured basal levels of exhaustion markers (LAG-3, PD1, Tim3) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>) and tonic signalling (phospho-CD3z) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>) in a CD19-independent context. AWARI CAR-T cells expressed significant lower levels of LAG-3 and Tim3 (and also a trend for PD1) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>) and less phosphorylation of CD3z (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Both CAR-T cells efficiently killed CD19&#x002B; Nalm6 (B-ALL derived) and Namalwa (Hodgkin&#x2019;s lymphoma derived), without significant differences (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Interestingly, LAG-3 expression levels were significantly lower in AWARI compared to ARI CAR-T cells after killing Namalwa cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>, right). In addition, AWARI CAR-T cells secreted lower levels of TNF&#x03B1; and IFN&#x03B3; compared to ARI cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>), indicating a more controlled proinflammatory activity. We also observed a tendency of increased stem memory T cells (CD45RA&#x002B;CD62L&#x002B;) population in AWARI versus ARI CAR-T cell (but not statically significant, <bold>Figs. S2D, S2E</bold>). Finally, similar observations were found when 3<sup>rd</sup> generation CARs (CAR19-28BBzz) were expressed with the AW-LVs in terms of lower tonic signalling (<bold>Fig S2A</bold>) and milder IFN&#x03B3; secretion (<bold>Fig. S2B</bold>).</p>

Samples at days 7 and 10 for batch #01, and 6 and 9 days for batch #02 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>) were collected to study CAR expression (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>), viability, expansion (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref></bold>), CD4/CD8 ratio (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref></bold>), phenotype (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref></bold>), and <italic>in vitro</italic> lytic activity (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref></bold>). In both productions processes, cells were efficiently expanded, with more CD4&#x002B; than CD8&#x002B; CAR&#x002B; cells and prominent T<sub>N</sub>/<sub>SCM</sub> (CCR7&#x002B; CD62L&#x002B;) subset (44,85 &#x00B1;0.07&#x0025;) at day 7 or day 6, that were drastically reduced at final day of the production (16,55 &#x00B1;13.93&#x0025;), turning into T<sub>CM</sub> cells but with minimal effector and effector memory populations (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref></bold>). As described for other CAR-T cell products, lower expansion times rendered more potent AWARI CAR-T cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref></bold>). All these results point out to the AWARI LVs as a valuable tool for a future clinical trial, although improvements in its lentiviral backbone could further increase transduction efficacy in order to lower costs and time of production.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>&#x03B1;CD19 CAR-T cells have achieved impressive therapeutic benefits in R/R B lineage lymphoid neoplasms, leading to the approval of Kymriah, Yescarta, Tecartus and Breyanzi and over 800 clinical trials around the globe. Most of these studies have used autologous T cells that are gene modified by retrovirus-based vectors to express the CAR through a strong promoter (often the EF1&#x03B1; or MSCV promoters). However, CAR-T therapy still has important limitations due to severe side effects and the lack of complete cures in 40-62&#x0025; of the CD19&#x002B; lymphomas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and most solid tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Improvements in CAR structure (scFV, hinge/spacer, costimulatory domains, bi-especific or multispecific CARs, etc) T cell composition or combinational therapies have already shown improved results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. New approaches to improve CAR-T efficacy and/or safety include the control of CAR activity and or other molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and mechanism to avoid immune-reactions against the CAR-T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There are several evidences indicating that high levels and continuous expression of the CAR can be deleterious for the efficacy and safety of the CAR-T products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The loss of efficacy comes in part from the early exhaustion and/or apoptosis of the CAR-T cells due to an excess of CAR signalling after antigen encounter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Strong and unregulated CAR expression also increase tonic signalling in the absence of target antigen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> promoting exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. On the other side, safety issues due to CAR overexpression relates to the increased antigen-independent tonic signalling and to over-stimulation of CAR-T cells that generate CRS. Using genome editing technologies, Eyquem et al. demonstrated that TCR-like expression of CARs resulted in lower tonic signalling, reduced CAR-T exhaustion and increased proportion of TSM/TN CAR-T cells, resulting in improved anti-tumour activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. These authors also showed that low expression was not enough to achieve optimal CAR-T products, concluding that a down-regulation of the CAR upon antigen encounter was required for optimal CAR-T performance.</p>
<p>In this manuscript we investigated whether LVs can be used to obtain a TCR-like expression kinetics that could also result in an improved CAR-T cell product. Our search for human promoters that could mimic the TCR expression pattern pointed to the TRAC locus, however, the TRAC promoter in mature human T cells is not well defined. We therefore focus on the <italic>WAS</italic> gene promoter because WASP protein is only expressed in hematopoietic cells, is involved in the formation of the immunological synapse and acts as an adaptor of TCR signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We have previously developed different <italic>WAS</italic>-gene based promoters and identified the AW promoter, harbouring fragments from the alternative and proximal promoter, as the best option to express transgenes in hematopoietic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Here we showed that, indeed, <italic>WAS</italic>-promoter driven LVs (AW-LVs) partially mimicked the TCR expression kinetic, with a small downregulation upon stimulation and recovering basal levels in 5-7 days.</p>
<p>Based on the ability of AW-LVs to mimic TCR expression pattern on T cells, we investigated whether 4-1BB-CAR-T cells generated with this &#x201C;physiological&#x201D; LVs have a better behaviour compared to that generated with LVs harbouring strong or viral promoters. Although in terms of <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumour activity we could not detect significant differences with EF1&#x03B1;-driven CAR-T cells, AW-CAR-T cells exhibited lower tonic signalling and a better phenotype after efficient killing of CD19&#x002B; cells, with reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These data is largely in agreement with the observations of Eyquem et al. using genome editing technologies to express the CAR through the TRAC locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. However, these authors also showed improved <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumour activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The differences in the tumour model (Nalm6 versus Namalwa) as well as in the CAR signalling domain (CD28 versus 4-1BB) and scFv (FMC63 versus A3B1) could explain the observed differences. Indeed, the potential deleterious effects of CAR over-expression and tonic signalling are highly influenced by the CAR configuration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. For instance, replacing CD28 with the 4-1BB costimulatory domain reversed exhaustion in CAR T cells and improved its persistence and therapeutic efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The good behaviour of EF1&#x03B1;-driven 4-1BB-CARs T cells and the experimental limitations derived by the graft versus host disease (GVHD) caused by the administration of the CAR-T cells can explain the absence of increased therapeutic efficacy in our animal models.</p>
<p>In spite of the good behaviour of 4-1BB-CARs, Gomes-Silva et al demonstrated that very high expression levels of 4-1BB-CARs also lead to apoptosis and limit CAR-T cells expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The same authors also showed that lowering it expression levels by using EF1&#x03B1;-driven LVs instead of LTR-driven &#x25A1;-retroviral vector, improved phenotype, expansion potential and therapeutic efficacy. These studies showed that EF1&#x03B1;-driven LVs already generate a good CAR product for some 4-1BB-CARs. Here we show that TCR-like expression can further improve 4-1BB-CAR-T products, in particular for the ARI-0001, by maintaining a better phenotype and controlling tonic signalling and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.</p>
<p>An important aspect to consider in CAR-T cells is the potential side effects due to overstimulation and/or inadequate stimulation. Severe CRS (grades 3 or 4) is an important hallmark in CD19&#x002B; that can compromise efficacy and lead to life-threatening conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Upon tumour cell encounter, CAR-T cells release different pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x03B1;, IFN&#x25A1;, IL-1 and GM-CSF that leads to macrophage recruitment and activation causing a dangerous cytokine storm involving IL-6 and GM-CSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. It has also been demonstrated that activation of macrophages through CD40/CD40L, CD69 and LAG-3 also contributes to massive activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Although CRS can be managed with corticosteroids and anti-IL6R (Tocilizumab), these interventions also block T cell activation compromising CAR-T efficacy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In this manuscript, we have shown that CAR-T cells generated with AW-LVs exhibit a milder secretion of TNF&#x03B1; and IFN&#x25A1; after tumour cells encounter. In addition, we noted that LAG-3 expression was reduced after Namalwa interaction which suggests that AW-CAR-T cells could lower the risk of CRS.</p>
<p>We finally investigated the feasibility of generating a viable CAR-T cell product for clinical translation. Here, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to generate TCR-like CAR-T cells in a CliniMACs Prodigy, with high cell viability, predominant stem and CM populations and potent <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-tumour activity. In contrast and consistent with our comparative results, ARI-0001 generated more memory and effector memory population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, highlighting another potential advantage of AW-CAR-T cells during the manufacturing process. On the other hand, the efficacy of transduction was lower compared to ARI (&#x223C; 18.4&#x0025; vs &#x223C;30.6&#x0025;), suggesting that a future optimization of the AWARI LV backbone could further improve the manufacturing process of AW-CAR-T cells.</p>
<p>Taken all together, we propose the use of AW-LVs as an alternative platform for the manufacturing of CAR-T cells in order to provide better efficacies and/or safety of the final products. The final benefits of expressing different CARs through the AW promoter will need to be determined in each case.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this work we showed that LVs expressing the transgene through the <italic>WAS</italic> gene proximal promoter mimic very closely the TCR expression pattern kinetic in T cells. 4-1BB-CAR-T cells generated with <italic>WAS-</italic>promoter-driven LVs (AWARI CAR-T) exhibited a higher proportion of Na&#x00EF;ve/Stem Cell Memory T cells, less exhausted phenotype, lower tonic signalling and reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to EF1-driven ARI CAR-T. Finally, AWARI CAR-T cells were efficiently manufactured in large-scale GMP-like conditions. Altogether, our data showed that the AW-LVs can be used to generate improved, physiological 4-1BB-CAR-T cell products and propose these LVs as efficient tools for the generation of clinical-grade TCR-like CAR-T cells.</p>
