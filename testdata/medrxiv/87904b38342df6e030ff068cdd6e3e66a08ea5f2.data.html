<meta name="DC.Description" content="Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heritable disorder, but no definitive, replicated OCD susceptibility loci have yet been identified by any genome-wide association study (GWAS). Here, we report results from a GWAS in the largest OCD case-control sample (N = 14,140 OCD cases and N = 562,117 controls) to date. We explored the genetic architecture of OCD, including its genetic relationships to other psychiatric and non-psychiatric phenotypes. In the GWAS analysis, we identified one SNP associated with OCD at a genome-wide significant level. Subsequent gene-based analyses identified additional two genes as potentially implicated in OCD pathogenesis. All SNPs combined explained 16% of the heritability of OCD. We show sub-stantial positive genetic correlations between OCD and a range of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa, and major depression. We thus for the first time provide evidence of a genome-wide locus implicated in OCD and strengthen previous literature suggesting a polygenic nature of this disorder.

<meta name="citation_abstract" lang="en" content="&lt;p&gt;Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heritable disorder, but no definitive, replicated OCD susceptibility loci have yet been identified by any genome-wide association study (GWAS). Here, we report results from a GWAS in the largest OCD case- control sample (N = 14,140 OCD cases and N = 562,117 controls) to date. We explored the genetic architecture of OCD, including its genetic relationships to other psychiatric and non-psychiatric phenotypes. In the GWAS analysis, we identified one SNP associated with OCD at a genome-wide significant level. Subsequent gene-based analyses identified additional two genes as potentially implicated in OCD pathogenesis. All SNPs combined explained 16% of the heritability of OCD. We show substantial positive genetic correlations between OCD and a range of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa, and major depression. We thus for the first time provide evidence of a genome-wide locus implicated in OCD and strengthen previous literature suggesting a polygenic nature of this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;" />

<meta name="twitter:description" content="Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heritable disorder, but no definitive, replicated OCD susceptibility loci have yet been identified by any genome-wide association study (GWAS). Here, we report results from a GWAS in the largest OCD case-control sample (N = 14,140 OCD cases and N = 562,117 controls) to date. We explored the genetic architecture of OCD, including its genetic relationships to other psychiatric and non-psychiatric phenotypes. In the GWAS analysis, we identified one SNP associated with OCD at a genome-wide significant level. Subsequent gene-based analyses identified additional two genes as potentially implicated in OCD pathogenesis. All SNPs combined explained 16% of the heritability of OCD. We show sub-stantial positive genetic correlations between OCD and a range of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa, and major depression. We thus for the first time provide evidence of a genome-wide locus implicated in OCD and strengthen previous literature suggesting a polygenic nature of this disorder.

The NORDiC-NOR study was approved by the Norwegian Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC-West) under project number 2018/52 REKVest (PI Bjarne Hansen) and project number: 2014/75 REKVest (PI: Jan Haavik). The Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board oversees BioVU and approved this project (IRB201609). Individual level data analysis in the EstBB was carried out under ethical approval from the Estonian Committee on Bioethics and Human Research (Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs) and data release N05 from the EstBB. This research was approved to be conducted under that approval by the governing Research Ethics Committee of the UK Biobank. The analyses in this paper were performed under an approved extension to project 16577.

I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.

Yes

I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).

Yes

I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.

Yes

Results from this study can be made available upon request to the authors as part of our standardized secondary analysis proposal program (please contact the corresponding author).

Here, we report results from a GWAS in the largest OCD case-control sample (N = 14,140 OCD cases and N = 562,117 controls) to date. We explored the genetic architecture of OCD, including its genetic relationships to other psychiatric and non-psychiatric phenotypes. In the GWAS analysis, we identified one SNP associated with OCD at a genome-wide significant level. Subsequent gene-based analyses identified additional two genes as potentially implicated in OCD pathogenesis. All SNPs combined explained 16% of the heritability of OCD. We show sub-stantial positive genetic correlations between OCD and a range of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa, and major depression. We thus for the first time provide evidence of a genome-wide locus implicated in OCD and strengthen previous literature suggesting a polygenic nature of this disorder.</p></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-5">Ole Andreassen is a consultant to HealthLytix and has received speakers honorarium from Lundbeck and Sunovion in the past.
