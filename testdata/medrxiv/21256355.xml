<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), an emerging infectious disease resulted from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has pose enormous threat to public health[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The epidemiological and serological characteristics of patients with COVID-19, have been explicitly reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], but the seropervalence, serological characteristics and immunnity of convalescents remain largely obscure.</p>
<p>Antibody response is crucial to eliminate viral infection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], and the seroprevalence of specific serum antibodies immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G(IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 can provide immune protection. Understanding seroprevalence dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 assists to assess the immune levels of convalescents, and it also helps to predict the potential protection in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. As the number of patients recovering from the SARS-CoV-2 continues to increase, the duration of individual serological responses has also sparked public attention[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. It is important to know whether and how demographic factors (such as age, gender, origin and type) affect serological responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In several countries, initial case reports have symptomatic to be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. There is an urgent need to understand how long the antibody response to the virus will last after infection. For one thing, monitoring specific antibodies can benefit to distinguish vaccine-related antibodies from infected-stimulated ones[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. For another, the study of serological dynamic also help to understand the associated serological epidemiology.</p>
<p>IgM is the first immune response against viral infection, and IgG production lags behind IgM but provides long-term immunity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], similar to coronavirus infections such as SARS and MERS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Usually IgM antibodies last less time in the body, and previous studies in SARS patients have shown that specific IgM antibodies last for 13 weeks in the body[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], as well as IgG antibodies are longstanding with an average of about 2 years[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. The decline of IgM is seen as a indicator of virus clearance and convalescents could have robust immunity against re-infection with positove antibody, the reduction of IgG prompt serious concerns on the robustness and persistence of immunity after recovering[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], which is primary for developing vaccine and making immunity strategy. Studying the risk factors and dynamic change of different antibodies can help to understand the body&#x2019;s resistance to SARS-CoV-2 at different stages. At the same time, information regarding the persistence of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitate the continued development of new vaccines and clinical therapeutics[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. In our study, the serological level of 177 convalescents of SARS-CoV-2 in Sichuan Province were reviewed and analyzed. At present, the literature reported that the seroprevalence of specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies persisted to 8 months[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], but the positive antibody duration still needs to update.</p>
<p>However, most of previous researches have mainly spotlighted on the acute response within several weeks after clinical onset in SARS-CoV-2. While the number of convalescents infected with SARS-CoV-2 started to escalate, evaluating and understanding the immune response becomes even more essential. This study intends to assess whether seroprevalence is associated with demographic factors, such as gender, age, type (symptomatic cases or asymptomatic cases) and travel history(domestic or international). Meanwhile, we aims to describe the serum dynamic changes and durability of convalescents of SARS-CoV-2.. It is expected that serological study of SARS-Cov-2 convalescents during the recovery period will benefit to understand the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, It also provides an auxiliary scientific basis for clinical development and evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>This study is a retrospective cohort study that included 177 convalescents in Sichuan Province as of November 23, 2020. All subjects voluntarily joined serological researches with informed consent. 363 serum samples and demographic characteristics of 177 convalescents were collected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Data and specimen collection</title>
<p>The data was collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Sichuan Province, and consisted of the demographic characteristics of the 177 convalescents and their longitudina antibody results (363 serum samples) till November 23, 2020. Specimens were collected from June 23, 2020 on the basis of voluntary informed consent of COVID-19 convalescents. Volunteers can withdraw from the study at any time in accordance with the principle of informed consent. All 363 serum samples were detected by the Institute of Microbiology and Analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Detection of IgG and IgM</title>
<p>Non-anticoagulant specimens (intravenous blood collection) were collected for all subjects, 3mL for children (&#x003C;5 years), and 5mL for others. Serum samples were collected and loaded into sealed bags in accordance with Class A transport packaging, refrigerated and transported to the local CDC laboratory for serum separation. The isolated serum was stored in a 1.5 mL freezed deposit tube at -20 degrees C. The Mike i1000 fully automated luminescent immunoanalystator (base fluid lot number: 0520153; reagent lot number: 0520031,0520032; reaction cup lot number: 0720582;) was utilized to test serum by the principle of direct chemical luminescence immunoanalysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Ethical approval</title>
<p>The survey was discussed with the Ethics Committee of Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Sichuan Province, who reviewed the content. And the ethical approval was given. All participants assented informed consent before participation, and this study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice(GCP). This study was performed in compliance with all relevant ethical regulations and the protocol for human subject studies was approved by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Sichuan Province(SCCDCIRB-2020-007).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize the demographic characteristics of the cohort and significant study outcome variables. Frequency and composition ratio were used for categorical variables, Chi&#x2013;square test and Fisher&#x2019;s exact test were used for comparing categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95&#x0025; confidence interval.</p>
<p>Demographic characteristics consisted of variables including gender, age groups (&#x003C; 20 years old, 20-40 years old, 40-60 years old and &#x2265; 60 years old), travel history(domestic or international), type (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and antibody results (positive or negative). We considered the antibody results as outcome, and it was divided into two groups (positive or negative), previous studies have found that gender and age were related to the results of the antibody[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Frequency and composition ratio were used to describe the total number of specific antibodies of different durations. The seroprevalence changes and positive rates of specific antibodies IgM and IgG over time were plotted. All analyses were performed by Stata 16.0 software, the p-value less than 0.05 in this paper was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Demographic and Clinical Characteristics</title>
<p>By November 23, 2020, A total of 177 participants (83 men; 94 women) were recruited. The median of age was 47 years (IQR = 33-57 years), asymptomatic cases(35 years) are youger than symptomatic(47 years). The types of cases were statistically different among different age groups(&#x03C7;<sup>2</sup>= 14.0671,<italic>P</italic>=0.003).The descriptive analysis of 177 convalescents with SARS-CoV-2 infections were included (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For serology results, 152 were positive and 25 were negative. Only two subjects had international travel history.</p>

<title>Specific Antibodies IgM and IgG Levels</title>
<p>The levels of different antibodies in 177 patients infected SARS-CoV-2 were further described (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As time went by, largely of patients tended to IgG positive and IgM negative. The proportion of IgM positive in infected women was significantly lower than men, but the proportion of IgG positive was similar between different genders. People who aged &#x2265;60 years have higher IgG (94.74&#x0025;)seroprevalence than IgM(10.53&#x0025;), IgG positive percentage of different age groups was statistically difference(<italic>&#x03C7;</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>= 10.8514, <italic>P</italic>=0.013). Asymtomatic was lower than symptomatic for both IgG and IgM to SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence.</p>

<title>Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis of Positive Antibody for IgM</title>
<p>The occurrence of positive IgM antibody was taken as the dependent variable, gender and type were considered as the independent variables (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), female and symptomatic cases as the reference group respectively. Different age groups were dummy variables. The age group younger than 20 years was the reference group. Previous studies have found that gender and age were related to the outcome levels of antibodies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age and type of infection were not related to IgM antibody results. However, after adjustment for infected type and age, men had more than twice the odds of having IgM antibody positive compared with women (OR=2.419, 95&#x0025; CI:[1.232, 4.751]).</p>

<title>Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis of Positive Antibody for IgG</title>
<p>The antibody level of IgG antibody(positive or negative) was taken as the dependent variable, gender and type of infected person as the independent variables (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), female and symptomatic cases were taken as the reference group. Different age groups were dummy variables. The age group younger than 20 years was the control group. While we excluded travel history due to its improper composition ratio. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender and type of infection were not related to IgG positive result. Participants without symptoms were nearly 0.5 times more likely to be seropositive than those with symptoms (OR=0.455, 95&#x0025; CI: [0.220, 0.940]). People aged 60 years and older were nearly 3 times IgG seropositive than those who aged less than 20 years(OR=2.986, 95&#x0025; CI: [1.058, 8.432]).</p>

<title>The Duration of IgM and IgG</title>
<p>Analysis of the 363 serological samples showed that the positive rate of IgG was higher than IgM, and the immune response persistence of IgG was longer than that of IgM antibody, which was consistent with the current research[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. The median duration of IgM and IgG antibodies was 7 months. We observed duration of both antibodies persisted more than 10 months. It suggested that there may be a long-term immune response after infection with SARS-CoV-2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. In order to comprehend the dynamics of antibody response, we took the occurrence of negative antibody as failure, and depicted the survival curve of differential antibodies. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, IgM antibody positive rates declined gradually over time after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. Asymptomatic cases were easier turn out to negative. IgG antibody prevalence declined gradually after the sixth month(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), with duration last more than 10 months. The total positive rate of symptomatic is higher than that of asymptomatic. As well as the long-term duration. The disappearance time of the two specific antibodies still needs further observation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study contributes more essential information for convalescents about the durablity and stability of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Human immune response is usually measured in the blood, and IgG and IgM antibodies are thought as immune memory markers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. We analysed the serological outcomes from 177 convalescents of COVID-19 and risk factors. After adjustment for infected type and age, men had more than twice the odds of having IgM antibody positive compared with women (OR=2.419, 95&#x0025; CI:[1.232, 4.751]). Participants without symptoms were nearly 0.5 times IgG seropositive than those with symptoms (OR=0.455, 95&#x0025; CI: [0.220, 0.940]). Among different age groups between symptomatic cases and asymptomatic cases with statistical difference(&#x03C7;<sup>2</sup>= 14.0671,<italic>P</italic>=0.003). People aged &#x2265; 60 were nearly 3 times IgG seropositive than those who aged &#x003C; 20 years (OR=2.986, 95&#x0025; CI: [1.058, 8.432]). Both IgM and IgG seroprevalence declined gradually over time after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. We also observed seroprevalence of convalescents can persist more than 10 months, the disappearance still needs further observation.</p>
<p>Both IgM and IgG seroprevalence declined gradually over time after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2, with seropositive antibodies lasted more than 10 months. It was demonstrated that response wanes over time of convalescence rather than the sake of repeated donations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Asymptomatic cases were easier turn out to negative. The total positive rate of IgG antibody is higher than that of IgM antibody. The seroprevalence of IgM in infected men was higher than women. Gender differences may affect SARS-CoV-2 immune response outcome[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. When considering subgroups by gender, women are more likely have higher frequency than in men. After analysis of 363 serological samples collected, it was concluded that the positive rate of IgG was significantly higher than that of IgM, and the immune response persistence of IgG was longer than IgM. Meanwhile, we observed duration of specific antibody was last more than 10 months from our data. Previous study reported was 8 months[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Ideally, this study should be based on continuous detection at time points, but in reality it is difficult to carry out continuous systematic sample collection, and not all patients have continuous observation data, which limits the continuous observation of individual antibody response reports. Our data do not yet know whether our individuals sustain low and stable levels after an initial drop in antibody levels, and the inactivation time of specific antibodies generated by natural infection with SARS-CoV-2, which requires further tracking and testing.</p>
<p>Future studies will require large sample sizes of long-term, continuous data on specific immune memory for SARS-CoV-2 to assess its association with protection. They can be conducted with long-term follow-up and detection to investigate factors strongly related to serological levels and antibody dynamics over time, provided deep insight into the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 of convalescents and better guide the development of vaccines and therapeutics.</p>
