<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project generated more than 2.5 petabytes of genomic and clinical data for 33 different cancer types. While the molecular data were generated by means of bioinformatic pipelines, returning computationally ready to use data, the clinical data were mainly manually annotated, without annotation standards. Therefore, some clinical data are not ready to use from a computational point of view. A clear example is represented by drug names, containing both compound and commercial names, spelled in a variety of, not always correct, ways. The main objective of this study is to report the curation of the treatment-related information of the patients enrolled in the TCGA study, to present the data in an easily accessible format and to show some representative analysis aimed at identifying putative molecular markers of response to various cancer therapies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>The manual curation of TCGA treatment response data: the selection of pertinent features and the treatment name harmonization</title>
<p>The TCGA clinical data are organized in dataframes containing clinical features as rows and patients as columns for each of the main 33 tumor type and 5 tumor macro-groups (COADREAD, GBMLGG, KIPAN, STES, LUNG). Refer to the following table for the tumor types present in the TCGA study and their official symbols.</p>
<table-wrap id="utbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="21251941v1_utbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Fore each tumor type the amount of clinical entries available is highly variable, ranging from 634 for UVM samples to 5516 for GBMLGG samples, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig1" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 1:</label>
<caption><p>Number of clinical entries per tumor type.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="21251941v1_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>This variable amount of clinical features can be explained by the presence of several features that are cancer specific (i.e. PAM50 classification for BRCA, Gleason score for PAAD) and by the fashion the data are organized. One example is represented byt the COAD patient <italic>TCGA-A6-2671</italic> which has been subjected to 22 different treatment, creating 22 different entries for drug related data such as: treatment start, end, response and name. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the list and the hierarchical organization of treatment specific information that has been selected for the manual curation, the radiation data will be covered in different work.</p>
<fig id="fig2" position="float" fig-type="figure">

<graphic xlink:href="21251941v1_fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The drug name section represents the main obstacle to the systematic analysis of TCGA drug response data. Indeed this information was manually notated, without following any standardization or formal rule. Thus, a drug could have been annotated either with its compound name, commercial name, symbol or abbreviation, moreover several spelling error can be found. For example the drug Pemetrexed, commercial name Alimta <sup><italic>&#x2122;</italic></sup> has been annotated as Almita and Atima while Fluorouracil was annotated with more than 40 different ways. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the frequency distribution of all the drug names.</p>
<fig id="fig3" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 3:</label>
<caption><p>Amount of synonyms for every treatment.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="21251941v1_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>As a consequence of the drug name harmonization step, treatment information can be now effectively exploited for statistical analysis. Furthermore the cross-talk with other source of drug related information, such as DrugBank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> is now possible. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <italic>supplementary data 1</italic>) shows a network representation of drug-target interactions gathered from DrugBank: We can appreciate how drugs cluster on target similarity.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="21251941v1_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The curation steps described so far allowed the creation of the dataframe (drug therapy, <italic>supplementary data 2</italic> and dataframe header description, <italic>supplementary data 3</italic>) that represent the starting point for treatment response analyses that can performed on the TCGA cohort.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Identification of putative markers of treatment response</title>
<p>In order to identify putative markers of pharmacological treatment response, as proposed in this study, the drug response data required to be further filtered. Only the response to the first, in chronological order, treatment was taken into account; moreover only the most commonly prescribed treatment was taken into consideration leaving us with a cohort of 679 unique patients and 15 unique treatments, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. Finally, the measure of response were collapsed into two categories: Partial and complete response were considered as responders while stable disease and clinical progressive disease were considered non responders. In order to reproduce the following analysis, data in <italic>supplementary data 4</italic> should be used.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Correlation of individual features with drug response</title>
<p>The previously generated treatment response data were, at first, systematically correlated with coding gene expression, miRNA expression, protein abundance and clinical data, independently. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> shows a set of examples of individual feature correlations between three molecular features (miR-10b expression, AGAP21 expression and mTOR phosphorylation in Serine 2448), one clinical feature, (namely histological subtype) and treatment response in 4 different tumor types: CESC, SARC, STES and BRCA, respectively.</p>
<fig id="fig6" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 6:</label>

B) Correlation between AGAP1, mRNA expression and response to docetaxal &#x002B; gemcitabine treatment in SARC. C) Correlation between mTOR phosphorylation, RPPA signal and fluorouracil response in STES. E) Correlation between histological type, clinical feature and cyclophosphamide &#x002B; doxorubicin treatment in BRCA.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="21251941v1_fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>For every tumor type, individual molecular or clinical features have been correlated with the response to the most frequently administered treatment. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> shows an heatmap of the nominal P-values obtained from the systematic correlation between the individual features and the tumor specific treatment response data. Not surprisingly the features tend to organize in clusters that are tumor/treatment specific. The list of all the correlations thresholded at nominal P-value &#x003C; 0.05 can be found in <italic>supplementary data 5</italic>. This analysis allows the identification of individual, putative predictors of response to specific therapies.</p>
<fig id="fig7" position="float" fig-type="figure">

<caption><p>Heatmap summarizing the pvalues of the correlations between molecular or clinical features and the response to the most frequently administered, tumor specific treatment.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="21251941v1_fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Due to the tendency of the molecular features to create response clusters, probably as direct consequence of the intrinsic correlation between genes with similar function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] or belonging to similar biological pathways, a principal component analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] (PCA) was performed to reduce the amount of the individual molecular features to test. PCA was performed for every tumor types on the set aggregated, most variable features between responders and non responders</p>
<p>The resulting principal components (PCs) were then tested for correlation with drug response data and the results, thresholded at nominal P-value &#x003C;0.05 are shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>. In order to extrapolate the biological meaning of the PCs a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] can be performed on the PCA loadings. In <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> an example of follow up analysis on a PC that correlate with fluorouracil response in STES is shown.</p>
<fig id="fig8" position="float" fig-type="figure">

</fig>
<p>These results show that with these data we can identify individual molecular features and biological processes that correlate with treatment response.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Multivariate logistic models to predict treatment response</title>
<p>Due to the binary nature or the collapsed response variable, logistic models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] has been chosen as statistical tool to perform multivariate predictive analysis of response. The logistic models have been build on the combinations of the most strongly response-correlated: 1) molecular features and 2) PCs. In both cases each tumor cohort was split into a training and a test set, the selection of both 1) and 2) as well as the creation of the model was performed on the training set and then validated on the test set. <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> shows the performance of the logistic models on the combined molecular features and PCs on the same graph for direct comparison. The models built on the PCs seem to perform better in the majority of the tested tumor types.</p>
<fig id="fig10" position="float" fig-type="figure">

<graphic xlink:href="21251941v1_fig10.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We also tested the quality of the treatment response data is by means of a logistic penalized regressions, ElasticNet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. This represent the hardest test for the dataset since ElasticNet requires cross-validation for tuning method hence a bigger cohort. Therefore we applied ElasticNet only on the GBMLGG cohort which represent the most abundant one. In <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref> the results of ElasticNet are shown.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The TCGA represent a formidable resource of molecular and clinical data that allowed an unprecedented comprehension of cancer biology. However the use of TCGA data to study mechanisms and markers of response to therapies has been limited due to the form of the drug response data. In this study we demonstrate that after manual curation the data can be exploited at different levels to identify putative markers of response by means of different statistical approaches. Despite the effort in aggregate the response information (aggregation that can be further achieved by grouping treatments by targets), some tumor types show very few data points and this translate into P-values that won&#x2019;t be able to survive the multiple test correction. Nevertheless this represent a potent validation tool for drug response studies due to great amount of tumors analyzed and the unprecedented level of molecular characterization, and the reported analysis represent a fraction of the potential of this dataset.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>Drug and radiation data splitting and data frame creation</title>
<p>The clinical information was organized into two data frames depending on the type of treatment: drug or radiation. This subdivision was necessary to create uniform data frames. Both categories contain information about patient barcode, tumor type of origin and treatment response. The column names of the data frames are preserved from the initial TCGA files (the typo of the field clinical_trail_drug_classification was not corrected to allow intersection with the original data). Two column names have been added: tumor, to facilitate the sub-setting of the data frame by tumor type and treatment_n, since some patients may have been treated with different drugs beside the initial treatment. The rows only containing sample_barcode, treament_n and history_of_neoadjuvant_treatment information were removed from the data frame. Details of the fields contained in both data frames are summarized in <italic>supp data 1</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g">
<title>Drug name correction and harmonization</title>
<p>Drug names present in the drug specific data frame were manually curated in order to correct and harmonize treatment names. Among the most relevant amendment to the drug_name field the change from brand name to generic name, and typo correction. In case of multiple generic names for one drug, the name found in Drugbank was selected, to facilitate the cross-talk between the two databases. This process reduced the number of drug treatments from 859 to 337. The drug name mapping is presented in <italic>supp data 6</italic>.</p>

<title>Statisctical analysis, database creation and plots</title>
<p>The databases have been created by means of custom scripts in BASH and R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], version 3.6.3. Mann-Whitney test has been used to assess the correlations between continuous variables and treatment response. Pearson&#x2019;s Chi-squared test has been used to correlate categoric variables for tables bigger than 2&#x00D7;2. Mosaic plots were generated by means of <italic>vcd</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] R package. Boxplots were generated by means of <italic>ggplot2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] R package. ElasticNet result has been represented by means of <italic>ROCR</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] R package.
