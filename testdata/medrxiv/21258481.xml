<abstract>
<title>Summary</title><p>Severe COVID-19 is linked to both dysfunctional immune response and unrestrained immunopathogenesis, and it remains unclear if T cells also contribute to disease pathology. Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics with mechanistic studies to assess pathogenic T cell functions and inducing signals. We identified highly activated, CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells with increased cytotoxic functions in severe COVID-19. CD16 expression enabled immune complex-mediated, T cell receptor-independent degranulation and cytotoxicity not found in other diseases. CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells from COVID-19 patients promoted microvascular endothelial cell injury and release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Age-dependent generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cytotoxic T cells. The proportion of activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a correlated with clinical outcome of COVID-19, supporting a pathological role of exacerbated cytotoxicity and complement activation in COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in humans causes a diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazawa, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to direct virus-induced injury to the respiratory system and other organs, increasing evidence suggests that the immune response evoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to the pathophysiology of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), particularly during severe disease courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gustine and Jones, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">McKechnie and Blish, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Vabret et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Both, conventional CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T helper cells and particularly CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL), play important roles in the control of respiratory viral infections. Not surprisingly, T cell responses have been discussed to play a protective role in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jacob, 2020</xref>). High numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells have been associated with a milder disease course. While this had been interpreted as a predominantly protective role of T cell responses during COVID-19 (Rydyznski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Moderbacher et al., 2020</xref>), complementary data do not unequivocally support this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mathew et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Peng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Thieme et al., 2020</xref>). The extent of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses could not be directly linked to disease severity, with high T cell numbers not necessarily translating into mild courses of COVID-19. In fact, the number of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells were found to be comparable or even higher in COVID-19 patients displaying severe versus mild courses of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mathew et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Peng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Thieme et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Along this line, flow cytometric analysis of 19 COVID-19 patients revealed a higher state of T cell activation in all T cell compartments (CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, Double negative (DN)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Zenarruzabeitia et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Interstitial T cell infiltration is commonly observed in pathological specimens of COVID-19 pneumonia along with macrophage accumulation in the alveolar space, and it has been hypothesized that T cell infiltrates also contribute to damaging alveolar walls and endothelial cell injury known as lymphocytic endotheliitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazawa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Varga et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>All this argues for a complex relationship between T cell immune responses and disease outcome during COVID-19 beyond a mere quantitative influence of the T cell compartment with additional factors shaping the quality of T cell responses and consequently ensuing pathology as well as disease amelioration. For a better understanding of the disease it is therefore important to identify whether and which T cells have a pathogenic role. In addition, the mechanism by which they are induced and act need to be revealed as studies in this direction are currently lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yan et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we combined single-cell proteomics and transcriptomics with mechanistic studies to reveal alterations in the T cell compartment and their causative signals and functional relevance, which explains important immunopathological features observed in severe COVID-19. Mass cytometry (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA-seq combined with VDJ-seq-based T cell clonotype identification were used to determine COVID-19-as well as severity-specific alterations in the T cell compartment within two cohorts. In addition to the severity-independent formation of highly activated HLA-DR<sup>hi</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>CD137<sup>&#x002B;</sup>Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T Follicular Helper (TFH) -like cells and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in COVID-19, we describe a C3a-driven specific induction of activated CD16 expressing cells in severe COVID-19 patients in the three main T cell compartments. These T cells display increased immune complex-mediated, TCR-independent cytotoxicity causing activation and release of chemokines by lung endothelial cells. This mechanism most likely contributes to the profound organ pathophysiology and endotheliitis observed in autopsy samples of severe COVID-19 patients.</p>

<p>To reveal putative immunopathogenic roles of T cells in severe COVID-19 we performed mass cytometry of whole blood samples from mild and severe COVID-19 patients during the acute and convalescent phase, patients suffering from other acute respiratory infections (Flu-like illness, FLI), patients chronically infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B (HBV) as well as controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We reported previously that T cell numbers were reduced in COVID-19 patients during acute infection compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020</xref>). To further interrogate the T cell space, acquired T cells (CD45<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD19<sup>-</sup>CD15<sup>-</sup>) were pre-gated into CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T helper cells (CD3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, CD8<sup>-</sup>TCRgd<sup>-</sup>), CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CTLs (CD3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup>TCRgd<sup>-</sup>), and TCRgd<sup>&#x002B;</sup> (CD3<sup>-</sup>, CD8<sup>-</sup> TCRgd<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) cells. As expected, samples from HIV patients showed an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio, whereas the proportions of all three main T cell compartments were similar between all other patient groups (mild and severe COVID-19, FLI, HBV) and controls (median levels: T helper cells 63.3-71.5&#x0025;, CTLs 27.2-34.8&#x0025;, TCRgd<sup>&#x002B;</sup> 0.9-2.9&#x0025;). Unsupervised clustering analysis using 29 surface antigens and the proliferation marker Ki67 partitioned the pre-gated T helper cells, CTLs, and TCRgd<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells into 18, 15 and 14 individual cell clusters, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>). A significant proportion of T cells from acutely infected mild and severe COVID-19 patients were clearly separated in UMAP space from those of the other patient groups or controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Samples of COVID-19 patients collected during the first three weeks after symptom onset independent of the severity compared to samples from patients with other infections or controls were characterized by increased proportions of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T helper cell cluster 7 (CD38<sup>hi</sup>HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup>ICOS<sup>&#x002B;</sup>), whereas the abundance of cluster 17 (CD27<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) was lower (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, E). Cluster 7 T cells are characterized by high expression of activation markers such as HLA-DR, CD38, CD137, CD69, and the proliferation marker Ki67. Furthermore, the T cells in this cluster do express CXCR5, ICOS, and PD-1, resembling TFH-like cells. This increase was not seen for patients with other acute respiratory infections (FLI) or chronic viral infections (HIV or HBV). Interestingly, T helper cells in severe COVID-19 patients showed higher proportions of cluster 8 T cells (CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, highly activated Natural Killer T cell (NKT)-like), which in addition to the expression of CD38, HLA-DR, CD137, CD69, Ki67 and CXCR3, were characterized by high levels of CCR6 and CD16. Those T cells belong to the CD62L<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x002B;</sup> central memory metacluster, reflecting a more recent differentiation. In contrast, in patients suffering from chronic HIV or HBV infection we observed a tendency towards a higher proportion of cluster 18 (TIGIT<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD38<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup>). T cells from this cluster were classified as terminally differentiated RA<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells, expressed low levels of CD16, and showed no signs of recent activation such as CD137 expression</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this pattern of activation states was not restricted to the CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell compartment, but also detectable in CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CTLs and TCRgd<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells. Both mild and severe COVID-19 patients displayed increased proportions of cluster 24 T cells (CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) in comparison to the other patient groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, E). Severe COVID-19 was further characterized by increased abundance of cluster 25 T cells (CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, highly activated NKT-like), also expressing high levels of CCR6 and CD16. The existence of a CD3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup>HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell population was confirmed by flow cytometry in a second cohort of COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1A</xref>). In contrast, cluster 30 T cells (PD-1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>TIGIT<sup>&#x002B;</sup>KLRG1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) co-expressing CD137 and several co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1, TIGIT, LAG3) were elevated in samples from patients with other acute respiratory infections (FLI) or HIV infection. In chronic HIV and HBV infection, we observed a tendency towards a higher proportion of cluster 32 cells (LAG3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>TIGIT<sup>&#x002B;</sup>KLRG1<sup>&#x002B;</sup>) containing terminally differentiated CD16 expressing T cells (data not shown).</p>
<p>Time-dependent analysis of the CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell clusters revealed a trend to faster accumulation of the activated CD38<sup>hi</sup>HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup> expressing clusters 7 and 24 during the first week after SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe versus mild COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1B, C). In</xref> contrast, the highly activated CD16 expressing NKT-like CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T clusters appeared only during the second week of infection.</p>
<p>Collectively, our overall findings concerning the identification of circulating highly activated and proliferating T helper cells and CTLs after SARS-CoV-2 infection is in line with recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mathew et al., 2020</xref>; Rydyznski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Moderbacher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stephenson et al., 2021</xref>). However, and strikingly, we uncovered a unique activation and differentiation program in a subset of T cells across all three major T cell compartments (T helper cells, CTL and TCRgd<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells), characterized by CD16 and CCR6 expression in severe COVID-19.</p>

<title>Single-cell transcriptomics reveal shift towards disproportionally high cytotoxic and degranulation potential of T cells in severe COVID-19</title>
<p>To reveal functional information on the COVID-19- and severity-specific T cell clusters, we performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples as well as purified CD38 expressing T cells from acutely infected and convalescent mild and severe COVID-19, as well as FLI, HBV and controls. Cluster analysis of the whole T cell space from PBMC and CD38<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell libraries generated 15 different T cell clusters and one unspecified cell cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, B). To align the CyTOF and scRNA-seq T cell clusters, we applied a feature-based cluster annotation approach. The selected feature list contained genes for all markers analysed in CyTOF measurements plus additional genes such as T cell state-specific transcription markers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). T cell clusters were composed of solely <italic>CD4</italic> expressing T cell clusters 1 to 7, mixed <italic>CD4</italic>, <italic>CD8A</italic>/<italic>B</italic> &#x0026; <italic>TRGC2</italic> expressing T cell clusters 8 and 9, mixed <italic>CD8A</italic>/<italic>B</italic> &#x0026; <italic>TRGC2</italic> expressing T cell clusters 10 to 13 as well as solely <italic>CD8</italic> transcribing T cell clusters 14 &#x0026; 15. Cluster 7, 8 and 10 were characterized by highly activated T cells with high transcription of <italic>CD38</italic> and <italic>HLA-DR</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C). Cluster 7 T cells showed the typical features of activated TFH cells, as in addition to <italic>CD38</italic> and <italic>HLA-DR</italic> genes, they transcribed <italic>ICOS</italic>, <italic>CD40LG</italic>, <italic>PDCD1</italic> (PD-1) and <italic>CXCR5</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Cluster 8 T cells transcribed the highest <italic>MKI67</italic> (Ki67) levels, indicative of the highest proliferative potential (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C). In addition, they expressed <italic>FCGR3A</italic>, the gene encoding for CD16A, which was even more pronounced for cluster 10 T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C). The proportion of T cells belonging to cluster 7, 8 and 10 was higher in COVID-19 patients compared to FLI or HBV patients as well as controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, E). We observed other T cell clusters with <italic>FCGR3A</italic> expression (cluster 9, 11, 12, 13). Only cluster 9 T cells transcribed <italic>SELL</italic> (CD62L) and displayed a central memory phenotype, whereas cluster 11, 12 and 13 T cells displayed a more advanced differentiation profile. Overall, cluster 7 contains TFH-like cells similar to the CyTOF cluster 7, whereas cluster 8, 9 and 10 most likely contain a mixture of highly activated and CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> NKT-like cells with similarities to the CyTOF clusters 8, 24 and 25. Next, we performed a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis across clusters 7, 8, 9 and 10, comparing mild and severe COVID-19 T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, whereas T cells from mild COVID-19 patients showed an enrichment for cellular responses to type I interferon and antiviral defense, we observed a very specific enrichment of genes involved in degranulation in severe COVID-19 T cells. This selective enrichment was validated by a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for genes belonging to the GO terms &#x2018;response to type I interferon&#x2019; and &#x2018;defense response to virus&#x2019;, which were enriched in mild, and for genes belonging to a cytotoxicity signature, which were enriched in severe COVID-19 T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Indeed, several genes known to promote degranulation (<italic>LAMP1</italic>, <italic>STX11</italic>) or exerting cytotoxic potential (<italic>PRF1</italic>, <italic>GZMB</italic>, <italic>GZMH</italic>, <italic>GZMK</italic>) displayed a tendency towards higher expression in severe COVID-19 across clusters 7, 8, 9 &#x0026; 10 T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>&#x002B;S2B) or the whole T cell space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2C</xref>). Importantly, we validated these findings in scRNA-seq data from our second cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3</xref>). Applying the same feature selection-based annotation approach to the second cohort resulted in identification of COVID-19-specific T cell clusters, which consistently aligned to the ones from the first cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3A-D</xref>). Cluster 6 and 7 contained CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells transcribing <italic>ICOS</italic>, <italic>CD40LG</italic>, <italic>PDCD1</italic> and <italic>CXCR5</italic> and thus resembled cluster 7 T cells from cohort 1, although the expression level of <italic>CD38</italic> and <italic>HLA-DR</italic> genes seemed to be lower. Clusters 10 &#x0026; 13 from the second cohort resembled cluster 10 &#x0026; 8 in cohort 1, respectively. Furthermore, GSEA similarly showed increased expression of genes mediating cytotoxicity in severe COVID-19 T cells across these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3E, F</xref>).</p>

<title>CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells from severe COVID-19 patients display CD16-mediated degranulation potential leading to chemokine production by co-cultured primary lung microvascular endothelial cells</title>
<p>CyTOF and scRNA-seq analyses identified two main T cell activation features i) formation of highly activated, proliferating TFH-like CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells and CXCR3 expressing CTLs independent of disease severity, and ii) activated CD16 expressing T cells specific for severe COVID-19. Since TFH cells are known to promote B cell help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Crotty, 2014</xref>) and since we observed a trend for faster formation of activated TFH-like cells in severe COVID-19 patient samples, we tested whether SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses were more pronounced in those patients. Indeed, serum concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, but particular IgG levels were higher in severe COVID-19 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

<p>Next, we investigated the functional properties related to the CD16 expressing CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell clusters. Since CD16 is known to mediate antibody-mediated degranulation of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Moretta et al., 2008</xref>), we tested whether T cells from severe COVID-19 patients display enhanced CD16-dependent degranulation potential. As a surrogate for immune complex-mediated T cell stimulation, we assessed intracellular Granzyme B and cell surface CD107a in PBMCs from mild or severe COVID-19 patients as well as controls after a 6-hour incubation with anti-CD16 antibody or isotype antibody--coated beads (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, D). As predicted by scRNA-seq, samples from severe COVID-19 patients contained significantly more Granzyme B expressing CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells compared to controls. Furthermore, stimulation with anti-CD16 but not isotype-coated beads elicited stronger degranulation (CD107a surface expression) of severe COVID-19 CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells compared to T cells from mild COVID-19 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, control T cells had very low degranulation potential.</p>
<p>One of the most likely implications of CD16 engagement in severe COVID-19 is enhanced T cell degranulation during interaction with endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bagnato and Harari, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Degauque et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, based on findings from autopsies in severe COVID-19, T cell infiltration along with endothelial cell injury known as lymphocytic endotheliitis has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Miyazawa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Varga et al., 2020</xref>). One could envision that immune complexes made of virus particles and antibodies elicit degranulation of CD16 expressing T cells which contributes to endothelial injury. To test this hypothesis, we co-cultured primary lung microvascular endothelial cells with enriched non-naive (CD45RA<sup>&#x002B;/-</sup>, CCR7<sup>-</sup>) CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells from mild or severe COVID-19 as well as control T cells in the presence of anti-CD16 antibody. Subsequently, release of inflammatory mediators was analysed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Anti-CD16-triggered severe COVID-19 T cells elicited enhanced CXCL8 (IL-8) and CCL2 (MCP-1) release by co-cultured endothelial cells. Importantly, chemokines were produced by endothelial cells as we did not observe chemokine release by anti-CD16-triggered T cells cultured alone (data not shown). We also analysed whether non-naive CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells from mild and severe COVID-19 have a greater potential to amplify Concanavalin A (ConA)-mediated endothelial cell activation and loss of endothelial cell barrier function compared to control T cells. T cells from both mild and severe COVID-19 patients showed a higher potential to reduce transendothelial electrical resistance compared to control T cells, but this effect was only significant for T cells from severe COVID-19 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether CD16 expressing T cells are found locally in COVID-19. To study this we made use of a published scRNA-seq data set of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from COVID-19 patients and patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wauters et al., 2021</xref>). Cluster analysis of the T cell space generated 11 clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Whereas most T cell clusters contained <italic>CD38</italic> and <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> transcribing cells, <italic>FCGR3A</italic> expression was more or less confined to cluster 3, 6, 10 and 11 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). The abundance of cluster 3, 10 and 11 was higher in COVID-19 samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Importantly, cluster 10, showing the strongest enrichment in COVID-19 samples, was characterized by the highest <italic>FCGR3A</italic> expression. In addition, T cells belonging to this cluster transcribed nearly all genes of the cytotoxicity signature including <italic>LAMP1</italic> at the highest level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings support our hypothesis of a COVID-19-specific generation and local accumulation of CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, highly cytotoxic T cells, which can induce activation and injury of lung endothelial cells. T cell-induced release of chemoattractants CXCL8 and CCL2 can contribute to increased infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes in COVID-19 pneumonia.</p>

<title><italic>FCGR3A</italic> expressing T cell clones induced during acute severe COVID-19 persist and maintain their increased cytotoxic potential</title>
<p>Knowing that CD16 expressing T cells from severe COVID-19 patients display enhanced cytotoxic properties potentially contributing to organ damage, we analysed whether they persist (in circulation) after clearance of the acute infection. To do so, we obtained VDJ sequence information in addition to the gene expression data of T cells from acute and convalescent samples of mild and severe COVID-19 as well as FLI, HBV and controls, allowing us to study the fate of early expanded T cell clones during convalescence at months 3 to 4 post-symptom onset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> A-E). First, we analysed whether the individual COVID-19 T cell clusters differ in their clonal enrichment. Interestingly, the <italic>FCGR3A</italic> expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific scRNA-seq T cell clusters 8 and 10 (introduced in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) showed a high level of clonal enrichment during acute COVID-19 infection, which was rather low for cluster 7, the cluster containing solely CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> TFH-like cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Consequently, only clones belonging to cluster 8, 9 and 10, composed of mixed <italic>CD4</italic>/<italic>CD8A</italic> or <italic>CD8A</italic>/<italic>TCRgd</italic> T cell clusters, displayed a high degree of persistence with up to 50&#x0025; of the TCR clones being recovered in convalescent samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, clones expanded in the highly proliferating cluster 8 showed a higher persistence in severe COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Following the clone-specific VDJ sequences also allowed us to track in which cluster these clones accumulated during convalescence, in other words, whether they either kept or changed their molecular phenotype as assessed by scRNA-seq (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, D). While the T cells expanded during the acute infection and belonging to the SARS-CoV-2-specific clusters 7, 8 and 10 dropped dramatically during convalescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) the respective T cell clones from clusters 8 and 10 as determined by TCR clonal fate analysis evolved into T cells mainly identified in clusters 11 and 12 which were still characterized by <italic>FCGR3A</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, D). We therefore tested whether the convalescent clusters also maintained their enhanced cytotoxic potential (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Indeed, GSEA revealed increased expression of genes from the cytotoxicity signature among clusters 6, 11 and 12 T cells of COVID-19 patients versus controls, with an evident difference even when comparing severe versus mild COVID-19 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Using the VDJ sequence information allowed us also to define whether the activated <italic>FCGR3A</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell clusters are mainly composed of NKT cells known to show innate immune cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Krovi and Gapin, 2018</xref>). With the the vast majority of iNKT cells expressing an identical TCR&#x03B1; chain (<italic>TRAV10-TRAJ18</italic>) paired to a restricted set of TCR&#x03B2; chains (<italic>TRBV25</italic>), we determined the proportion of <italic>TRAV10-TRAJ18-TRBV25</italic> pairing T cell clones across all T cell clusters. The median proportion of T cells expressing the TCR alpha-beta pair and thus resembling iNKT cells was 4.7&#x0025;. Apart from cluster 10, we did not observe a major iNKT cell enrichment in the described COVID-19 T cell clusters (C7 &#x003D; 3.73&#x0025;, C8 &#x003D; 6.52&#x0025;, C9 &#x003D; 2.12&#x0025;, C10 &#x003D; 13.46&#x0025;). However, this shows that although the proportion of TRAV<italic>10-TRAJ18-TRBV25</italic> pairing T cell clones was higher in cluster 10, most clones expressed other alpha and beta chain genes and thus do not resemble iNKT cells.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we performed CyTOF analysis of samples during COVID-19 convalescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Similar to the scRNAseq findings, we observed alterations in T cell cluster abundances during convalescence. For CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, we observed a strong increase in T cell proportions for cluster 29, which belongs to the effector memory meta cluster and is characterized by PD-1, TIGIT as well as CD137 expression. In line with the scRNA-seq data for which we detected a decline of the acutely expanded T cell clusters, proportions of highly activated (clusters 7 and 24) and CD16 expressing NKT-like (clusters 8 and 25) CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> clusters decreased in the convalescent phase. However, CD16 expressing T cells did not disappear. In the CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell compartment, we observed an increase in the CD16 expressing late differentiated TEMRA cluster 18, which was more pronounced in severe COVID-19 patients. Similarly, proportions of T cells belonging to the CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD16 expressing TEMRA cluster 32 were higher in the convalescent phase.</p>
<p>Thus, in summary, CD16 expressing CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in particular of severe COVID-19 patients persist during convalescence, adopt a more differentiated, CD62L-negative phenotype but maintain their high cytotoxic potential.</p>

<title>Age-dependent reinforcement of C3a generation promotes differentiation of CD16 expressing highly cytotoxic T cells</title>
<p>We next elucidated the mechanisms leading to accumulation of activated CD16 expressing highly cytotoxic T cells in severe COVID-19.</p>
<p>Since mortality and severe morbidity in COVID-19 disproportionately affects those of advanced age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nanda et al., 2020</xref>), we investigated whether formation of CD16 expressing T cells is associated with increased age. We utilized flow cytometry data available from our recently published control cohorts, in which we assessed age- and sex-dependent changes of peripheral blood immune cell populations in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kverneland et al., 2016</xref>). Also blood samples from controls contain some CD16 expressing CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, yet at very low proportions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), which is in line with the here-reported findings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>&#x002B;S1). Especially for CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, we detected significantly higher proportions of CD16 expressing cells in samples from older individuals, supporting our hypothesis of an age-dependent increase.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we sought to identify signals eliciting CD16 expression on T cells. A key feature of severe COVID-19 is increased complement generation and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carvelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sinkovits et al., 2021</xref>). The complement system is an integral part of the innate immune defense involved in opsonization, chemotaxis and pathogen lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Noris and Remuzzi, 2013</xref>). Apart from these well-known complement activities, it has become clear that its effector functions also extend to an instruction of the adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lubbers et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, complement enhances T cell activation as T cells are known to express receptors for C3a and C3b and react to triggering these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arbore et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hess and Kemper, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">West et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To corroborate a potential link between aging and an increase in complement activity, we analyzed the correlation of the complement component complement factor D (CFD) with age in the generation Scotland study (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Messner et al., 2020</xref>)), which revealed a clear age-dependent increase of CFD. We then extended these findings to COVID-19 patients included in our CyTOF analysis and showed that particularly severe COVID-19 at early time points were characterized by significantly elevated CFD plasma concentrations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel).</p>
<p>CFD is a serine protease that catalyses an important step in the formation of the active C3 convertase of the alternative pathway also known as spontaneous &#x201C;tick-over&#x201D; mechanism of complement activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Noris and Remuzzi, 2013</xref>). Thus, higher CFD expression levels result in higher levels of C3a. Indeed, C3a plasma levels detected in severe COVID-19 patients during the first three weeks after symptom onset exceeded C3a levels detected in the plasma of mild COVID-19, or other acute respiratory infections (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, middle panel). C5a levels peaked in weak three post onset of symptoms but did not reach significance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, right panel). We next assessed whether T cells show elevated binding potential for C3a in COVID-19. Both, CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells from COVID-19 patients regardless of disease severity displayed higher C3a binding potential than cells from controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Finally, plasma C3a levels in COVID-19 patients measured at week 2 post-symptom onset correlated with proportions of COVID-19-specific activated CD16 expressing CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CyTOF clusters (cluster 8&#x002B;25) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether there is a direct link between plasma / serum protein components and differentiation of activated CD16 expressing T cells, we stimulated enriched CD3<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells from healthy unexposed controls with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies in the presence of recombinant IL-2 and serum from mild or severe COVID-19 patients or control AB serum. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5F</xref>, addition of serum from severe COVID-19 patients resulted in a 10- and 20-fold increase of CD16 expressing CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, respectively, which was significantly higher compared to the increase observed when adding serum from mild COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, addition of recombinant C3a to cells stimulated in the presence of control AB serum enhanced formation of CD16 expressing CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic>-generated T cells did not only phenotypically resemble the ones identified in our CyTOF analyses but also shared functional properties as T cells stimulated in the presence of serum from severe COVID-19 patients displayed a higher degranulation potential (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we tested whether C3a is responsible for the altered T cell differentiation potential of serum samples from severe COVID-19 patients. Indeed, neutralisation of C3a resulted in reduction of CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in most T cell differentiation cultures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, complement split products such as C3a produced at high levels in severe COVID-19 generate an inflammatory milieu which promotes differentiation of CD16 expressing, highly cytotoxic T cells.</p>

<title>Proportion of activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and complement protein expression determines outcome of COVID-19</title>
<p>Revealing a connection between the complement system and differentiation of activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in severe COVID-19, we investigated their relation to patient outcome in COVID-19.</p>
<p>We first analysed whether proportions of activated CD16 expressing T cells were higher in severe COVID-19 patients who died during follow-up in both study cohorts. In order to define an objective way to select the sum of all activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> TCRab<sup>&#x002B;</sup> clusters of our CyTOF data set (cohort 1), we computed an activation value for each cluster in the TCRab<sup>&#x002B;</sup> space, defined as the mean of the average z-scored expression of activation markers (CD25, HLA-DR, CD38, CD137, CD69, and Ki67). Then, clusters with an activation value higher than the average, and with an average z-scored CD16 expression higher than 1, were considered activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> TCRab<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell clusters (CyTOF cluster: C8 &#x003D; CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> central memory highly activated NKT-like, C12 &#x003D; CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> effector memory highly activated NKT-like, C25 &#x003D; CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> central memory highly activated NKT-like). We observed a trend to higher percentages of activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> TCRab<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells among all CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells in samples from severe COVID-19 patients who deceased(non-survivor) compared to those who survived (survivor) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, second left panel). Furthermore, proportions of CD3<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup>HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells as measured in cohort 2 by multicolor flow cytometry also showed a trend to be higher in severe COVID-19 patients who deceased during follow-up (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, middle panel).</p>

<p>In addition, we tested whether the proportion of activated <italic>FCGR3A</italic> expressing scRNAseq clusters correlates with survival of severe COVID-19 patients. We applied a similar two-step strategy to select all activated <italic>FCGR3A</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> TCRab<sup>&#x002B;</sup> clusters as described for the CyTOF data. All T cell clusters which showed an above mean activation value, calculated as mean z-score of activation markers as defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3B</xref>, and clusters which showed <italic>FCGR3A</italic> transcription were selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3B</xref>, cluster 10, 13 and 18). Again, the percentage of T cells belonging to activated <italic>FCGR3A</italic><sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell clusters showed a trend to be higher in severe COVID-19 patients who deceased (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, right panel). Together, this difference was significant, when analysed across methods (CyTOF, MCFC, scRNAseq) and cohorts (p&#x003D;0.011, Fisher&#x2019;s method, df&#x003D;6)</p>
<p>Next, we tested in a larger cohort whether expression of complement proteins upstream of C3a generation (C1QA, C1QB, C1QC, C1R, C1S, C2, C3, C4, C4A, C4B, C4BPA. C4BPB, CFB, CFD, CFH, CFI, MASP1, MASP2, MBL2) is associated with patient disease course and outcome. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6B</xref>, expression levels of positive regulators of the classical and alternative pathway such as C1QA, C1QB, C1QC, C1R, and CFD were higher in plasma samples of severe compared to mild COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). We also analysed the complement protein expression level according to subsequent worsening of disease severity, i.e., increase of WHO scale. This also revealed higher expression of C1R and CFD in samples from patients who showed an increase in WHO scale during follow-up, whereas the expression of CFI, which inhibits the classical and lectin-dependent complement pathway was lower in samples from patients with subsequent disease progression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Finally, amounts of C1QA, C1QB, C1QC and CFD were not only higher in severe COVID-19 but also determined their survival (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether these data further support the pathological role of complement-mediated formation of activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells during severe COVID-19.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>T cells play an important role in the control of acute respiratory infections. However, excessive T cell activation and altered phenotypes can contribute to infection-associated organ damage. Early after the first reports on immune profiles of COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sette and Crotty, 2021</xref>) discussions on their putative role in immune protection versus pathology started. Although evidence for an association of increased T cell activation with disease severity during the acute phase was emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mathew et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Peng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Thieme et al., 2020</xref>), functional consequences and causal mechanisms remain poorly studied. In our study, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection - in contrast to other acute and chronic infections - promotes formation of highly activated and proliferating HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>CD137<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD69<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T helper cells and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells independent of disease severity, although this response occurred faster in severe COVID-19 patients. More importantly, primarily in severe COVID-19 patients, we detected differentiation of activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, which showed an increased immune complex-mediated cytotoxic potential causing activation of lung microvascular endothelial cells. Expanded clones within the CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell compartment persisted and maintained their high cytotoxic potential. Furthermore, our functional investigations identified complement factors and especially C3a as a driving signal for the differentiation of the altered activated T cell phenotype. In addition, proportions of activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and plasma complement protein expression levels determined outcome of severe COVID-19 patients. Thus, interaction of age-related increased production of complement components and SARS-CoV-2-triggered complement activation creates an inflammatory milieu which drives differentiation of T cells with high immunopathogenic potential.</p>
<p>A balanced T cell activation regarding magnitude and functional properties is decisive for the course of infection. Formation of CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) during primary infection is known to play an important protective role to restrain viral spread upon secondary influenza infections. Yet, enhanced accumulation of Trm cells in an imbalanced environment such as during aging can support excessive inflammation leading to organ damage and impaired repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goplen et al., 2020</xref>). In COVID-19, large numbers of such Trm-like CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells have been identified in the airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liao et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Blood samples acquired during the acute phase of severe COVID-19, contain high numbers of HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup> in both CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mathew et al., 2020</xref>; Rydyznski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Moderbacher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stephenson et al., 2021</xref>), a finding that we corroborated by CyTOF analysis. Most intriguing, we identified an elevated and activated T cell population expressing CD16 across the three major T cell compartments, namely CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> TCRab<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, and TCRgd<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells. These T cells show increased TCR-independent pathogenic potential. Thus, in severe COVID-19 T cell activation and functionality is altered due to an imbalanced, aged, and C3a-rich environment.</p>
<p>The activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells enriched in severe COVID-19 expressed high levels of chemokine receptors such as CXCR3 and CCR6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). This clearly distinguished them from the other CD16<sup>lo</sup> T cell clusters e.g. cluster 18 and promoting migration into the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Oja et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Shanmugasundaram et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, BAL samples from COVD-19 compared to control pneumonia showed an enrichment of <italic>FCGR3A<sup>&#x002B;</sup></italic> T cells with high cytotoxic and degranulation potential (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G-J</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether the activated CD16 expressing CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells are SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific remains unclear. At least for the <italic>ex vivo</italic>-determined HLA-DR<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>Ki67<sup>&#x002B;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, a positive correlation with SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells has been described (Rydyznski <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Moderbacher et al., 2020</xref>). However, the generation of CD16 expressing T cells can be also driven by bystander activation and/or homeostatic proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mathew et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, antigen specificity for the here-described pathogenic T cells might not play a dominant role, as these cells elicited their excessive cytotoxic properties upon triggering of CD16 rather than peptide recognition.</p>
<p>In line with our findings, a very high proportion of T cells from acute COVID-19 patients express cytotoxic molecules such as Perforin and Granzyme B, with samples of severe patients displaying the highest expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Shuwa et al., 2021</xref>). The increased cytotoxic profile persisted for up to six months and was associated with poorer recovery. CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells identified here in severe COVID-19 did not only express higher levels of <italic>PRF1</italic> and <italic>GZMB</italic> but also <italic>LAMP1</italic> and <italic>STX11</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2B</xref>), which explains their increased general degranulation potential (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Spessott et al., 2017</xref>). So far, CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells with CD16-dependent cytotoxic properties have been described mainly in patients with chronic infections or inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bj&#x00F6;rkstr&#x00F6;m et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cl&#x00E9;menceau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jacquemont et al., 2020</xref>). In these conditions, CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells displayed a more differentiated phenotype like the one adopted during COVID-19 convalescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, D &#x0026; F). Formation of activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells during acute infections has not been described before. Furthermore, we are the first to identify upstream signals leading to CD16 expression on T cells. In acute COVID-19, we also identified elevated transcription of various granzyme genes including <italic>Granzyme K</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2B</xref>). Interestingly, increased numbers of Granzyme K expressing effector memory T cells have been observed in blood samples of older individuals and these T cells were shown to augment cytokine and chemokine production by fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mogilenko et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, it was shown that extracellular Granzyme K proteolytically activates Protease-activated receptor-1 leading to increased release of IL-6 and CCL2 (MCP-1) by endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). Particularly in severe COVID-19, we demonstrated that T cells also induce CCL2 (MCP-1) by co-culture with primary lung endothelial cells upon anti-CD16 mAb-mediated degranulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). We also observed a higher production of CXCL8 by endothelial cells co-cultured with anti-CD16-stimulated CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells from severe COVID-19 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). This establishes a general link between immune complex triggering of local CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells and endothelial cell-mediated release of monocyte and neutrophil chemoattractants, a hallmark of severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rendeiro et al., 2021</xref>). While CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells had been described before, they have not been linked to an acute infection such as severe COVID-19 and potential upstream signals inducing this molecular phenotype remained unclear. Notably, patients suffering from severe COVID-19 have been reported to display high levels of spike-reactive IgG with significantly reduced Fc fucosylation. This change in the Fc glycosylation pattern increases binding affinity to CD16, leading to increased CD16-mediated effector function and degranulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ferrara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vivier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Willianne et al., 2021</xref>). As such, the distinct serological profile observed in severe COVID-19 with afucosylated, spike-directed IgG, and an inherently increased inflammatory capacity could further enhance the pathogenic potential of CD16 expressing T cells.</p>
<p>In a search for important environmental signals driving differentiation of activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells, we detected a positive correlation between high serum C3a levels and proportions of CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). In line with our findings, it has been reported that serum C3 hyperactivation is a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sinkovits et al., 2021</xref>), yet widespread complement activation and generation of C3a has also been described locally in severe COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). Disease-promoting activity of the complement system was observed for other corona viruses, as SARS-CoV infection caused less systemic inflammatory response and lung injury in C3 knock-out as compared to wild type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gralinski et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung epithelial cells induces transcription of complement genes leading to generation of activated C3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, signalling via complement receptors such as C3AR1 and cell-autonomous complosome in human T cells enhances induction of CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> Th1 responses and cytotoxic function of CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arbore et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that increased C3a generation in severe COVID-19 patients promotes differentiation of CD16 expressing, highly cytotoxic CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-H</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, targeting distal complement effects by receptor blockade in a humanized preclinical model of SARS-CoV-2 infection prevented acute lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carvelli et al., 2020</xref>). Results from first clinical trials on complement inhibition in COVID-19 also showed promising effects resulting in reduced inflammation and faster normalization of neutrophil and lymphocyte counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mastellos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Polycarpou et al., 2020</xref>). In this context, C3 inhibition enabled a broader and better therapeutic potential as compared to C5 neutralisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mastellos et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Limitations of the study and future directions</title>
<p>The relatively low number of matched acute and convalescent samples for scRNA-seq analysis limited the comparisons regarding differences in clonal persistence and phenotype between mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Thus, larger studies are needed to confirm the observed increased persistence of late differentiated, CD16 expressing, highly cytotoxic CTLs upon an acute severe disease course. Also, the limited number of convalescent samples did not allow us to perform correlations with patient recovery. Here, our major focus was to reveal immunopathogenic functions of severity-associated T cell populations during acute COVID-19 and to identify driving signals.</p>
<p>In this context, it will be of great interest to see whether application of the C3 inhibitor AMY-101 in COVID-19 patients with ARDS will ameliorate differentiation of CD16 expressing, cytotoxic T cells and thus endothelial cell injury and lymphocytic endotheliitis.</p>
<p>Taken together, particularly severe COVID-19 leads to an elevation of activated CD16<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells that link the elevated complement cascade via TCR-independent cytotoxic T cell functionality to endothelial damage and patient survival, thereby establishing a novel immunopathological link between the innate immune system, the adaptive immune compartment, and endothelial injury, which might constitute an important molecular axis explaining the vast spectrum of organ damage observed in COVID-19.</p>

<p>T cells were identified based on expression of CD3 and CD45, but exclusion of CD19<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and CD15<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells. Pregating on CD8<sup>-</sup>TCRgd<sup>-</sup>, CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup>TCRgd<sup>-</sup> and TCRgd<sup>&#x002B;</sup> cells was used to define CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup>, CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> and TCRgd<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells. Each T cell compartment was then clustered based on the expression of 30 markers: CD62L, CD45RO, CD28, CD27, CD226, ICOS, PD-1, LAG3, TIGIT, CD96, CD25, CD56, HLA-DR, CD38, CD137, CD69, Ki67, CXCR3, CXCR5, CCR6, CRTH2, KLRB1, KLRG1, KLRF1, CD95, CD10, CD16, CD34, CD123, CD11c, CD21, CD14, IgM, and IgD The batch-normalized CyTOF values (described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020</xref>)) were first transformed with the inverse hyperbolic sine function (asinh) and then z-score normalised per marker across all samples. We then clustered each T cell compartment excluding convalescent COVID-19 samples using Phenograph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Levine et al., 2015</xref>) with 30 nearest neighbours (k &#x003D; 30). We originally found 50 clusters, which were annotated based on the average z-score transformed CyTOF expression of the markers in each cluster. Six clusters were merged in pairs, as each pair differed in one marker (KLRB1, CD11c, and CD21, respectively) resulting in 47 clusters. Cells from the convalescent samples were classified into the clusters previously found, via k-nearest neighbour (in Euclidean distance) using the knn function from &#x201C;class&#x201D; R package. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4</xref>). UMAPs were calculated across all acute and convalescent samples with the markers mentioned above excluding CD21, CD14, IgM, and IgD, using the R package &#x201C;uwot&#x201D; (arXiv:1802.03426 [stat.ML]), n_neighbors &#x003D; 30, spread &#x003D; 1, min_dist &#x003D; 0.5, based on Euclidean distance).</p>
<p>The frequency of each cluster was calculated as the percentage of cells in each cluster for each patient and for each T cell compartment. Statistical testing for the difference in the frequency of each cluster was calculated with the adjusted Dunn&#x2019;s post-hoc test (Benjamini-Hochberg) for clusters with significant Kruskal-Wallis test (adjusted p-value (Benjamini-Hochberg) &#x003C; 0.05). For the non-weekly analysis, we considered the sample with the highest white blood cells (WBC) counts per patient. Similarly, for the weekly analysis, only the sample with highest WBC counts per week was included, and the repeated samples in the same week were excluded from the analysis.</p>

To this end, Blaer1 cells were labelled for 30 min at 4&#x00B0;C with 50&#x00B5;g/mL Daratumumab. T cells and Blaer1 cells were incubated in a humidified incubator (37&#x00B0;C, 5&#x0025; C0<sub>2</sub>) for 6h in the presence of 1x Brefeldin A (eBioscienceTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and 1x Monensin (Biolegend, USA). LAMP1-directed antibody (CD107a-APC, clone H4A3, final dilution 1:40) was added to the culture for the whole incubation period. Prior to 6h incubation, cells were centrifuged for 1 min at 350 rcf. Subsequently to 6h incubation, cells were subjected to surface and intracellular staining. Fc receptor-mediated unspecific binding of antibodies was blocked by preincubation with human TruStain FcX Fc receptor blocking solution (Biolegend, USA) for 10 min at 4&#x00B0;C. TrueStain FCX is furthermore added to the respective staining cocktails. Subsequently, cells were stained for CD3 PE (clone UCHT1, Biolegend), CD4 APC/Fire 750 (clone RPT-A4, Biolegend), CD8 BV605 (clone RPA-T8, Biolegend) and CD16 FITC (clone 3G8, Biolegend). The fixable viability dye (ZombieRed, Biolegend) was incorporated in the surface staining mix. Surface epitope staining was performed in DPBS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), 2mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA, 0,5&#x0025;BSA (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Cells were fixed for 20 min at 4&#x00B0;C with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences, USA) and intracellularly stained for 30 min at 4&#x00B0;C Perforin PEcy7 (clone dG9, Biolegend, USA), IFN&#x03B3; BV785 (clone 4S.B3, Biolegend, USA) for 30 min at 4 C&#x00B0;. Intracellular staining was performed in 1x Perm/Wash permeabilization buffer (BD Biosciences, USA).</p>

<title>Quantification of cytokines, chemokines &#x0026; complement split products</title>
<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8&#x003D;CXCL8), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1&#x003D;CCL2) levels of cell culture supernatants were determined using a Milliplex MAP human cytokine/chemokine magnetic bead panel kit (Merck Millipore, USA, HCYTOMAG-60k). The assay was performed overnight with half of the volume according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The median fluorescent intensities were quantified on a Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA) and the results were calculated using Bio-Plex-Manager 6.1 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA).</p>
<p>Concentrations of the C3a and C5a activation products were measured in EDTA plasma from patients using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) kits (HK354 (C3a) at a 1:1000 dilution, HK349 (C5a) at a 1:4 dilution, Hycult Biotech, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s protocols.</p>

<title>Plasma / serum proteomics</title>
<p>Proteomics was conducted using a recently developed platform technology for plasma and serum proteomics. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Demichev et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Messner et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, plasma and serum samples were prepared for mass spectrometry through denaturan, reduction, alkylation and tryptic digestion in 96 well plates using liquid handling robotics, and cleaned using solid phase microextraction. The samples were separated using high-flow rate reversed phase liquid chromatography with an 1290 Infinity II LC System (Agilent Technologies, USA), and data acquired using a Triple TOF 6600 Hybrid mass spectrometer (Sciex Ltd, USA) running SWATH MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gillet et al., 2012</xref>). Data was processed using DIA-NN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Demichev et al., 2020b</xref>), and post-normalized to control batch effects using information obtained from the repeated measurement of quality control samples.</p>
