<title>Abstract</title>
<p>COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the highly infectious coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that is engaging worldwide scientific research to find a timely and effective eradication strategy. Great efforts have been put into anti-COVID-19 vaccine generation in an effort to protect the world population and block SARS-CoV-2 spread. To validate the protective efficacy of the vaccination campaign and effectively control the pandemy, it is necessary to quantify the neutralizing antibodies induction by vaccination, since they have been established to be a correlate of protection. In this work a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay, based on a replication incompetent lentivirus expressing an adapted form of CoV-2 S protein and an ACE2/TMPRSS2 stably expressing cell line, have been minimized in term of protocol steps without loss of accuracy. The goal of the present simplified neutralization system is to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign by means of an easy and accessible approach to be performed in any medical laboratory, maintaining the sensitivity and quantitative reliability of classical serum neutralization assays. Further this assay can be easily adapted to different coronaviruses variants by simply modifying the pseudotyping vector.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Coronaviruses, belonging to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales, are positive-strand RNA viruses with a genome length comprised between 26 and 32 Kbp. Several mammalian and avian species can be infected by coronavirus and most of the time causing respiratory and/or intestinal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HKU1, have long been recognized as major causes of the common cold and are endemic in the human population. Two recent HCoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively, causing life-threatening disease in humans. A previously unknown coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, responsible for a pandemic infection, known as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and causing a large number of deaths people worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Despite a huge research effort has been made, COVID-19 remains a complex disease showing pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical heterogeneous features difficult to understand. A variety of approaches have been employed to develop prophylactic and therapeutic measures, including whole inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines, RNA-based vaccines, viral vectored vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], monoclonal neutralizing antibodies and fusion inhibitors, most of which were designed to target the CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. CoV-2 S, forming homotrimers structures on viral surface, mediates virus entry to the host cell. S mature structure is formed by S1 and S2 functional subunits: S1 interacts with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor, while S2 mediates the viral envelope fusion with the host cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. During S1-ACE2 interaction, the host cell surface Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2), located next to ACE2 receptor, cleaves the S2 subunit at the S2&#x2019; amino terminal portion (815&#x2193;816aa; SKR&#x2193;SFI), inducing the fusion peptide hydrophobic domains exposure and the subsequent viral envelope fusion with the host cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Due to its high infectivity and pathogenicity, CoV-2 needs to be handled in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) specific facilities (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/lab-biosafety-guidelines.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/lab-biosafety-guidelines.html</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], which limits the development of anti-viral measures as well as basic and applied studies on the interaction between host cells and CoV2 and viral attachment and entry mediated by the S protein. To avoid dealing with infectious CoV2, several safe, biosafety level 2 (BSL2) pseudovirus-based systems have been developed mainly based on vescicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] or retrovirus (RV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] vector pseudotyped with CoV-2 S. Although both of them have been shown to be sensitive and reliable, they suffer to be farraginous, time consuming and expensive in procedural terms. In the present work, a 4 steps simplified procedure of CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay was established.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cells</title>
<p>Human Embryo Kidney (HEK) 293T (ATCC: CRL-11268) cells were cultured in Eagle&#x2019;s Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 1mM of Sodium Pyruvate (Gibco), 2 mM of L-glutamine (Gibco), 100 IU/mL of penicillin (Gibco), 100&#x03BC;g/mL of streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Milano, Italy), and 0.25&#x03BC;g/mL of amphotericin B (Gibco); called complete EMEM] supplemented with 10&#x0025; Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Gibco), and were incubated at 37 &#x00B0;C and 5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator.</p>
<p>Stably transfected HEK/S-&#x0394;RS-HA/Puro (HEK/S) and HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cells were obtained transfecting cells with pLV-CMV-(S-&#x0394;RS-HA)-IRES-Puro-WPRE or pEF1&#x03B1;-ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro vectors, respectively. Briefly, sub-confluent HEK 293T cells were detached from a T75cm<sup>2</sup> flask, counted and electroporated with 20 &#x00B5;g of pLV-CMV-(S-&#x0394;RS-HA)-IRES-Puro-WPRE or pEF1&#x03B1;-ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro vectors in 600 &#x00B5;L of DMEM high glucose (Euroclone) without serum at 186V, 1500&#x00B5;F in Gene Pulser XCell (Biorad, Milano, Italy).</p>
<p>Electroporated cells were then transferred to new 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks and fed with complete EMEM with 10&#x0025; FBS. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, the medium was changed with fresh complete EMEM with 10&#x0025; FBS complemented with 2 &#x00B5;g/ml of puromycin (Millipore Merck Life Science, Milano, Italy). Cells were kept in culture until resistant colonies appeared. Cells were split for more than 40 passages and tested for S or ACE2 expression.</p>

<title>Transient Transfection and syncytia formation</title>
<p>HEK 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with pLV-CMV-(S-&#x0394;RS-HA)-IRES-Puro-WPRE, pEF1&#x03B1;-ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro and pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) vectors, with same molar ration (1:1:1), using polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent (Polysciences, Inc. Warrington, Pennsylvania, USA). Briefly, cells were seeded at 5&#x00D7;10<sup>5</sup>cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 &#x00B0;C/5&#x0025; CO2. Cells were then incubated for 6 hours with a transfection mix (1 ml) containing 3&#x03BC;g of plasmids DNA and PEI (ratio 1:2.5 DNA-PEI) in complete DMEM (Dulbecco&#x2019;s Modified Essential Medium (DMEM) high glucose (Euroclone) completed with 50 &#x03BC;g/ml of Gentamicine (Merk)) without serum. After incubation, the transfection mix was replaced by fresh complete EMEM and incubated for 24 hours at 37&#x00B0;C, 5&#x0025; CO2. HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cells were transiently co-transfected with pLV-CMV-(S-&#x0394;RS-HA)-IRES-Puro-WPRE and pEGFP-C1 as before. Alternatively, HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cells were also co-cultivated (1:2 ratio) with HEK 293T cells transiently transfected with pLV-CMV-(S-&#x0394;RS-HA)-IRES-Puro-WPRE and pEGFP-C1. Twenty-four hours post co-cultivation, syncytia were observed by inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss-Axiovert-S100) and pictures were acquired by digital camera (Zeiss-Axiocam-MRC). HEK/S-&#x0394;RS-HA/Puro and HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cells were also co-cultivated as before to generate syncytia.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Western Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Protein cell extracts were obtained from pLV-CMV-(S-&#x0394;RS-HA)-IRES-Puro-WPRE, and pEGFP-C1 transfected HEK293T cells by adding 100&#x03BC;L of cell extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,150 mM NaCl, and 1&#x0025; NP-40; pH 8). After BCA total protein quantification (Pierce&#x2122; BCA Protein Assay kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), cell extracts containing various amount of total protein were electrophoresed through 10&#x0025; SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to a nylon membrane by electroblotting, and the membrane was incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody anti-HA tag (G036, Abm Inc., Vancouver, Canada) diluted 1:10,000. After washing, the membrane was incubated with a rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody labelled with horseradish peroxidase, diluted 1:15,000 (A9044, Sigma-Aldrich) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Clarity Max Western ECL substrate, Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA).</p>

<title>Pseudovirions reconstitution</title>
<p>For reconstituting CoV-2 S pseudovirus, HEK 293T cells were transfected, in T175 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks, with 25 &#x03BC;g of pLV-EF1&#x03B1;-(turboGFP-Luc2)-WPRE transfer vector, 15 &#x03BC;g of p8.74 packaging vector, 13 &#x03BC;g of pLV-CMV-(S-&#x0394;RS-HA)-IRES-Puro-WPRE pseudotyping vector (although this is a transfer vector, it can work as a pseudotyping vector too) and 5&#x03BC;g of pREV (58 &#x03BC;g of total DNA), were diluted in 3 mL of complete DMEM (Euroclone) without serum and 145 &#x03BC;L of PEI (Polysciences, Inc.) (1 mg/mL in PBS) (ratio 1:2.5 DNA-PEI). After at least 15 minuts incubation at room temperature, 4x volumes of complete DMEM without serum were added and the transfection solution and transferred to the cell monolayer. After 6 hours of incubation at 37&#x00B0;C/5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub>, in a humidified incubator, the transfection mixture was replaced with 25 mL of fresh complete EMEM supplemented with 10&#x0025; FBS and incubated for 48 hours at 37 &#x00B0;C/5&#x0025; CO<sub>2</sub>. The flask was then frozen-thawed at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C, Transfected Cells Supernatant (TCS) containing S Pseudovirus was clarified via centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 5 minutes at 4&#x00B0;C, filtered through a 0.45 &#x03BC;m filter (Millipore), aliquoted, tittered by limited dilution and stored at &#x2212;80 &#x00B0;C.</p>
<p>ACE2/TMPRSS2 pseudovirus was prepared as described above by simply substituting pLV-CMV-(S-&#x0394;RS-HA)-IRES-Puro-WPRE with pEF1&#x03B1;-ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro, again, although this is a transfer vector, it can work as a pseudotyping vector too.</p>

<title>Seroneutralization assay</title>
<p>25&#x00B5;L of complete EMEM with 10&#x0025; of FBS were added to each well of a 96 wells opaque wall, clear flat bottom white microplate (Greiner bio one) and 25 &#x00B5;L of each serum were added to the first line of wells (<bold><xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref></bold>). 25&#x00B5;L of S pseudovirus preparation (described in Pseudovirions reconstitution section above) diluted in complete EMEM with 10&#x0025; of FBS (corresponding to &#x223C;10<sup>4</sup> Relative Luciferase Units (RLUs); &#x223C;3-5&#x00B5;L of the initial preparation) were added to each well and left to incubate at room temperature for 1.5 hour. Final volume for each well went up to 50&#x00B5;L, therefore the sera dilution was doubled, 1:4-1:8-1:16-1:32-1:64-1:128-1:256-1:512. Next, 50&#x00B5;L of complete EMEM with 10&#x0025; FBS, containing 10<sup>4</sup> HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cells wear added to each well and left for 60 hours at 37 &#x00B0;C/5&#x0025; CO<sub>2.</sub></p>
<p>Plates were read by adding 25&#x00B5;L of complete EMEM containing Luciferine to each well just before the reading of the microplate to the Luminometer (Victor, Perkin Elmer). Since the plate has a transparent bottom, a dark film layer should be applied for reading. A negative control was established without serum, which was substituted with complete medium. The RLUs were compared and normalized to those derived from wells where pseudovirus was added in the absence of sera (100&#x0025;). Neutralization Titer 50 (NT50) was expressed as the maximal dilution of the sera where the reduction of the signal is &#x2265;50&#x0025;. Note of worthy, the titer has to be multiplied per 40 because the initial volume of the sera tested is 0,025mL and it has to be normalized to 1mL.</p>

<title>Generation of a sensitive target cell line simultaneously expressing ACE2 and TMPRRS2</title>
<p>Since ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are the main restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) attachment and penetration into the host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], a cell line simultaneously expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was generated. For this purpose, a tricistronic expression cassette was constructed. Human ACE2 ORF (GeneBank accession number: NM_021804.3), provided of a strong Kozak&#x2019;s sequence to the 5&#x2019; end, human TMPRSS2 ORF (GeneBank accession number: NM_001135099.1) and the Puromycin drug resistance gene ORF were in-tandem positioned and linked by two Internal Ribosomal Entry Sites (IRES) (ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2-IRES-Puromycin). This large tricistronic ORF was chemically synthetized and sub-cloned downstream to the human Elongation Factor 1 alpha promoter (EF1&#x03B1;), upstream to the SV40 polyA signal/site in a pUC plasmid backbone. Thus, pEF1&#x03B1;-ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro was generated (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). pEF1&#x03B1;-ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro, was electroporated in HEK293T cells and stably transfected cells were obtained by selection with puromycin. Since puromycin drug resistance gene ORF is the last to be translated from the mRNA transcribed from pEF1&#x03B1;-ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro, the selection of puromycin selected resistant cells (HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro) indeed guaranteed the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cells were kept, so far, for over thirty passages without loss of functionality/expression. Noteworthy, HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cells do not need to be constantly maintained in culture, under puromycin selection: a large batch of them can be grown, aliquoted at a suitable concentration, stored at &#x2212;80 C&#x00B0; or in liquid nitrogen and successively used, when needed, by simply thawing an aliquot of them, without any loss of functionality.</p>

<title>Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein in mammalian cells</title>
<p>CoV-2 S is a key factor for SARS-CoV-2 target cell infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent patient sera can block <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> CoV-2 infectivity, thus being exploitable for CoV-2 infection diagnosis and for the evaluation of CoV-2 vaccination efficacy (the titer of neutralizing antibody present in a serum is a correlate of protection), as well as for preliminary test molecules able to interfere with S, ACE2 and TMPRRS2 interaction. Before attempting the generation of a Lenti-based pseudovirus displaying CoV-2 S on its surface, it was indispensable to generate an appropriate expression cassette capable to drive an efficient expression of S, accommodated on the pseudovirus envelope surface. The cytoplasmic tails of some CoV S proteins contain an Endoplasmic Reticulum Retrieval Signal (ERRS) that can retrieve S proteins from the Golgi to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). This process is thought to accumulate S proteins at the CoV budding site, the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC), and to facilitate S protein incorporation into virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. In contrast to Coronaviruses, Lentiviruses assemble and buds at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], therefore truncation of the S-protein cytoplasmic tail may increase cell surface levels and/or enable incorporation by alleviating structural incompatibility of the S-protein cytoplasmic tail and lentivirus proteins. CoV-2 S ORF sequence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/1791269090">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/1791269090</ext-link>) was deprived of its last 57 bp, coding for a predicted ERRS (KFDEDDSEPVLKGVKLHYT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and substituted with the Hemoagglutinin (HA) tag. The so designed ORF (S-&#x0394;RS-HA) was human codon usage adapted, with the use of the Jcat codon adaptation tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcat.de/">http://www.jcat.de/</ext-link>), to change nucleotide codon composition to a composition based on human genome codon usage. The degeneracy of the genetic code leads to a situation whereby most of the amino acids can be encoded by two to six synonymous codons. The synonymous codons are not equally utilized to encode the amino acids, thus resulting in phenomenon of codon usage bias. Since codon usage bias has been shown to correlate with gene expression level, it has been proposed as an important design parameter for enhancing recombinant protein production in heterologous host expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. The GC content of S-&#x0394;RS-HA is 37&#x0025; and adaptation to the human genome codon usage shifted the GC content from 37&#x0025; up to 63&#x0025; (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Although we did not compare the adapted S-&#x0394;RS-HA ORF with the un-adapted one in terms of expression efficiency, previous studies have shown that GC-rich genes in mammalian cells can be expressed 100-fold more efficiently than their GC-poor counterpart due to increased steady-state mRNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. S-&#x0394;RS-HA was chemically synthetized and integrated in a transfer vector under the transcriptional guide of the Immediate Early gene promoter of human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and followed by an IRES, the puromycin drug resistance gene and the Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus (WHP) Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element (WPRE) (pLV-CMV-(S-&#x0394;RS-HA)-IRES-Puro-WPRE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> for complete sequence).</p>

This syncytiogenic effect was attributable to the interaction between S, ACE2 and TMPRRS2, which recapitulated the bonafide fusogenic activity of S when is attached to ACE2, proteolytically activated by TMPRSS2 and regulated by Interferon-Induced Transmembrane (IFITMs) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].

<title>Generation of a lenti-based pseudovirus</title>
<p>Relying on the promising results obtained with pLV-CMV-(S-&#x0394;RS-HA)-IRES-Puro-WPRE construct and HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cell line, the reconstitution of a second generation replicating incompetent lentivirus, pseudotyped with CoV-2 S was attempted. The pLV-EF1&#x03B1;-(turboGFP-Luc2)-WPRE transfer vector, the p8.74 packaging vector and the pLV-CMV-(S-&#x0394;RS-HA)-IRES-Puro-WPRE pseudotyping vector were co-transfected in HEK293T cells. Twenty-four and 48 hours post-transfection, Transfected Cells Supernatant (TCS) were harvested, clarified, filtered, aliquoted, stored at &#x2212;80 &#x00B0;C and subsequently tested on HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cells and on HEK293T cells as negative control. Since pLV-EF1&#x03B1;-(turboGFP-Luc2)-WPRE transfer vector could simultaneously deliver two reporter genes, turboGFP and a human codon usage adapted luciferase (Luc2), cell transduction could be detected either by fluorescence or luminometry. In fact, when different amount of TCS were tested on different numbers of HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cells, an efficient cell transduction could be observed but not on HEK293T negative control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).

<title>Lentivirus-based vector can be pseudotyped with ACE2/TMPRSS2</title>
<p>TMPRSS2 is a serine protease with a class II transmembrane domain, whereas ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase with a class I transmembrane domain and both of them are localized on the cell membrane surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Based on this information it was reasoned that lentiviral vector particles could potentially be pseudotyped with ACE2/TMPRSS2 and allow pseudovirus penetration into cells expressing CoV-2 S. The pLV-EF1&#x03B1;-(turboGFP-Luc2)-WPRE transfer vector, the p8.74 packaging vector and the pEF1&#x03B1;-ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro pseudotyping vector were co-transfected in HEK293T cells. Twenty-four and 48 hours post transfection TCS were harvested, aliquoted, stored at &#x2212;80 C&#x00B0; and subsequently tested on pLV-CMV-(S-&#x0394;RS-HA)-IRES-Puro-WPRE transiently or stably transfected HEK/S-&#x0394;RS-HA/Puro cells and on HEK293T cells as negative control. TCS transduction could be observed on HEK/S-&#x0394;RS-HA/Puro cells but not on HEK293T cells negative control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Therefore, a lentivirus-based vector could be pseudotyped with ACE2/TMPRSS2. Worth of note, this kind of pseudotypization and cell transduction did not generate syncytia as observed for the lentivirus-based vector pseudotyped with CoV-2 S. Although the reason of this issue was not investigated, because out of the purpose of this work, it could be assumed that the syncytia formation is an active process in part dependent by a specific intracellular apparatus, contacting the long cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2, present inside the cells but absent inside the pseudotyped lentiviral particles. It was shown that infection with CoV-2 was significantly decreased in cells expressing ACE2 mutant versions lacking the cytoplasmic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>

<title>Assessment of a pseudovirus neutralization assay</title>
<p>Starting from the availability of a pseudovirus mimicking the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with target cells, it was of interest to assess a pseudovirus neutralization assay, to be applied for several purposes. The aim of this assay is to overcome the other neutralization assays complexities, such as multiple passages and the addition and removal of reagents and solutions, mainly during sera dilution and detection steps, where cells could detach from the microplate surface and strong errors could be introduced. In our simplified system reagents and solution are only added at each step, while washing steps are absent, from the beginning to the end of the assay.</p>
<p>Opaque wall, clear flat bottom 96 well microplates were employed (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Opaque walls prevent well-to-well crosstalk for luminometric detection whereas clear flat bottom well direct microscopic monitoring cell growth and/or fluorescence microscope observation of transduced cells expressing a fluorescent reporter gene, in this specific case turboGFP. The neutralization assay was performed with human sera coming from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, collected after post&#x2013;symptoms onset, that resulted positive to PCR and ELISA tests. Whereas, sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 emergence (1999) that tested negative in ELISA were used as negative control. First, serial dilution of the sera (plasma from EDTA treated blood can be used too), were incubated for 90 minutes with TCS containing pseudovirus sufficient to achieve approximately 10<sup>4</sup> Relative Light Units (RLUs) of luciferase signal per well (usually no more than 2 to 10 &#x00B5;L). Subsequently 10<sup>4</sup> HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cells were added to each well (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). As previously mentioned, HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cells do not need to be constantly kept in culture under puromycin selection: a large batch of them can be grown, aliquoted at a suitable concentration, stored at &#x2212;80 C&#x00B0; or in liquid nitrogen and be immediately ready to use after thawing. Alternatively, HEK293T cells can be electroporated with pEF1&#x03B1;-ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro and directly used, obtaining the same result. NT50 could be measured as soon as 48 hours after adding the cells, either by a fluorescence microscope, or by luminometry and simply adding Luciferine in each well (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), without the need of cell lysis and of transferring the lysate to a different microplate. Moreover, light detection can be performed with a Digital Imager for western blotting, BLI, or by a multiwell plate reader luminometer.</p>

<caption><p>Representative pseudovirus neutralization assay. Six PCR and ELISA CoV2 negative patients&#x2019; representative sera (1 to 6), 3 PCR and ELISA CoV2 positive patients&#x2019; sera (7 to 9) and 2 pre-pandemic sera (collected in the 1998; 10 and 11) were tested. A further negative control was established without serum (12), which was substituted with complete medium. (A) Histogram obtained from luminometric detection of transduced cells with pseudovirus. Relative Luciferase Units (RLUs) were compared and normalized to those derived from wells where pseudovirus were added in the absence of sera (100&#x0025;). Neutralization titer 50 (NT<sub>50</sub>) was expressed as the maximal dilution of the sera where the reduction of the signal was &#x2265;50&#x0025;. In this specific example, the NT<sub>50</sub>/25&#x00B5;L of the serum 7 is 1:256, that of the serum 8 is 1:128 and that of the serum 9 is 1:64. However, because the titer was measured on 25 &#x00B5;L, the apparent NT<sub>50</sub> has to be multiplied per 40 to get the normalized NT<sub>50</sub>/mL. Therefore, the NT<sub>50</sub>/mL of the sera 7 is 1:10256, that of the serum 8 is 1:5120 and that of the serum 9 is 1:2560. (B) Colorimetric visualization of the RLUs displayed by the luminometer software, during and after reading.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Thus, a rapid, flexible, reliable, sensitive and cost effective pseudovirus neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 was established, where all steps could be performed in the same plate and in a standard BSL2 laboratory, since the pseudovirus is completely safe. With this assay we have been able to rapidly and cheaply determine the neutralizing potency of mAbs derived from serum or plasma samples in a BSL2 laboratory. Automation and additional miniaturization is certainly possible to further increase throughput. Since serum neutralizing activity has long been identified as a correlate of protection in many viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], including CoVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and a global CoV-2 vaccination campaign is ongoing, it is absolutely important to have a practical test to assess the outcome of vaccination. In order to meet this need, such test must be rapid, flexible, reliable, sensitive, quantitative, cost effective, safe and easily adapted to different coronaviruses variants.</p>

<caption><p>1) Dilution of the sera</p>
<p>25&#x00B5;L of complete medium are added to each well of the microplate and 25 &#x00B5;L of each serum is added to each well of the first line of wells. Than 25 &#x00B5;L of the first dilution of the sera (1:2) are mixed and passed to the subsequent lines of wells. 25&#x00B5;L from the last line of wells are discarded. Therefore, the final volume for each well is 25&#x00B5;L.</p>
<p>2) Adding the pseudovirus</p>
<p>25&#x00B5;L of pseudovirus in complete medium (corresponding to 10<sup>4</sup> RLUs; &#x223C;3-5&#x00B5;L of the initial preparation) are added to each well and left at room temperature for 1,5 hours. Final volume for each well is 50&#x00B5;L, therefore the sera dilution is doubled (1:4-1:8-1:16-1:32-1:64-1:128-1:256-1:512).</p>
<p>3) Adding the cells</p>
<p>50&#x00B5;L of complete medium containing 10<sup>4</sup> HEK/ACE2/TMPRRS2/Puro cells are added to each well and left for 1,5 hours in cell incubator. Final volume for each well is 100&#x00B5;L.</p>
<p>4) Adding the Luciferine and reading</p>
<p>25&#x00B5;L of complete medium containing Luciferine (20&#x00B5;L of complete medium plus 5&#x00B5;L of 15mg/mL Luciferine in PBS) are added to each well just before the luminometric reading of the microplate. Final volume for each well is 125&#x00B5;L. Since the plate has a transparent bottom, a dark film layer should be applied for reading.</p>
<p>RLUs obtained were compared and normalized to those derived from wells where pseudovirus were added in the absence of plasma/sera (100&#x0025;). Neutralization titer 50 (NT<sub>50</sub>/mL) was expressed as the maximal dilution of the sera where the reduction of the signal is &#x2265;50&#x0025;. This titer has to be multiplied per 40 because the initial volume of the sera tested is 0,025mL and it has to be normalized to 1mL. This is a very important issue because SN protocol could differ from each lab and the initial amount of sera tested could be different in volume. However, in most of the case, operators tend to indicate SN<sub>50</sub> and not SN<sub>50</sub>/mL.</p></caption>
