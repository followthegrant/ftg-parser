<meta name="DC.Description" content="As the largest conduit vessel, the aorta is responsible for the conversion of phasic systolic inflow from ventricular ejection into more continuous blood delivery to peripheral arteries. Distension during systole and recoil during diastole conserves ventricular energy and is enabled by the specialized composition of the aortic extracellular matrix. Aortic distensibility decreases with age and prematurely in vascular disease. To discover genetic determinants of aortic distensibility we trained a deep learning model to quantify aortic size throughout the cardiac cycle and calculate aortic distensibility and aortic strain in 42,342 participants in the UK Biobank with available cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. In up to 40,028 participants with genetic data, common variant analysis identified 12 and 26 loci for ascending and 11 and 21 loci for descending aortic distensibility and strain, respectively. Of the newly identified loci, 22 were specific to strain or distensibility and were not identified in a thoracic aortic diameter GWAS within the same samples. Loci associated with both aortic diameter and aortic strain or distensibility demonstrated a consistent, inverse directionality. Transcriptome-wide analyses, rare-variant burden tests, and analyses of gene expression in single nucleus RNA sequencing of human aorta were performed to prioritize genes at individual loci. Loci highlighted multiple genes involved in elastogenesis, matrix degradation, and extracellular polysaccharide generation. Characterization of the genetic determinants of aortic function may provide novel targets for medical intervention in aortic disease.

<meta name="twitter:site" content="@medrxivpreprint" />
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary" />
<meta name="twitter:description" content="As the largest conduit vessel, the aorta is responsible for the conversion of phasic systolic inflow from ventricular ejection into more continuous blood delivery to peripheral arteries. Distension during systole and recoil during diastole conserves ventricular energy and is enabled by the specialized composition of the aortic extracellular matrix. Aortic distensibility decreases with age and prematurely in vascular disease. To discover genetic determinants of aortic distensibility we trained a deep learning model to quantify aortic size throughout the cardiac cycle and calculate aortic distensibility and aortic strain in 42,342 participants in the UK Biobank with available cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. In up to 40,028 participants with genetic data, common variant analysis identified 12 and 26 loci for ascending and 11 and 21 loci for descending aortic distensibility and strain, respectively. Of the newly identified loci, 22 were specific to strain or distensibility and were not identified in a thoracic aortic diameter GWAS within the same samples. Loci associated with both aortic diameter and aortic strain or distensibility demonstrated a consistent, inverse directionality. Transcriptome-wide analyses, rare-variant burden tests, and analyses of gene expression in single nucleus RNA sequencing of human aorta were performed to prioritize genes at individual loci. Loci highlighted multiple genes involved in elastogenesis, matrix degradation, and extracellular polysaccharide generation. Characterization of the genetic determinants of aortic function may provide novel targets for medical intervention in aortic disease.

### Author Declarations

I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

Yes

The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:

UK Biobank data are made available to researchers from research institutions with genuine research inquiries, following IRB and UK Biobank approval. Single nucleus sequencing data were retrieved from the Broad Institute Single Cell Portal #SCP1265.

I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.

Yes

I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).

Yes

I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.

Yes

GWAS summary statistics and polygenic score weights will be available upon publication at the Broad Institute Cardiovascular Disease Knowledge Portal (http://www.broadcvdi.org). Aortic diameter, strain, and distensibility measurements will be returned to the UK Biobank for use by any approved researcher. All other data are contained within the article and its supplementary information.

Distension during systole and recoil during diastole conserves ventricular energy and is enabled by the specialized composition of the aortic extracellular matrix. Aortic distensibility decreases with age and prematurely in vascular disease. To discover genetic determinants of aortic distensibility we trained a deep learning model to quantify aortic size throughout the cardiac cycle and calculate aortic distensibility and aortic strain in 42,342 participants in the UK Biobank with available cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. In up to 40,028 participants with genetic data, common variant analysis identified 12 and 26 loci for ascending and 11 and 21 loci for descending aortic distensibility and strain, respectively. Of the newly identified loci, 22 were specific to strain or distensibility and were not identified in a thoracic aortic diameter GWAS within the same samples. Loci associated with both aortic diameter and aortic strain or distensibility demonstrated a consistent, inverse directionality. Transcriptome-wide analyses, rare-variant burden tests, and analyses of gene expression in single nucleus RNA sequencing of human aorta were performed to prioritize genes at individual loci. Loci highlighted multiple genes involved in elastogenesis, matrix degradation, and extracellular polysaccharide generation. Characterization of the genetic determinants of aortic function may provide novel targets for medical intervention in aortic disease.</p></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-4">Dr. Pirruccello has served as a consultant for Maze Therapeutics and has received research support from IBM Research.
