<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are used to test for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives are possible depending on the individual, swab type and timing as infection progresses.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Objectives</title>
<p>To determine how the false negative test probability in infected patients depends on the time since symptom onset and swab type.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We use General Additive Mixed Models to analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We identify that the probability of a positive test decreases with time after symptom onset, with oropharyngeal [OP]samples less likely to yield a positive result than nasopharyngeal [NP] ones. We also comment on the likely false negative rates in cohorts of patients who present for testing at different clinical stages and assess the robustness of these estimates to the probability of false positive tests.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>NP samples are more sensitive than OP samples. The later an infected individual is tested after the onset of symptoms, the less likely they are to test positive. This has implications for identification of infected patients, contact tracing, and also for the discharge of convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious. There is an urgent need for data from asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Currently, most SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals are identified by successful amplification of the virus from throat or nasal swabs in the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. These tests are highly specific but there are many reasons why sensitivity is imperfect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Indeed, multiple studies have observed negative RT-PCR results on at least 1 occasion for SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Such false-negative results have implications for correct diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] and subsequent community transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], and thus for control initiatives, not only during emergence but also in any subsequent waves of transmission. For example, even in countries in Europe and Asia where outbreaks now seem to be under control, it remains unclear what fraction of the population has already been exposed and therefore the extent to which there remains the potential for large outbreaks following the reintroduction of the virus. Successful attempts to test and trace resurgent outbreaks will require a proper understanding of how test results alone cannot confirm or deny that an individual is infected with the virus, but also need to be taken in context with the other available information (such as the timing and type of test performed).</p>
<p>A series of previous studies have described cohorts of tested individuals. Ai and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], for instance, retrospectively considered 1014 infected patients of whom 413 (41&#x0025;) tested negative by RT-PCR at initial presentation. Xie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] similarly considered 167 infected patients of whom 5 (3&#x0025;) tested negative by RT-PCR at initial presentation. Fang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] found that RT-PCR was only able to identify 36/51 (71&#x0025;) of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients when using swabs taken 0-6 days after the onset of symptoms. Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]Zhao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] have demonstrated that the proportion of positive tests among infected patients dropped with each week since the onset of symptoms, and Luo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] reported that the initial sensitivity of throat swabs in secondary contacts was 71&#x0025;. Meanwhile in a study of 213 patients, Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] found lower positive test rates from throat swabs (24&#x0025;) compared to nasal swabs (57&#x0025;).</p>
<p>Although these particular studies relate to longitudinal testing of infected patients, the data is not disaggregated per patient. Some authors have however presented sequential test data from individual patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Here we use the latter type of data to characterise how the probability of a false-negative test result depends on the number of days between the onset of symptoms and the performance of the test, and how this is affected by the site from which swabs are taken. We also estimate the number of false-negatives in different cohorts of tested individuals, under the assumption that they are only tested once; and assess the sensitivity of these results to the specificity of the test. Our results have implications for both existing estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and the likelihood of correctly identifying the infected status of an individual, where these rely solely on RT-PCR tests.</p>

<title>Data sources</title>
<p>Data for all sources were read directly from figures. To qualify for inclusion, studies had to report extractable results for longitudinal RT-PCR tests from individual patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least once. The timing of swab collection had to be stated as the number of days after the patient became symptomatic. We identified seven studies that met these criteria and reported nasopharyngeal swab results [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with two also reporting results for oropharyngeal swabs in the same patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Several studies with longitudinal patient data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] only vaguely described the sampling location (e.g. &#x201C;upper respiratory tract&#x201D;) or did not make clear which results belonged to which patient. Other types of sample - such as sputum and saliva - were not considered as the collection methods were different to swabs. These 7 studies provided data from 786 tests on 95 patients for nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Summary information about the included studies is presented in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Data analysis: Estimating RT-PCR sensitivity</title>
<p>Data were analysed using binomially-distributed (logit-link) generalised additive mixed models (GAMM) with the package mgcv [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] in the statistical software R version 3.6.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. We tested hypotheses that the probability of a positive result will change through time after symptom onset, that different swab type may have different detection probabilities and that each study may have a different baseline detection probability (due to, for example, differing testing procedures). The effect of the number of days since symptom onset was modelled as a continuous smooth function (cubic regression splines), while swab location and data source were included as two-level categorical variables. Random effects were included in the form of patient-specific smooth functions, modelling between-patient differences in the probability of returning a positive test through time. All of the models we examine included this random effect, as patient samples were pseudo-replicated by design. Models were compared in a stepwise down procedure from the most complex structure using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The difference in AIC values (&#x0394;AIC) values were calculated in relation to the lowest AIC value. Detailed methodology is available in Supplementary File 1.</p>

<title>Data analysis: Estimating the number of false-negatives in a cohort of tested individuals</title>
<p>Results from Bi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] suggests that the probability of an infected individual getting a positive RT-PCR test of SARS-CoV-2 after a given number of days since the onset of symptoms follows a gamma distribution with shape 2.12 and rate 0.39 (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and Table S2 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]). We can use this together with our results on RT-PCR sensitivity and apply Bayes&#x2019; Theorem to recover the distribution of the time from onset of symptoms to getting tested (see Supplementary File 1l), which ends up as a distribution with a heavier tail (than the original gamma distribution) because the false-negative test probability increases with time.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="20053355v3_fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>If we assume further that this distribution is generally representative and does not vary over the course of the epidemic, we can use it to estimate how many infected individuals are incorrectly identified as uninfected among a group of symptomatic tested individuals who are only tested once. We can further explore how the false-positive test probability affects these estimates and illustrate this using the numbers of tests performed and positive test results from the UK and South Korea as of 20th March 2020 (UK: 5.1&#x0025; positive [3277 / 64621 positive tests]; SK: 2.7&#x0025; [8652 / 316664 positive tests] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]). It is important to stress that this exercise is illustrative rather than assertive: we show how accounting for the false-negative and false-positive test probabilities affects the estimate of the number of infected individuals among those tested, taking broad assumptions (e.g. all individuals only tested once; that the distribution to test is as we have assumed; that all those tested are symptomatic) any or all of which is likely to be violated in these datasets. Therefore, we do not make specific predictions but are rather presenting a sensitivity of scale for the overall impact of accounting for the false-negative and false-positive test probabilities.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our most complex model included two fixed effects (a smooth effect of day and a different intercept for each swab type) as well as a random intercept for each study and each patient (model AIC = 805.79). Removing the random intercept for study was supported (AIC = 805.31, &#x0394;AIC = &#x2212;0.47), suggesting that the baseline probability of detection was consistent across different cohorts, test targets and sample processing procedures. Excluding swab type was not supported (AIC = 813.15, &#x0394;AIC = 7.83), nor was excluding the effect of days since symptom onset (AIC = 974.30, &#x0394;AIC = 168.99). The final model structure with the highest support contained the fixed effect of swab type, the effect of time since symptom onset and a random intercept for each patient. The full model output is given in the Supplementary File 1.</p>
<p>Swabs taken from the throat immediately upon symptom onset were predicted to be 5.64&#x0025; less likely to yield a positive result than a nasal swab (logit-scale effect size &#x2212;1.00 CI [&#x2212;1.54, &#x2212;0.46]). The probability of a positive test decreases with the number of days past symptom onset: for a nasal swab, the percentage chance of a positive test declines from 96.40&#x0025; [90.98, 98.6] on day 0 to 75.47&#x0025; [66.88, 82.51] by day 10 and only a 3.30&#x0025; [0.53, 17.90] chance of a positive result by day 31; for throat swabs the probabilities were 90.76&#x0025; [77.84, 96.52], 53.00&#x0025; [38.27, 67.46] and 1.23&#x0025; [0.18, 7.86] for day 0, 10 and 31 respectively. The model fit is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and the underlying quantitative results (data) are available in Supplementary File 2.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Visualising the impact of time to test on false-negative test probabilities</title>
<p>As shown above, the probability of a false-negative test result depends on the number of days since symptom onset. This means that simple reports of positive and negative test counts among individuals who are only tested once will underestimate the true number of positive tests in a cohort. We can illustrate the potential impact this has on average false-negative test probabilities by supposing that the time from onset of symptoms to testing follows a gamma-distribution.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> explores how varying the shape and rate of this distribution affects the average false-negative test probability in a cohort, and highlights that in scenarios where infected individuals are typically tested late, the false-negative test probability can be 4 times larger than when patients are typically tested early. We also show how the probability of incorrectly identifying an individual as uninfected due to a false-negative test considerably reduces if all negative tests are repeated 24 hours later. We note that the realised error rate (the actual proportion of false negative tests) will be proportional to the underlying prevalence of infection; only if everyone in the cohort is infected would the probability of a false negative equal the proportion of negative tests (as there will be no true negatives from uninfected individuals).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Estimating the number of false-negatives in a cohort of tested individuals</title>
<p>We further demonstrate how the results of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, together with assumptions about the false-positive test probability, might affect testing outcomes in practice.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows that when the false-positive test probability is very small then the estimated number of infections among those tested is increased by around 30&#x0025;, but this estimate decreases linearly as the false-positive test probability increases. In fact, for some critical (yet small) value for the false-positive test probability, there will be more false-positives than false-negatives. Moreover, the false positive test probability has a bigger impact when the percentage of the original tests that were positive is smaller (this follows directly from the underlying derivations - see Supplementary Methods in Supplementary File 1).</p>
<fig id="fig4" position="float" fig-type="figure">

<graphic xlink:href="20053355v3_fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Overall this illustrates 3 important things: that for a zero or very small false-positive test probability, the true number of infected individuals among those tested will be substantially larger than the number of positive tests; that increasing false-positive test probabilities decrease these estimates until they eventually go negative (even for quite small values of the false-positive test probability); and that such decreases are more severe in situations where the apparent prevalence among those tested is lower.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s4">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Testing from single throat or nasal swab by RT-PCR is not guaranteed to yield a (true) positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection and this probability decreases with time since the onset of symptoms. In other words, the longer the time from the onset of symptoms until a suspected case is tested, the more likely a false-negative result. Repeat testing of suspected but RT-PCR negative infections may not always be feasible, but our results suggest that repeat testing drastically decreases the chances of failing to identify infected individuals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, failing to account for the possibility of false-negative tests potentially biases upwards many of the existing estimates for case and infection fatality rates of SARS-CoV-2 e.g. where they rely on perfect sensitivity among international travellers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>
<p>We also show how even small false-positive test probabilities can have an opposite impact on any assessment of the &#x201C;true&#x201D; number of infections in a tested cohort and hence bias case and infection fatality risk estimates in the opposite direction. Better understanding of the false-positive test probability and accounting for precisely when and how individuals have been tested would therefore improve the quality of any estimates that rely on the number of positive tests in a cohort of tested individuals.</p>
<p>Our results have important implications for SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies. Presently, RT-PCR testing regimes vary significantly between countries, determined both by policy decisions, testing capacity and perceived incidence. Some countries opt (or, rather, are able) to test large portions of the population, including those who are asymptomatic or self-isolating with mild symptoms. In countries such as South Korea, where testing has been thorough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], the distribution of test timing is crucial: if many of those tested were infected some time ago but only had mild or asymptomatic infections (and therefore did not present for treatment), they will be more likely to return a false negative result. In countries that do not currently have mass testing, there are calls for testing to be expanded to the population at large with the aim of determining how many people carry, or have recently carried the virus. While RT-PCR testing of key workers is of great importance (particularly those working with vulnerable groups), our results suggest that there may be little benefit to testing indiscriminately; in fact, conducting a single test on someone who had symptoms 10 days ago will have a nearly 25&#x0025; chance of being a false negative (using a nasal swab; 47&#x0025; for a throat swab). As a means of determining population level exposure to SARS-CoV-2, serological tests of known specificity and sensitivity are far more likely to provide an accurate profile (if these are known, then recovery of the likely level of population exposure is possible, even if it is not possible to determine which individuals have been exposed. This, however, would assume that all those infected will go on to develop and maintain detectable serological responses, which may not always be the case in e.g. mild infections, or across all age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]).</p>
<p>In almost all countries, tests will be conducted on patients presenting with symptoms at a hospital in order to streamline treatment and prevent further infection. We do not suggest that the problem of false negatives is under appreciated by medical professionals; it is presently recognised by both the guidelines from the World Health Organisation (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] and the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] that a single negative test is insufficient to rule out infection, with discharge criteria stating that a patient should only be released if two repeat tests return negative results. Early in the outbreak, clinicians used chest CT to look for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients who returned a negative result, minimising the risk of false negatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>].</p>
<p>We also note that RT-PCR tests will return positive results even if the virus is inert - only by culturing the sample is it possible to verify that a patient is actually infectious. To date, the available information suggests that it is possible for individuals with mild disease to shed for at least 18 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] and those with severe disease for at least 20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]; but evidence is mounting that successful culture of virus is associated with high viral loads and perhaps also not yet having a detectable serological response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Further characterisation of these important relationships is required, but it suggests that quantitative estimates of (still detectable) viral load and/or seroconversion could be used as tools to safely discharge infected individuals from quarantine or hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. In light of this evidence, our study cannot readily assist with such decisions not least because the higher false-negative test probabilities we report with time since symptom onset are themselves almost certainly related to lower viral loads with time; what would be more useful would be quantitative estimates of how viral load changes with time since symptom onset. Repeat measurements and calculation of viral load in infected individuals would allow more precise interpretation of RT-PCR results, specifically whether a &#x201C;negative&#x201D; or high cycle threshold (CT) result is consistent with the previous trend in that patient, or is anomalous, and so determine how likely the individual is to still be infectious. Modelling efforts could help enormously on this topic, but in the meantime our results suggest that multiple negative tests would be consistent with the viral load having reduced to a sub-infectious level, but a single negative test may only represent a spurious test result.</p>
<p>Major implications of our results relate directly to contact tracing of infected individuals. Since it is possible for infected individuals to test negative for infection even soon after the development of symptoms, this means that a single negative test alone is also insufficient for ruling out infection in their recent contacts, who may have already been infected and be currently in the latent phase or a- or pre-symptomatic themselves. It may therefore be prudent to assume that contacts of suspected infected individuals may be infected themselves and isolate and regularly test them until either there is firm evidence that the putative index case was not actually infected (or at least infectious) at the time of the contact, or assess if the incubation period for the contact has passed without evidence that the contacts have themselves been infected. Doing so would enhance infection control and also ultimately provide more detail on test sensitivity at all possible stages of infection.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrate how the sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the time from the onset of symptoms in symptomatic individuals, and show how nasal swabs appear more sensitive than throat swabs. In the absence of other testing procedures, this has implications for clinical decisions about treatment, and control / contact tracing decisions about who needs to be quarantined or can be released safely into the community. We also illustrate how, assuming that the false positive test probability is negligible, the count of positive tests underestimates the count of infected individuals in a cohort of tested individuals, which in turn has implications for estimates of case and infection fatality rates in the wider population. However, if the false-positive test probability is non-zero, then values as low as 0.5&#x0025; - 1&#x0025; could mean that the true prevalence among those tested is lower than suggested by the naive count of positive tests.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>First, more data exists than we have been able to analyse. Many of the studies cited here (&#x0026; others - e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]) have longitudinal data from more patients but which is not currently publicly available and we were unable to obtain, or is not disaggregated by swab type. Inclusion of this data would provide superior estimates, in particular if it is disaggregated into tests done from different samples via different routes in the same patient. Moreover, explicit reporting of dates when tests are performed in all patients (and not just those who test positive) would be especially useful to any subsequent similar analyses for SARS-CoV-2 or other emerging viruses. We thus advocate for such data to be made available more readily in publications and preprints.</p>
<p>Second, we have attempted to account for possible differences among labs performing RT-PCR tests and although we do not find any evidence in favour of this being relevant, nor is there enough evidence to rule it out. There may also be variation in terms of the gene that is targeted, or method of RT-PCR performed, which we have also not been able to consider due to lack of available data (e.g. some target / assay combinations may be more sensitive than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]). We have also assumed that all the patients have been correctly identified as infected in each study and that the specificity of the test is perfect; it is likely to be extremely high but perhaps not 100&#x0025; and may similarly vary with assay type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Third, we have attempted to account for possible differences among patients in their sensitivity to the test. In reality, one might expect this to be related to either the underlying severity of the infection (perhaps a higher chance of detection when disease is more severe) or, at least, viral load (higher chance of detection with higher viral load); neither of which we have been able to assess with currently available data. Furthermore, the data we use is from symptomatic patients, most of which were sick enough to require hospital treatment, and it is possible that RT-PCR is less sensitive in asymptomatic individuals (not least because there is no onset of symptoms and it is therefore unclear from which baseline test sensitivity should be measured) or those with more mild disease. A recent Italian study offered evidence that, among those testing positive, viral loads were equivalent in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. This does not show, however, that viral loads are the same in both groups, but that they are equivalent conditional on a positive test, which is what we might expect if the probability of a positive test is indeed linked to viral load. If this is true, then it could be that many asymptomatically infected individuals are asymptomatic because their immune responses keep viral replication in check early on and so viral loads sufficient to result in a positive test may not be achieved. However, such a scenario might be difficult to square with the apparent transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Better understanding of the sensitivity of the test in asymptomatic individuals is of paramount importance but was impossible to assess with currently available data.</p>
<p>Fourth, and related, we do not have access to testing data from the pre-symptomatic period of infection. The high detection probability at symptom onset suggests that viral load could be high during the incubation period, particularly just before the onset of symptoms. We would also expect that the chances of detecting infection on the day of exposure is next to zero, but the detection probability between exposure and prior to symptom onset will likely be contingent on a number of factors, including the initial infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 and the length of the incubation period. More data is urgently needed to answer these questions, particularly given the estimated transmission potential in this period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]</p>
<p>Finally, when estimating the true number of positives in a cohort of tested individuals we have to additionally assume that the distribution of the time to test is the same as we infer from our results here and the distribution of time to confirmation in Guangdong ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]). Even if this distribution is broadly representative from country to country, it may not be consistent over time. For example, as testing capacity gets stretched, the time to test may increase and so too the probability of a consequent false-negative (or vice versa as testing capacity is enhanced). These particular results should therefore be taken as indicative rather than authoritative. Furthermore, these results only relate to the cohort of tested individuals rather than the population at large: they say nothing about the prevalence of the virus among those not tested. That said, individual hospitals, testing centres or studies will know the timings of their tests and can use such information in conjunction with the quantitative findings that we make available in Supplementary Files to assess how likely any one test is to represent a false-negative.</p>
<p>This work has advanced our understanding of the significant effect that false negative RT-PCR tests can have on the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. We have demonstrated the sensitivity of population prevalence estimates to erroneous test results, and caution that single negative tests should not be overinterpreted. This is particularly pertinent when tests are used to determine if healthcare staff and carers are safe to work with those most vulnerable to disease, or whether to isolate contacts of suspected infections. As nations begin lifting strict social distancing measures and returning to some semblance of normality after the first epidemic wave, being able to dependably contact trace and test new infections will be critical to prevent resurgence. This work suggests caution should always be used when interpreting a single, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result.</p>
