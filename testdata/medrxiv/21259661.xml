<sec>
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Proxalutamide, a second-generation non-steroidal antiandrogen (NSAA), primarily developed for castration-resistant prostate cancer, demonstrated reduction in 28-day mortality rate of 77.7&#x0025; in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT), through intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. We observed a high 28-day mortality rate of patients that did not complete the 14-day treatment with proxalutamide, compared to the placebo arm. These differences may raise hypotheses to explain the wide differences between ITT and on-treatment (OT) analysis in terms of efficacy. Despite the inherent limitations of OT analysis, we aimed to respond to unanswered questions regarding the drug efficacy when the 14-day treatment with proxalutamide was complete, and secondarily understand the causality relationship between treatment interruption and mortality rate.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This is a <italic>post-hoc</italic> exploratory analysis of a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective, multicentric, two-arm RCT of 300mg-daily 14-day proxalutamide therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation. OT population excluded patients that did not complete the full 14-day course of therapy or died from COVID-19 complications within 24 hours of randomization. The primary outcome was the 28-day COVID-19 mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included median hospital length, 14-day and 28-day alive hospital discharge rate and 28-day all-cause mortality rate of those who discontinued intervention.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 580 patients completed the 14-day treatment or died during treatment, including 288 patients in the proxalutamide arm and 292 patients in the placebo arm, with similar baseline characteristics between groups. The 28-day COVID-19 mortality rate was 4.2&#x0025; in the proxalutamide group and 49.0&#x0025; in the placebo group. The mortality risk ratio (RR) was 0.08 (95&#x0025; CI, 0.05-0.15), with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2.2 to prevent death. The median hospital length stay after randomization was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 3 to 7.2 days) in the proxalutamide group and 9 days (IQR = 6 to 15 days) in the placebo group (p &#x003C;0.001). The 28-day all-cause mortality rate of patients that received proxalutamide but interrupted treatment before 14 days was 79.3&#x0025;, while those that received placebo and interrupted before 14 days was 52.8&#x0025; (p = 0.054 between groups).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality rate with 14-day proxalutamide treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients was more significant while on treatment adhesion (92&#x0025;), compared to the reduction when all patients enrolled in the proxalutamide arm were considered (77.7&#x0025;). However, the magnitude of statistical significance of the reduction in all-cause mortality and the NNT were similar between the OT and ITT analysis. The apparent high mortality risk rate with early interruption of proxalutamide treatments suggests that strategies for treatment compliance should be reinforced for future RCTs with proxalutamide.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The identification of potential molecules that reduces severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity and pathogenicity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity is critical while the COVID-19 pandemics is not fully controlled. While vaccines are considered as the most efficient public health measure to reduce COVID-19 mortality preventively, we still struggle to find effective drugs to reduce COVID-19 poorer outcomes among those already infected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a key enzyme for viral cell entry, since it primes SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to allow for a more efficient subsequent binding to membrane-attached angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> The only known endogenous modulators of TMPRSS2 expression are androgens. Antiandrogens are promising agents against COVID-19 due to their potential actions in the blockage of the entrance of the SARS-CoV-2 into the cells, through the inhibition of TMPRSS2 expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Early observations in COVID-19 pandemic have identified hyperandrogenic phenotypes as independent risk factors for disease severity in both males <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and females. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Antiandrogens have mechanistic plausibility to work against SARS-CoV-2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> have demonstrated pre-clinical <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and preliminary clinical efficacy against COVID-19, both when used continuously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> or initiated during the course of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Proxalutamide is a second-generation non-steroidal antiandrogen (NSAA), primarily developed for castration-resistant prostate cancer, that demonstrated high potency as an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist. Proxalutamide also acts as a suppressor of AR gene expression and regulates the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have previously demonstrating that proxalutamide was effective to prevent hospitalization in COVID-19 male patients and to reduce viral shedding and inflammatory response, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have also demonstrated that proxalutamide was able to reduce mortality rate by 77.7&#x0025; in moderate-to-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients that were not on mechanical ventilation, and increased recovery speed by 128&#x0025;, when compared to placebo, also in a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT.</p>
<p>The efficacy of proxalutamide in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was demonstrated using intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis that did not require any type of adjustment. The unmodified ITT is the gold standard method of evaluation to demonstrate efficacy and is more conservative, since ITT analysis includes subjects that discontinued treatment.</p>
<p>Of the 645 patients enrolled in the trial, 65 discontinued or withdrew, including 29 of 317 subjects (9.1&#x0025;) of the proxalutamide arm and 36 of 328 subjects (11.0&#x0025;) of the placebo arm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> The 28-day mortality rate was overwhelmingly high among those that interrupted proxalutamide (79.3&#x0025; mortality rate - 23 out of 29 patients), while the mortality rate for those who interrupted placebo was 50.0&#x0025; (18 out of 36 patients),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> similar to the observed in the overall placebo arm. Importantly, placebo non-compliant patients exhibited similar mortality rate when compared to both overall placebo arm of the trial and in-hospital mortality in the same places where the trial was conducted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The intriguing high mortality of patients that did not complete the proxalutamide treatment led us to hypothesize that drug efficacy when used appropriately for 14 days could be different from the efficacy observed in ITT analysis. To evaluate those subjects that completed treatment or that died during treatment only, an on-treatment (OT) analysis would be recommended, although it may not allow conclusions regarding the actual drug efficacy.</p>
<p>The objective of the present <italic>post-hoc</italic> exploratory analysis is to evaluate the efficacy of proxalutamide in COVID-19 hospitalized patients when 14-day treatment is completed or uninterrupted until death, in case death occurs before 14 days of treatment. In addition, we describe the consequences in terms of outcomes of shorter duration proxalutamide treatment.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This is a <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis of a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective, two-arm RCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> describing the results of the RCT restricted to OT analysis, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., excluding patients that discontinued treatment before 14 days of drug treatment.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the trial design, sample size calculation, settings, recruitment, patient selection criteria, randomization, blinding, procedures and statistical analysis are published in another manuscript and detailed elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The trial was conducted at eight centers in six cities of the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Patients were recruited between February 1 and March 17, 2021. The RCT was registered in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT04728802), and approved by Brazilian National Ethics Committee (Approval number #4.513.425; CAAE: 41909121.0.0000.5553; Comit&#x00EA; de &#x00C9;tica em Pesquisa (CEP) of the Comit&#x00EA; Nacional de &#x00C9;tica em Pesquisa (CONEP) of the Ministry of Health (MS)) (CEP/CONEP/MS).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Selection criteria</title>
<p>Selection criteria included subjects hospitalized due to COVID-19, not in mechanical ventilation, with positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) (Roche, USA) for SARS-CoV-2 within seven days, and, upon randomization, without class III or IV congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), immunosuppression, baseline alanine transferase (ALT) above five times ULN (&#x003E; 250 U/L), creatinine above 2.5 mg/ml, and not currently using antiandrogen drugs, and, in case of women, not pregnant or planning to become pregnant within 90 days and nor breastfeeding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Patients were randomized to receive either proxalutamide 300 mg/day plus usual care or a placebo plus usual care, for 14 days, in a 1:1 ratio.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 8-point ordinal scale was used to determine disease severity. The scale was employed during screening (day 0), on a daily basis on days 1-14, day 21, and day 28. The clinical score was defined as: 8. Death; 7. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation; 6. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 5. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 4. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen-requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 3. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 2. Not hospitalized, limitation on activities; and 1. Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients discharged before the end of treatment continued the treatment at home until 14 days and were actively monitored for treatment compliance by daily phone calls. Participants discharged from the hospital were evaluated until day 28. Patients were instructed to contact or visit the same institution in case of relapse or new symptoms. Hospital readmissions were actively surveilled in all sites.</p>
<p>Baseline characteristics, previous medical history, and concomitant medications were recorded for each patient. Proxalutamide 300 mg/day (3 tablets of 100mg a day) or placebo (3 tablets a day) plus usual care was given for 14 days, even when COVID-19 remission occurred before this period. Usual care included medications such as enoxaparin, colchicine, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, or antibiotic therapy if necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>The primary outcome measure was the COVID-19 mortality rate at 28 days under OT analysis. The secondary endpoints included hospitalization length duration (days), the recovery rate, which was defined as achieving alive hospital discharge (scores 1 and 2) at day 14 and 28 under OT analysis. We also compared 28-day mortality rate between non-treatment completers of the proxalutamide <italic>versus</italic> placebo arm, as well as the differences between the present OT analysis and the ITT analysis, published elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Risk ratios (RR) and confidence interval (CI) were calculated for recovery and mortality rates, Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and CI for all-cause mortality at day 28, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for ordinal scale scores at 14 and 28 days, Kaplan-Meier&#x2019;s survivor function was used to evaluate and illustrate mortality and recovery rates over the 28 days after randomization. Statistical significance was defined as P&#x003C;0.05. Statistical analysis was performed in Stata/SE version 16.1 for Mac (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Reduction of mortality with the use of proxalutamide 300mg daily for 14 days in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was not-negligently higher in the OT analysis (95&#x0025; and 92&#x0025; reduction at days 14 and 28, respectively) than in the ITT (79&#x0025; and 78&#x0025; reduction at days 14 and 28, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> The differences between ITT and OT occurred because the 28-day mortality rate of treatment non-completers, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., patients that did not complete the 14-day proxalutamide treatment or that died at least 24 hours before interruption, was extremely high (79.3&#x0025;), and substantially higher than non-compliant patients that were receiving placebo (52.8&#x0025;) and fully-compliant that received proxalutamide (4.2&#x0025;). We hypothesized that the sudden and early interruption of proxalutamide may have led to an overcompensating relapse of COVID-19 and its complications. The mortality rate in non-treatment compliance subjects reinforces the antiviral and indirect protective mechanisms of action of proxalutamide, as a sort of proof-of-concept, since its early removal was mostly fatal for patients. This also raises concern regarding the importance to comply to the period of use of 14 days.</p>
<p>Despite the important differences between the OT and ITT analysis, the NNT of proxalutamide for hospitalized COVID-19 patients to prevent death was numerically similar between OT and ITT analysis, of 2.2 and 2.6, respectively. The interpretation of the results of proxalutamide as being highly effective to prevent deaths in moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients did not change between ITT and OT analyses.</p>
<p>This study has limitations inherent to <italic>post-hoc</italic> and retrospective analyses, although all the major barriers that could lead to confounding biases were addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> Unbalanced actives and placebo distribution across sites and minor protocol modifications were the major weaknesses of the present RCT, while the lack of any modification of the ITT analysis prevented additional biases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The major confounding factor in the present analysis is the causality relationship between interrupting of treatment with proxalutamide and apparent higher mortality rate. Initially, differences in the mortality rate observed between the OT and ITT analysis could be due to the fact that patients tend to discontinue treatment in case of lack of response. Since the mortality rate was substantially lower in the proxalutamide arm compared to the placebo arm, and the number of non-completers was similar between these groups, similar increases in mortality rate would represent a higher increase in terms of percentage in the group with lower mortality rate, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., in the active arm.</p>
<p>However, treatment non-compliance in the placebo arm was not associated to poorer response compared to completers of the placebo arm. Conversely, non-completers of the proxalutamide arm had higher mortality rate compared to completers of the same arm and to the placebo arm. This reinforces the hypothesis of potential harm caused by abrupt and early interruption of proxalutamide.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the male outpatient trial with proxalutamide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> the initial protocol was a 3-day treatment. However, after a few cases of disease relapse after the discontinuation, we increased the treatment duration to 7 days. In addition, in this trial, all 3 hospitalizations occur only after the end of the treatment with proxalutamide.</p>
<p>We reinforce the fact that the high mortality rate observed in non-compliance patients raised questions regarding the early interruption of proxalutamide, not only as an issue of no longer providing protection against SARS-CoV-2, but also the early discontinuation as being harmful and dangerous when duration of treatment is not respected. Since it is largely known that duration of a drug therapy is highly critical for its effects and outcomes, the comparisons between OT and ITT analysis and between early interruption of proxalutamide <italic>versus</italic> early interruption of placebo was necessary to highlight the importance of treatment duration with proxalutamide for moderate-to-severe COVID-19 explicit.</p>
<p>In addition to the message that the actual reduction of mortality rate with proxalutamide when treatment was fully complied is 92&#x0025;, the present work also conveys the message that further trials with proxalutamide must include in their consent form that a potential increased risk of mortality if treatment is interrupted before the proposed period of 14 days. This warning is of great ethics importance and is made necessary for any future study on the drug. Ongoing trials should consider amending their consent forms, warn enrolled patients of these potential increased risk of mortality, and ethics committees should be informed of this new finding for our RCT.</p>
