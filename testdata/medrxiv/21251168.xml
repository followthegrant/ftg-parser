<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The emergence of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant called lineage B.1.1.7 sparked global alarm due to evidence of increased transmissibility, mortality, and uncertainty about vaccine efficacy, thus accelerating efforts to detect and track the variant. Current approaches to detect lineage B.1.1.7 include sequencing and RT-qPCR tests containing a target assay that fails or results in reduced sensitivity towards the B.1.1.7 variant. Since many countries lack robust genomic surveillance programs and failed assays detect multiple unrelated variants containing similar mutations as B.1.1.7, we sought to develop an RT-qPCR test that can accurately and rapidly differentiate the B.1.1.7 variant from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. We used bioinformatics, allele-specific PCR, and judicious placement of LNA-modified nucleotides to develop a test that differentiates B.1.1.7 from other SARS-CoV-2 variants. We validated the test on 106 clinical samples with lineage status confirmed by sequencing. Our room temperature-stable, multiplexed RT-qPCR test consists of two assays that target either the common SARS-CoV-2 spike gene or spike gene deletions specific to lineage B.1.1.7. A simple relative comparison of the Ct values of the two assays permits not only identification of the B.1.1.7 variant but also its differentiation from other variants that harbor only the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion.The test showed 97&#x0025; clinical sensitivity at detecting lineage B.1.1.7. This test can easily be implemented in labs to rapidly scale B.1.1.7 surveillance efforts and is particularly useful in countries with high prevalence of variants possessing only the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion because current strategies using target failure assays incorrectly identify these as putative B.1.1.7 variants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In Dec 2020, Rambaut et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] reported the genomic characterization of a distinct phylogenetic cluster named lineage B.1.1.7, also referred to as 20I/501Y.V1 by Nextstrain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2/">https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2/</ext-link>) or Variant of Concern (VOC) 202012/01, briskly spreading over the past four weeks in the United Kingdom. The new lineage has 23 mutations: 13 non-synonymous mutations, 4 deletions, and 6 synonymous mutations. The spike protein contains ten mutations at the amino-acid level (&#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144 deletions, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H) that could potentially change binding affinity of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] and consequently virus-host interaction. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests lineage B.1.1.7 has enhanced transmissibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], results in higher viral loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], and causes increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. These data highlight the need for tools to facilitate enhanced surveillance of lineage B.1.1.7 as well as other variants that may harbour spike gene mutations that alter viral dynamics.</p>
<p>The dominant approach used to putatively detect lineage B.1.1.7 involves conducting multigene RT-qPCR tests that result in positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in one or more gene sets together with a so-called S gene target failure (SGTF), which is used as a proxy for the B.1.1.7 variant. This approach permits widespread, rapid screening, but is limited by the fact that other variants, in addition to the lineage B.1.1.7, produce SGTFs. Thus, the SGTF screening method depends on the presence of other variants in a region and how they vary over time. The gold-standard for detection of the B.1.1.7 variant is through whole genome sequencing. This provides direct confirmation of the variant and identification of emerging variants; however, it is expensive, time consuming, low throughput, and many countries lack a robust genomic surveillance program, making this approach unwieldy to adopt for mitigating the spread of the B.1.1.7 variant.</p>
<p>Here, we report for the first time, the development of a novel, room temperature-stable, and multiplexed RT-qPCR test for differentiating lineage B.1.1.7 from all other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. The assay has been validated on clinical samples verified by sequencing to be positive for lineage B.1.1.7. Unlike other tests that rely on indirect detection via SGTF, this test contains primers that target the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144 deletions in the spike gene that permit the direct detection of lineage B.1.1.7. This RT-qPCR assay will provide a useful tool for countries to rapidly identify hot spots of this new B.1.1.7 variant and implement test, trace, and isolate strategies to prevent this variant from becoming widespread. This test would be particularly useful in countries currently experiencing extensive circulation of variants carrying only the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion as these would be via SGTF falsely identified as the B.1.1.7 variant.</p>

<title>Analysis of sequences</title>
<p>To identify suitable targets for primer/probe design, we downloaded 1,136 sequences from the GISAID repository filtered during a collection time spanning 1 - 21 December 2020. We focused on the spike gene because lineage B.1.1.7 contains a number of spike gene mutations, including two deletions (&#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144) that are ideal for designing a specific assay. We cut the locus encoding the spike protein and used the MAFFT alignment tool (with the parameter - auto)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] to align all the sequences against the WUHAN reference (NCBI ID: NC_045512.2). Twelve sequences (1.06 &#x0025;) contained ambiguous signal in the loci of deletions and were not used in the downstream analysis. We separated sequences into two groups: 1) those with the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144 deletions and 2) those without the deletions (<bold><xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S1</xref></bold>). Using SeaView [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], we called 95&#x0025; consensus sequences for the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144 group and the No deletions group that were subsequently used to design primer and probe sets specific to either B.1.1.7 or all other SARS-CoV-2 variants, respectively.</p>
<p>In a separate analysis to determine the prevalence of the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144 deletions in lineages other than B.1.1.7, we downloaded 416,778 spike protein sequences with the most recent data description file collected from the beginning of the pandemic through 29 January 2021. Using regular expressions (bash pattern matching command grep with the option -P for Perl-compatible regular expression), we searched for loci with both &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144 deletions and for loci without these deletions. In the regular expression, we kept fixed a few amino acids downstream and upstream from the deletions to omit any miscalling of the searched pattern. All commands and scripts will be available here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MultiplexDX/B117-RT-qPCR-design">https://github.com/MultiplexDX/B117-RT-qPCR-design</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Primer design and synthesis</title>
<p>We designed primers and probes using the 95&#x0025; consensus sequences to target the S gene of the common SARS-CoV-2 (called SARS-CoV-2 S gene assay). To differentiate the B.1.1.7 variant from all other SARS-CoV-2 variants, we also designed primers and probes to target the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 variants containing either the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion or the &#x0394;Y144 deletion, or both deletions (called B.1.1.7 assay). As an internal control, we synthesized a primer/probe set for human RNase P published by the US CDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. We incorporated locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified bases into some primers and probes following general guidelines in order to normalize melting temperatures, increase sensitivity, and enhance specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Following primer/probe design, we conducted <italic>in silico</italic> analyses using the IDT OligoAnalyzer&#x2122; tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.idtdna.com/pages/tools/oligoanalyzer">https://www.idtdna.com/pages/tools/oligoanalyzer</ext-link>) to verify melting temperature (Tm), GC content, and potential to form homo-/hetero-dimers as well as the mFold server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/">http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/</ext-link>) to identify problematic secondary structures or necessary hairpin formation for TaqMan probes. Probes for both SARS-CoV-2 S gene and B.1.1.7 were labelled with a 5&#x2019;-FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) reporter dye and 3&#x2019;-BHQ-1 (black hole quencher 1) dye.

<title>Positive controls and clinical samples</title>
<p>For primer/probe set optimization, we used the following positive controls: 1) RNA extracted from a patient confirmed positive for a common variant of SARS-CoV-2 that does not contain any deletions in the spike gene (named wild type template), 2) RNA extracted from a patient confirmed positive for a common variant of SARS-CoV-2 that contains the six base pair deletion (bp: 21765-21770) resulting in the deletion of two amino acids at the 69/70 position of the spike protein (named &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 template), and 3) RNA extracted from a patient confirmed positive by whole genome sequencing for the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 (named B.1.1.7 template).

<p>We optimized RT-qPCR reactions and conducted clinical validations using both an AriaMx (Agilent, CA, USA) and QuantSudio 5 (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA) real-time PCR system. For all the detected genes, we used the SOLIScript&#x00AE; 1-step CoV Kit (Cat.

One-step RT-qPCR assays were conducted with the following cycling conditions: 55 &#x00B0;C for 10 min for reverse transcription, 95 &#x00B0;C for 10 min for initial denaturation, and 45 cycles of 95 &#x00B0;C for 15 s and 60 &#x00B0;C for 30 s. Concentrations for primers and probes were as follows: SARS-CoV-2 S gene (forward and reverse primer &#x003D; 500 nM, probes &#x003D; 200 nM for each probe (single and dual); B.1.1.7: forward primer &#x003D; 600 nM, reverse primer &#x003D; 800 nM, probes &#x003D; 200 nM for each probe (single and dual); RNase P (forward and reverse primer &#x003D; 250 nM, probe &#x003D; 80 nM).</p>

<p>To assess the analytical sensitivity of both our common SARS-CoV-2 S gene (S gene) and B.1.1.7 primer/probe sets, we used RNA isolated from a patient sample infected with the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 as confirmed by sequencing. This RNA was diluted to 200 copies/&#x03BC;l and then serial dilutions were prepared by diluting the stock with a synthetic matrix &#x201C;SARS-CoV-2 Negative&#x201D; (Cat.

<title>Clinical performance evaluation</title>
<p>We evaluated the clinical utility of our SARS-CoV-2 S gene and B.1.1.7 primer/probe sets using a selected set of 65 SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples, which were confirmed by a reference method used for routine testing by regional public health authorities of the Slovak Republic. Further sequencing revealed 37 of these samples belonging to the B.1.1.7 lineage. The SARS-CoV-2 sequences were determined by sequencing of tiled &#x223C; 2-kbp long amplicons on a MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) as described by Resende et al.

<title>Analysis of sequences</title>
<p>Our analysis of 1,136 spike gene sequences (spanning 1 - 21 December 2020) revealed 228 sequences (20&#x0025;) that contained both the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144 deletions (for country of origin, see <bold><xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S1</xref></bold>). The shorter deletion (&#x0394;Y144) always co-occurred with the longer deletion (&#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70), whereas the (&#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70) deletion occurs independently in 17 sequences (1.5&#x0025;). Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficient of the deletions is 0.953.</p>
<p>Analysis of the prevalence of both &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144 deletions in lineages other than B.1.1.7 revealed a total of 29,872 sequences that possess both deletions, while 368,474 sequences do not have them. Based on the metadata file, we identified SARS-CoV-2 lineages across all called sequences with both deletions. Only five sequences (0.0167&#x0025;) out of 29,872 records are not labelled as B.1.1.7. In other words, 99.98&#x0025; of sequences containing both deletions belong to lineage B.1.1.7, highlighting the notion that these two deletions are highly specific for the B.1.1.7 variant and make ideal targets for primer/probe design.</p>

<title>Optimization of a S gene primer/probe set targeting both common SARS-CoV-2 and &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion variants</title>
<p>We began by designing a general S gene primer/probe assay (SARS-CoV-2 S gene) that could be used for screening purposes and would detect the most common strains of SARS-CoV-2 as well as variants containing the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70, including lineage B.1.1.7 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). We designed a series of primers flanking the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion and tested their performance during RT-qPCR using the wild type and &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 templates (for primer/probes sequences, see <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S2</xref>.</bold>).

<title>Optimization of a S gene primer/probe set capable of differentiating between lineage B.1.1.7 and other SARS-CoV-2 variants</title>
<p>Lineage B.1.1.7 contains two deletions in the spike gene, including a six base pair deletion (bp: 21765-21770; &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70) and three base pair deletion (bp: 21991-21993; &#x0394;Y144). Since the co-occurrence of these deletions is highly specific to B.1.1.7 (99.98&#x0025;), we selected these deletions as candidate regions to target for a primer/probe set to differentiate B.1.1.7 from all other SARS-CoV-2 variants (see <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold> for primer/probe location and <bold><xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S2</xref></bold> for primer and probe sequences). Our first approach consisted of designing several probes targeting the first deletion and determining specificity by conducting RT-qPCR using the forward and reverse primers from our SARS-CoV-2 S gene set (F1 and R1) to amplify both wild type and &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 templates; however, none of the probes were capable of discriminating between wild type and &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 templates, even though all probes were less efficient at detecting wild type template (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). We then attempted to differentiate wild type template from &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 template by designing several forward primers targeting the span of the six base pair deletion. We tested these forward primers using the same probe and reverse primer from our SARS-CoV-2 S gene set (P3 and R1) and found two forward primers (F2 and F3) that specifically amplified only &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 template (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). We selected F3 instead of F2 for further assay development based on its sensitivity to &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 templates, fluorescence intensity, and profile of the amplification curve.</p>

</fig>
<p>Since other SARS-CoV-2 variants share the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion (e.g., B.1.1.298, B.1.160, B.1.177, B.1.258, B.1.375), we next sought to design a series of reverse primers to target the second, three base pair deletion (bp: 21991-21993; &#x0394;Y144). This approach would facilitate differentiating B.1.1.7 variants that contain both the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144 deletions from SARS-CoV-2 variants that contain only the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion. To increase the specificity of the assay, we also utilized allele-specific PCR approaches. We introduced selective mismatch bases in the 3&#x2019;-end of the primer to destabilize base complementary to sequences that lack the &#x0394;Y144 deletion, while retaining complementarity in sequences containing the &#x0394;Y144 deletion such as B.1.1.7 variants. We designed a series of reverse primers spanning the three base pair deletion (bp: 21991-21993; &#x0394;Y144) with and without LNA-modified oligos to modify stability and tested the ability of these primer/probe sets to amplify three templates: wild type, &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70, and B.1.1.7. While our 3&#x2019;-LNA-modified primers (R1-R6) were unable to differentiate between B.1.1.7 and &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70, several unmodified primers displayed reduced sensitivity towards &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 with a Ct value difference greater than nine when compared with Ct values of B.1.1.7, demonstrating their capability to differentiate the two variants (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). These primers also showed minimal reductions in sensitivity when compared to Ct values of B.1.1.7 template amplified using SARS-CoV-2 S gene set (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). This data strongly suggests that the change in Ct value (&#x0394;Ct), that is to say, the relative difference in Ct values between the B.1.1.7 and SARS-CoV-2 S gene assays, could be used to confirm the presence of B.1.1.7 when the &#x0394;Ct value is minimal (e.g., &#x0394;Ct &#x2264; 5). Alternatively, a larger change in Ct values (e.g., &#x0394;Ct &#x2265; 8) could indicate the presence of a variant that contains the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion, but not the &#x0394;Y144 deletion.</p>
<p>We also attempted another approach by substituting a mismatched base in the 3&#x2019;-end of the reverse primer to form a non-canonical base pair that would further destabilize 3&#x2019;-end complementarity to a greater degree in templates that lack the &#x0394;Y144 deletion, a technique which can be useful for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. These primers (R28-R37) showed the highest specificity with &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 template amplifying over eight cycles later than B.1.1.7 template (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). Although some of these reverse primers (R33-35) showed reduced sensitivity when compared to B.1.1.7 template amplified with our common SARS-CoV-2 S gene, we found that judicious placement of an LNA-modified thymine (LNA-T) towards the 3&#x2019;-end mismatch retained high sensitivity (e.g., R36). This benefit had a limit, however, as placing the LNA-T too close to the mismatch was detrimental to sensitivity (R37; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). Taken together, several of these primers are capable of discriminating between B.1.1.7 and other variants containing the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion, provided that a second reaction is ran in parallel using the SARS-CoV-2 S gene set that can be used as a benchmark to assess the relative sensitivity. If the B.1.1.7 primer set amplifies the sample within five Ct cycles of the SARS-CoV-2 S gene primer set, then the sample is B.1.1.7 positive. Alternatively, if the B.1.1.7 primer set amplifies the sample in 8 or more Ct cycles relative to the SARS-CoV-2 S gene primer set, than the sample likely belongs to a variant that contains the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion, but not the &#x0394;Y144 deletion, and hence is B.1.1.7 negative.</p>

<title>Comparison of B.1.1.7 S gene primer/probe sets</title>
<p>Following the clinical validation, we compared three different versions of B.1.1.7 primer/probe sets that varied according to the reverse primer (V1, V2, and V3 use reverse primers R14, R23, and R36, respectively) using a selected set of 46 samples, some of which were sequenced to confirm lineage status. Given our interpretation criterion (<bold><xref rid="tblS4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S4</xref></bold>), we determined that the V3 primer/probe set (F3-P3-P4-R36) performed the best since it correctly identified all B.1.1.7 and &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion samples, with the exception of one &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion sample that was interpreted as inconclusive (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). While V1 and V2 primer/probe sets correctly identified all B.1.1.7 samples, they performed poorly at calling &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion samples. V1 correctly identified only 11 samples, whereas V2 performed better by correctly identifying 30 samples. Sequencing results on all B.1.1.7 samples and a subset (n=12) of &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion samples confirmed their lineage designation. Among the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion samples that were sequenced, the V1, V2, and V3 primer/probes sets detected 25&#x0025;, 67&#x0025;, and 92&#x0025;, respectively, of the samples identified as lineage B.1.258, thus confirming V3 as the most suitable primer/probe combination to identify other lineages containing only the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion.</p>

The &#x0394;Ct of this sample was slightly greater than five cycles (e.g., Sample 40, &#x0394;Ct &#x003D; 5.7) relative to the Ct value for the SARS-CoV-2 S gene assay, which exceeded our cut-off for a positive identification (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Notably, our assay was also capable of identifying samples carrying the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion such as those belonging to the B.1.258 lineage, provided that the sample contains sufficient viral load as other &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 variants yield &#x0394;Ct values greater than 8 Ct cycles. For the 24 samples that carry only the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion and belong to lineage B.1.258, our B.1.1.7 assay correctly identified 20 out of 24 samples. Three samples were not detected by the B.1.1.7 assay possibly due to relatively high Ct values in the SARS-CoV-2 S gene assay for two samples (Sample 33, Ct &#x003D; 30.1 and Sample 65, Ct &#x003D; 28.9), making confirmation of the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 status impossible with our cut-off criterion. One sample had a &#x0394;Ct outside the criterion for &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion confirmation and was deemed inconclusive. Detection of human RNase P showed high homogeneity in all analysed samples, confirming the suitability of this assay as an internal control for collection and RNA extraction from a clinical sample (data not shown). Overall, the clinical evaluation confirmed the diagnostic utility of both our SARS-CoV-2 S gene and B.1.1.7 assays, which showed 100&#x0025; (106/106) and 97&#x0025; (65/67) diagnostic sensitivity, respectively. The assay also showed diagnostic utility for identifying variants containing only the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion by detecting 83.3&#x0025; (20/24) of lineage B.1.258 samples. When considering B.1.258 samples containing high viral loads (Ct &#x2264; 28), which is necessary to identify variants with only the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion, the diagnostic sensitivity reached 91.7&#x0025; (22/24).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The recent emergence of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant called lineage B.1.1.7 has sparked global consternation as it has now been confirmed in over 70 countries and threatens to exacerbate an already dire pandemic. To mitigate the spread of the B.1.1.7 variant, it is imperative that countries have diagnostic tools that can quickly and accurately detect and track the prevalence of the variant in order to implement the appropriate epidemiological measures. Here we report a novel RT-qPCR test to differentiate the B.1.1.7 variant from other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. The test consists of running two S gene target assays, one specific for B.1.1.7 and the other for all SARS-CoV-2 strains, and performing a simple comparison of relative Ct values that allows the user to differentiate the B.1.1.7 variant from other variants that have the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion. We validated this test on clinical samples that were sequenced to determine the exact SARS-CoV-2 lineage and the results demonstrated a high level of sensitivity in distinguishing the B.1.1.7. variant. This RT-qPCR test provides a positive identification of the B.1.1.7 variant, providing countries with a powerful tool to detect and track lineage B.1.1.7, especially countries that have considerable prevalence of variants carrying only the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], which are mistakenly identified as B.1.1.7 variants by currently used SGTF assays.</p>
<p>Although there are hundreds of approved RT-qPCR tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, none of them are capable of directly differentiating the B.1.1.7 variant from common variants of SARS-CoV-2. Paradoxically, failed RT-qPCR tests have been instrumental in identifying putative B.1.1.7 positive samples and tracking its prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. These RT-qPCR tests contain multigene assays, with at least one assay targeting the spike gene, and during routine testing a &#x201C;drop-out&#x201D; in the spike gene assay may occur, while other gene targets yield positive signals. This SGTF can indicate the presence of the B.1.1.7 variant and flag samples for confirmation by sequencing. It is important to note, however, SGTPs are produced by other variants that contain the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion, including the B.1.1, B1.258, and the mink cluster V (B.1.1.298) lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. This highlights the importance of follow up sequencing of SGTF samples to determine lineage status.</p>
<p>Indeed, an analysis of SGTFs and corresponding sequencing data by Public Health England revealed that SGTF assays were poor proxies for the presence of B.1.1.7 in early October with only 3&#x0025; of SGTFs assays positively identifying a B.1.1.7 variant. The SGTF assays only became useful proxies when the variant spread and became more dominant in late November when the assays then detected over 90&#x0025; of the variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Volz and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] reached a similar conclusion, suggesting that the success of SGTF assays depends on the location, time, and frequency of other variants that contain the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion. This is particularly problematic, since the SGTF assays are the least accurate at the time when the B.1.1.7 variant is at low prevalence, precisely the time when an accurate test is needed most in order to establish effective mitigation strategies. Our test outlined here makes significant strides in this effort by accurately differentiating the B.1.1.7 variant with a test that does not rely on a SGTF, thus providing a rapid, accurate test that eliminates the need to conduct expensive and laborious sequencing to confirm lineage status.</p>
<p>Besides the SGTF tests, two recent preprint papers from the same group describe a deep learning approach that was used to design two primer/probe sets targeting a synonymous mutation C16176T in the ORF1a gene or a nonsynonymous mutation in the spike gene (S982A) that were found to be specific to the B.1.1.7 variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. However, the primer design raises questions because both mutations in the ORF1a and S genes appear in the middle of the respective forward primers, making it unlikely that either primer set would specifically amplify only the B.1.1.7 variant, since discrimination of SNPs generally requires the mutated base to be located near the 3&#x2019;-terminal to inhibit extension by the polymerase. Also, the primer sets were only validated <italic>in silico</italic> so it is critical to assess their performance and specificity on clinical samples that have been verified by sequencing. Our approach targeted both the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144 deletions in the spike gene with the 3&#x2019;-end of both forward and reverse primers spanning the region of the deletions. We also leveraged allele-specific PCR approaches where we introduced a mismatch base that resulted in enhanced differentiation of the B.1.1.7 variant from other &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 variants, effectively allowing one to discriminate between B.1.1.7, other &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 variants, and the common SARS-CoV-2 in one test. As a testament to the specificity of this assay, our analysis of all GISAID sequences containing both the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144 deletions revealed that a staggering 99.98&#x0025; of all these sequences belong to lineage B.1.1.7, ensuring that users can have high confidence that a positive B.1.1.7 assay result is a true positive.</p>
<p>The Grubaugh lab developed another test using primers that flanked both the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 and &#x0394;Y144 deletions and two different probes to mimic the S gene &#x201C;drop-out&#x201D; assay and permit a B.1.1.7 &#x201C;detection&#x201D; assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. While the S gene &#x201C;drop-out&#x201D; assay successfully detected B.1.1.7 and other &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 variants, the &#x201C;detection&#x201D; assay failed to distinguish between B.1.1.7, &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 variants, and common SARS-CoV-2 variants. In essence, they created an open-source version of the SGTF RT-qPCR test that could be used for screening purposes. In an updated protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], they also multiplex their S gene drop-out assay with another drop out primer/probe set that targets the &#x0394;3675-3677 SGF deletion in the ORF1a gene observed in B.1.1.7 and both the B.1.351 and P.1 variants recently detected in South Africa and Brazil. By combining these primer/probe sets with the CDC N1 primer/probe set, the user can putatively differentiate B.1.1.7 from B.1.351 and P.1 as well as variants containing only the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion, providing a unique assay to screen for these emerging variants. While the B.1.351 and P.1 assay remains to be validated on clinical samples, the test still relies on target gene failures and therefore retains the limitations for SGTF assays and necessity to confirm lineage status by sequencing.</p>
<p>To differentiate B.1.1.7, we took an alternative approach by targeting the &#x0394;Y144 deletion using allele-specific PCR methods combined with judicious placement of LNA oligonucleotides. This allowed us to stabilize the 5&#x2019;-end and mismatched base, and to shorten the 3&#x2019;-terminal of the reverse primer. Together, these modifications provided us with a primer/probe set that retained specificity for B.1.1.7 variants and reduced specificity to other variants containing the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion. Our test, instead of relying on target failures to identify putative variants, provides a positive signal in the presence of B.1.1.7 and &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion variants that can easily be differentiated by comparing their relative Ct values to a common SARS-CoV-2 S gene primer/probe set that serves as a benchmark.</p>
<p>We have provided interested users with the primer and probe sequences to implement this B.1.1.7 assay in their own laboratories with the hope this can rapidly scale the ability of countries to identify the B.1.1.7 variant and implement epidemiological measures to mitigate its spread. This test is also available as a research use only kit called rTest COVID-19 B.1.1.7 qPCR kit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.multiplexdx.com/products/rtest-covid-19-b-1-1-7-qpcr-kit">https://www.multiplexdx.com/products/rtest-covid-19-b-1-1-7-qpcr-kit</ext-link>, MultiplexDX,</p>
<p>Inc., Bratislava, Slovakia) that contains lyophilized SARS-CoV-2 S gene and B.1.1.7 primer/probe sets both multiplexed with human RNase P (200 reactions per assay) and a lyophilized positive control containing B.1.1.7 RNA spiked with human RNA that can be used to validate all primer/probe sets. The kit utilizes the room temperature-stable SOLIScript&#x00AE; 1-step CoV Kit (SolisBiodyne) and laboratory tests show that all kit components are stable for at least one month at room temperature, eliminating cold chain shipping/storage and freeing valuable freezer storage space (e.g., for storage of mRNA-based vaccines). This test can provide labs with a powerful tool to directly confirm the presence of the B.1.1.7 variant in a sample previously determined SARS-CoV-2 positive by an approved screening test, thus avoiding the use of target gene failure assays that can be plagued with low specificity and obviating the need to conduct burdensome and costly genomic sequencing. This is particularly important for countries that are experiencing extensive circulation of variants harbouring only the &#x0394;H69/&#x0394;V70 deletion as current RT-qPCR assays that rely on SGTFs erroneously classify these samples as presumptive B.1.1.7 variants.</p>
