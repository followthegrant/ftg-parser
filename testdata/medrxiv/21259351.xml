<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Heparin, in addition to its anticoagulant properties, has anti-inflammatory and potential anti-viral effects, and may improve endothelial function in patients with Covid-19. Early initiation of therapeutic heparin could decrease the thrombo-inflammatory process, and reduce the risk of critical illness or death.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We randomly assigned moderately ill hospitalized ward patients admitted for Covid-19 with elevated D-dimer level to therapeutic or prophylactic heparin. The primary outcome was a composite of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation or ICU admission. Safety outcomes included major bleeding. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>At 28 days, the primary composite outcome occurred in 37 of 228 patients (16.2&#x0025;) assigned to therapeutic heparin, and 52 of 237 patients (21.9&#x0025;) assigned to prophylactic heparin (odds ratio, 0.69; 95&#x0025; confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 1.10; p=0.12). Four patients (1.8&#x0025;) assigned to therapeutic heparin died compared with 18 patients (7.6&#x0025;) assigned to prophylactic heparin (odds ratio, 0.22; 95&#x0025;-CI, 0.07 to 0.65). The composite of all-cause mortality or any mechanical ventilation occurred in 23 (10.1&#x0025;) in the therapeutic heparin group and 38 (16.0&#x0025;) in the prophylactic heparin group (odds ratio, 0.59; 95&#x0025;-CI, 0.34 to 1.02). Major bleeding occurred in 2 patients (0.9&#x0025;) with therapeutic heparin and 4 patients (1.7&#x0025;) with prophylactic heparin (odds ratio, 0.52; 95&#x0025;-CI, 0.09 to 2.85).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In moderately ill ward patients with Covid-19 and elevated D-dimer level, therapeutic heparin did not significantly reduce the primary outcome but decreased the odds of death at 28 days.</p>

<p>The most common cause of clinical deterioration of patients hospitalized for Covid-19 is hypoxic respiratory failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Pulmonary vascular dysfunction and microvascular thrombosis likely contribute to respiratory compromise,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> which in turn may be caused by a thrombo-inflammatory state also referred to as Covid-19 coagulopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Elevated D-dimer levels, as marker of coagulopathy, and hypoxia are associated with poor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Heparin, in addition to its anticoagulant properties, has anti-inflammatory and potential anti-viral effects, and may improve endothelial function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Early initiation of therapeutic heparin could therefore decrease the thrombo-inflammatory process, and reduce the risk of critical illness or death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Randomized trials indicated that therapeutic heparin anticoagulation therefore may be beneficial in moderately,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> but not critically ill<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> patients with Covid-19, suggesting that the time of initiation of therapeutic heparin is indeed important. The Therapeutic Anticoagulation versus Standard Care as a Rapid Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic (RAPID) trial was designed to determine if therapeutic heparin is superior to prophylactic heparin in moderately ill ward patients with Covid-19 and elevated D-dimer level in decreasing the composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or death.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Trial Design and Oversight</title>
<p>The RAPID trial was an investigator-initiated, parallel, pragmatic, adaptive multi-center, open-label randomized controlled trial conducted at 28 sites in 6 countries. For administrative reasons, the protocol in Brazil was registered separately, but prospectively harmonized (see Supplementary Appendix). The trial was designed by the co-principal investigators and supported by St. Michael&#x2019;s Hospital Foundation and the Canadian Institute for Military and Veteran Health Research and multiple participating hospitals (see Supplementary Appendix).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> The funders had no role in trial design, conduct, collection, management, analysis or interpretation of data, or in preparation or review of the manuscript or the approval of the manuscript for submission. An independent data and safety monitoring board oversaw the trial (see Supplementary Appendix). Authorized research ethics committees approved the trial at all participating sites. The authors vouch for completeness and accuracy of the data and the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Patients were eligible if they were admitted to hospital wards for Covid-19 with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and elevated D-dimer levels within the first 5 days of admission. D-dimer levels were required to be above the upper limit of normal (ULN) of the local hospital in the presence of an oxygen saturation &#x2264;93&#x0025; on room air, or &#x2265;2 times the ULN irrespective of oxygen saturation. Participants were excluded if they had substantial bleeding risks, an absolute indication for or any contraindication against heparin anticoagulation based on care team judgment, were pregnant or if they had already met, or would imminently meet any component of the primary outcome. Full eligibility criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal representatives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Randomization and Interventions</title>
<p>We used web-based central randomization with a computer-generated random sequence with variable block sizes stratified by site and age (&#x2264;65 versus &#x003E;65 years) to assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to therapeutic or prophylactic heparin. Patients allocated to therapeutic heparin received therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH), patients allocated to prophylactic heparin received dose-capped prophylactic subcutaneous heparin (LMWH or UFH) adjusted for body mass index and creatinine clearance (see Supplementary Appendix for dosing).</p>
<p>Study treatment was started within 24 hours after randomization, and continued until the first of hospital discharge, day 28, study withdrawal or death (Fig. S1). If a participant was admitted to ICU, continuation of the allocated treatment was recommended.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Outcomes and Follow-up</title>
<p>The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission, non-invasive (bilevel or continuous positive airway pressure) or invasive mechanical ventilation, or death up to 28 days. Secondary outcomes included all-cause death; the composite of any mechanical ventilation or all-cause death; ICU admission or all-cause death; ventilator-free days alive; organ support-free days alive; ICU-free days alive; hospital-free days alive (see Supplementary Appendix); renal replacement therapy; venous thromboembolism; arterial thromboembolism; and D-dimer level at 2 days &#x00B1; 24 hours post-randomization (see Supplementary Appendix for detailed definitions). The following components of the primary composite were not included in the protocol, but pre-specified as secondary outcomes in the statistical analysis plan: invasive mechanical ventilation; composite of invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation; ICU admission. Pre-specified safety outcomes included: major bleeding as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> red blood cell transfusion (&#x2265;1 unit); transfusion of hemostatic blood components or products; and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. An independent event-adjudication committee, which consisted of clinicians who were unaware of the treatment assignments, adjudicated the components of the primary outcome, bleeding and thrombotic events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We estimated that 231 patients per group would provide 90&#x0025; power to detect a 15&#x0025; absolute risk difference, from 50&#x0025; in the control group to 35&#x0025; in the experimental group, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.048 accounting for two planned interim analyses at 25&#x0025; and 75&#x0025; of the originally planned sample size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> At 75&#x0025;, we performed a conditional power analysis. The protocol pre-specified that the sample size would be increased if the conditional power was between 60 and 80&#x0025;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> As the conditional power was below 60&#x0025;, the data safety and monitoring board recommended not to increase the sample size and complete recruitment as originally planned.</p>
<p>The primary analysis of the primary composite outcome was based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle using logistic regression; a Chi-squared test of independence was conducted to obtain the two-sided p-value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Participants who did not have a 28-day assessment, but discharged from hospital alive prior to day 28, were assumed to be event-free up to day 28. Pre-specified subgroup analyses of the primary outcome accompanied by tests of interaction were done for age, sex, body mass index, time from Covid-19 symptom onset, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and race/ethnicity, D-dimer level, use of systemic corticosteroid and geographical region. Pre-specified sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome excluded participants who did not have a 28-day assessment, and included only participants from the per-protocol cohort. The per-protocol cohort was all eligible participants who received their intervention as randomly allocated during the first 48 hours after randomization, and excluded participants who did not satisfy all eligibility criteria, did not receive their allocated treatment or did not have follow-up until day 28, death, or other primary composite outcome component. Since randomization was stratified by age an additional logistic regression model was fit to analyse the primary outcome controlling for age.</p>
<p>Binary secondary outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression. Ventilator-free days, organ support-free days, ICU-free days and hospital-free days alive were analysed using ordinal logistic regression; death up to 28 days was assigned the worst outcome (a value of &#x2212;1) in these analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> The post-treatment D-dimer was compared using linear regression adjusted for baseline. Since D-dimer assays differed across sites, D-dimer levels were analyzed as the logarithm of D-dimer x ULN by taking the natural logarithm of the ratio of the actual d-dimer value divided by the ULN for the assay used. Analyses of secondary outcomes were considered exploratory so were not adjusted for multiple comparisons; the widths of 95&#x0025; confidence intervals for secondary outcomes should not be used for inferences about treatment effects. An extended description of the statistical methods is provided in the Supplementary Appendix.</p>
<p>Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect meta-analyses of odds ratios were done for outcomes reported in available trials of therapeutic heparin compared with usual care using lower doses of heparin in hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Organ support-free days in the RAPID trial were recalculated for an observation time of 21 days, in accordance with the primary outcome definition used in the other trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Analyses were done separately for moderately ill ward patients and severely ill ICU patients, using a chi-squared test to estimate p-values for interaction between treatment and severity of illness. The variance attributed to pooled results reflects only sampling error due to the play of chance at randomization. Homogeneity of odds ratios is not required for fixed-effect pooled odds ratios to be informative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup></p>

<p>The mean age was 60 years; 264 participants (56.8&#x0025;) were men and the mean body mass index was 30.3. Baseline D-dimer was 2.3-fold above the ULN and mean creatinine was 85.2 &#x00B5;mol/L. Six patients in the therapeutic and five in the prophylactic heparin group had D-dimer levels below the ULN at baseline. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between treatment arms (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The mean duration from symptom onset to hospitalization was 7.1 days, and the mean duration from hospitalization to randomization was 1.4 days. The mean treatment duration was 6.5 and 6.3 days in therapeutic and prophylactic heparin groups, respectively (Table S1). LMWH was prescribed in 224 (98.2&#x0025;) of patients assigned to therapeutic and 222 (93.7&#x0025;) patients assigned to prophylactic heparin. Concomitant treatments (systemic corticosteroids, remdesivir, and tocilizumab) were balanced between treatment arms for pre- and post-randomization periods combined (Table S2).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this randomized trial of moderately ill hospitalized ward patients with Covid-19 and elevated D-dimer levels, therapeutic heparin did not lower the incidence of the primary composite of death, mechanical ventilation or ICU admission compared with prophylactic heparin. The odds of all-cause death were significantly reduced by 78&#x0025; with therapeutic heparin, however. Between-group differences were smaller and nonsignificant for mechanical ventilation and ICU admission.</p>
<p>A meta-analysis of the two available trials of therapeutic heparin in moderately ill ward patients with Covid-19 did not provide conclusive evidence for a reduction in mortality with therapeutic heparin, with a larger mortality reduction in RAPID than in the multiplatform trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Findings for remaining effectiveness outcomes were consistent between trials, with significant differences in favour of therapeutic heparin. Three effectiveness outcomes were also reported in a separate multiplatform trial in severely ill patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> We found significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions with severity of illness for all-cause death, all-cause death or major thrombosis and organ-support-free days alive, with evidence of benefit with therapeutic heparin in moderately ill ward patients, but not in severely ill ICU patients. Conversely, there were no treatment by subgroup interactions for major thrombotic events and major bleeding, with consistent benefit of therapeutic heparin for major thrombotic events, and non-significant small increases in major bleeding irrespective of illness severity. Both, the multiplatform trial and RAPID used D-dimer levels for risk stratification of ward patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> but results of the multiplatform trial indicate that D-dimer status does not result in variation of treatment effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Taken together, these trials provide conclusive evidence for benefit of therapeutic heparin in moderately ill ward patients with Covid-19 irrespective of D-dimer levels, but not in severely ill ICU patients.</p>
<p>The mortality reduction was more pronounced in RAPID than in the multiplatform trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Potential explanations include chance and a stronger contrast between treatment arms in RAPID as compared with the multiplatform trial:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> for pragmatic reasons, the multiplatform trial allowed intermediate dose heparin in the control group, and 28.2&#x0025; received higher than prophylactic doses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> RAPID only allowed prophylactic heparin doses, and only 2.1&#x0025; received higher doses (Table S15). The effectiveness of anticoagulation also seems to depend on the type of anticoagulant: the Anticoagulation Coronavirus (ACTION) trial used 15 to 20 mg of rivaroxaban in 94&#x0025; of patients assigned to therapeutic anticoagulation and found no benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Rivaroxaban is unlikely to have the anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties attributed to heparin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> In addition, ACTION allowed intermediate doses of enoxaparin in the control group.</p>
<p>Our trial has two major limitations. First, RAPID had an adaptive design. The protocol prespecified that the sample size would be increased if the conditional power at 75&#x0025; of the original sample size was between 60 and 80&#x0025;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> However, the conditional power was below 60&#x0025;, therefore the sample size was not increased, thus RAPID remained underpowered. Second, the trial had an open-label design, but all relevant outcomes were blindly adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee.</p>
<p>The RAPID trial did not find a significant reduction in the primary composite outcome of death, mechanical ventilation or ICU admission with therapeutic heparin. However, in conjunction with the multiplatform trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> it suggests a clinical benefit of therapeutic heparin in moderately ill ward patients with Covid-19.</p>
