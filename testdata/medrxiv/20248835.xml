<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>While social assistance through the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided expanded UI benefits during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic until July 2020, it is unclear whether social assistance was in subsequent months sufficient to meet everyday spending needs and to curb adverse sequelae of financial hardship. Among working-aged Americans with job-related income loss during the pandemic, this study explored the associations of financial hardship with mental health outcomes and food and housing insecurity after accounting for receipt of social assistance.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Using multivariable logistic regression and pooled repeated cross-sectional individual-level data on working-aged adults from nationally-representative surveys administered from September to November 2020, this study investigated the relationships between financial hardship and depressive and anxiety symptoms, food insufficiency, and, among housing renters, the likelihood of being evicted, controlling for the receipt of social assistance and other demographic and socioeconomic factors.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Experiencing somewhat of a financial hardship (vs no hardship) was linked to approximately 3-4 times higher odds of depressive or anxiety symptoms and a likely eviction, and a 15 times higher odds of food insufficiency. Experiencing considerable financial hardship (vs no hardship) predicted a 6-fold higher odds of depressive or anxiety symptoms, a 24-fold higher odds of a likely eviction, and a more than 50-fold higher odds of food insufficiency (all <italic>P</italic> values &#x003C;.001).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Even after accounting for receipt of social assistance, working-aged adults experiencing financial hardship had markedly greater odds of anxiety or depressive symptoms, food insufficiency, and an anticipated housing eviction. Across outcomes, these relationships were stronger at each successively higher level of financial hardship, and more than offset any corresponding benefits from social assistance. Overall, the findings from the present study point to the urgent need for direct and sustained cash relief well in excess of current levels of social assistance, as well as the imperative of extending housing renter eviction protections among Americans.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the filing of over 70 million unemployment insurance (UI) claims in the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and has been accompanied by heightened levels of food and housing insecurity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Through the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act enacted in March 2020, expanded UI benefits consisted of a &#x0024;600 weekly payment on top of state payments, 13 extra weeks of UI benefits, and broader UI eligibility guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> The federal bonus expired in late July 2020, and was followed by a six-week &#x0024;300 weekly benefit in the majority of states through a federal lost wages assistance program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Other provisions along with a public health housing eviction moratorium implemented in September 2020 are set to expire in late December 2020. On December 21, 2020, Congress approved a COVID-19 relief package that includes a one-time direct payment of &#x0024;600 to individuals and a federal UI bonus of &#x0024;300 weekly for 11 weeks, and that is now awaiting signature by President Trump.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>An analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau&#x2019;s Household Pulse Surveys (HPS) administered in June and July 2020 identified UI receipt as associated with better mental health and lower health-related social needs among working-aged adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> However, since the federal UI bonus subsequently lapsed and was followed by a subsidy considerably smaller in both amount and duration, it is unclear whether social assistance has been sufficient to meet everyday spending needs and to curb adverse sequelae of financial hardship among those experiencing employment-related income loss. This study was undertaken to estimate recent levels of and changes in financial hardship among working-aged Americans with job-related income loss during the pandemic, and to explore the associations of financial hardship with mental health outcomes and food and housing insecurity, after accounting for receipt of social assistance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>Three months of repeated cross-sectional individual-level data were pooled from nationally-representative HPS surveys administered from September 2&#x2014;November 23, 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> The study population was adults between the ages of 18 and 64 reporting a loss of household employment income since the beginning of the pandemic (March 13, 2020). The most recently available aggregate data were also drawn from the HPS public-use survey data tables (November 25&#x2014;December 7). The HPS used the Census Bureau&#x2019;s Master Address File as the source of sampled housing units (HUs). The sampling frame was a systematic sample of all eligible HUs, adjusted to select a sufficiently large sample to create state-level estimates and estimates for the top 15 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). The HPS was conducted online using Qualtrics as the data collection platform. Across data collection periods, survey response rates ranged from 5.6&#x0025; to 10.6&#x0025;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Predictors</title>
<p>Financial hardship was defined as household difficulty (not at all/a little/somewhat/very difficult) to pay for usual household expenses including food, rent or mortgage, and loans within the previous week. UI receipt was taken as household receipt of UI benefits since the pandemic began. Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) receipt was defined as household participation in SNAP and using SNAP benefits to meet spending needs within the previous week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Outcomes consisted of the frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms (using the 2- item Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2, respectively, for scores of 3-6 vs 0-2 to screen for depressive and anxiety disorders, with acceptable sensitivity and specificity levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>), the level of food insufficiency (often or sometimes not enough to eat vs enough to eat), and, among housing renters, the likelihood of being evicted within the next 2 months (very/extremely likely vs somewhat/not at all likely).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to estimate adjusted odds ratios with generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures within individuals and person-level survey weights and to obtain robust standard errors. Log-Poisson regression was not employed due to potential bias when estimating relative risks for binary outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> All models were adjusted for individual age, age squared, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, 2019 household income, other federal stimulus assistance, household size, children in household, general health status, state, and survey week. The model for current food insufficiency was also adjusted for pre- pandemic food insufficiency. Multiple imputation analysis (using 25 multiply imputed datasets) and complete case analysis were used to handle missing data for predictor and outcome variables, respectively. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Because all data lacked identifying information and were publicly available through the U.S. Census Bureau, this study was deemed exempt by the Human Subject Research Protection Committee at Northeastern University.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This nationally-representative study reveals high levels of financial hardship among working-aged Americans, that have gradually worsened from September to December 2020. Even after accounting for social assistance receipt, working-aged adults experiencing financial hardship had markedly greater odds of anxiety or depressive symptoms, food insufficiency, and an anticipated housing eviction. Across outcomes, these relationships were stronger at each successively higher level of financial hardship, and more than offset any corresponding benefits from UI or SNAP.</p>
<p>Strengths of this study include its use of nationally-representative survey data, as well as data from repeated survey waves that enabled the examination of trends in financial hardship over time. Models also controlled for multiple covariates such as baseline demographic and socioeconomic factors and state fixed effects to reduce confounding. In addition, missing data were handled using multiple imputation methods to reduce bias. Finally, the modeling of multiple categories for the financial hardship measure allowed for the exploration of the presence of dose-response relationships.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are limitations to this study. Because of the study&#x2019;s cross-sectional and observational design, bias due to reverse causation or confounding cannot be entirely ruled out. Moreover, we did not account for the received monetary amounts of UI and SNAP benefits. While sampling weights accounted for non-response, the low survey response rates could have led to selection bias. Last, all measures were based on self-report which could have affected validity, although the adjustment for general health status in all models should have attenuated the degree of same-source bias. There is evidence to support that during the period that the CARES Act was in effect in the spring of 2020, among adults whose families lost work or work-related income due to the pandemic, the level of social assistance including the &#x0024;600 weekly federal bonus for UI recipients was adequate to meet financial needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> UI receipt was linked to a 3- percentage point reduction in the share reporting food insecurity, a 3.7 percentage-point reduction in problems paying utility bills, and reductions of 8.6 to 15.1 percentage points in the share worrying about meeting basic needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Overall, the findings from the present study point to the urgent need for direct and sustained cash relief well in excess of current levels of social assistance, as well as the imperative of extending housing renter eviction protections. Based on the above prior evidence to support that economic hardship and food insecurity declined among UI recipients after enacting the CARES Act, and the current study&#x2019;s evidence that a substantial and growing share of working-aged adults has experienced household financial hardship since federal UI supplements lapsed by September 2020, in order to alleviate financial hardship and its adverse sequelae, a logical recommendation is that any future federal UI bonus match or even exceed the UI bonus level of &#x0024;600 weekly and one-time direct payment of &#x0024;1,200 previously provided through the CARES Act.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> If signed into law, the COVID-19 relief bill recently approved by Congress that limits the federal UI supplement to &#x0024;300 weekly and a one-time stimulus check of &#x0024;600, will in all likelihood not provide sufficient support for households that have experienced job- related income loss during the pandemic. Prioritization of expanded and needs-based social policy relief measures is critical to mitigate the pandemic&#x2019;s impacts on the physical, mental, and social well-being of tens of millions of Americans.</p>
