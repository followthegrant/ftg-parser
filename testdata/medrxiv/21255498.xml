<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) class-1 is known to play a significant role in mediating resistance or susceptibility to HIV infection in the clinical course of AIDS. Recent studies have identified HLA-C as a key molecule that affects HIV disease progression. However, the role of HLA class 1 in heterosexual HIV-1 susceptibility or resistance in serodiscordant couples is not known in Nigeria. Therefore, this study evaluated the association between HLA-C susceptibility and resistance in HIV-1 transmission amongst heterosexual serodiscordant couples in Nigeria.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>METHODS</title>
<p>A total of 271 serodiscordant, concordant HIV positive and negative couples who gave informed consent were enrolled into this study. Extracted genomic DNA was sequenced for high resolution HLA-C class 1 genotypes using allele-specific primers (on exons 2 and 3) for HLA-C sequencing and typing.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>The highest frequency distribution of high-resolution HLA-C alleles observed in the HIV positive subjects were: HLA-C&#x002A;040101 178 (35.0&#x0025;) followed by C&#x002A;0701 124 (24.9&#x0025;) compared with HIV negative subjects: C&#x002A;040101 108(39.0&#x0025;) followed by C&#x002A;0701 64(24.7&#x0025;). Alleles C&#x002A;070201 (OR = 4.19, <italic>P&#x003C;0</italic>.<italic>05</italic>) and C&#x002A;0804 (OR = 3, <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.045) were found to be independently associated with HIV-1 susceptibility in the cohort of serodiscordant couples. HLA-C&#x002A;0802 (OR=0.5. <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.005) and C&#x002A;0304 (OR=0.34. <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.002) were significantly associated with HIV-1 resistance to HIV-1 infection among the cohort.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>The result has contributed to the importance of how host HLA-C genetic factors can influence HIV-1 disease susceptibility (HLA-C&#x002A;070201; C&#x002A;0804) and resistance (HLA-C&#x002A;0802; C&#x002A;0304) in serodiscordant couples. This information may contribute to the development of future effective HIV vaccine in Nigeria.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection remains one of the greatest scourges of our time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kaiser, 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">UNAIDS, 2019</xref>), particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa &#x2013; with over 65&#x0025; of the world&#x2019;s HIV infection. Nigeria is considered to have the second largest HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa, and one of the highest rates of new HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">UNAID, 2019</xref>). Heterosexual exposure is the primary mode of transmission in Nigeria and involves mainly HIV-1. An estimated 70&#x0025; of HIV-1 infection occurs between married partners and co-habitation with HIV infected person represents the largest HIV risk group <italic>(</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bagala, 2006</xref>). Evidences indicate that significant number of HIV-1 infected couples in Nigeria are in serodiscordant relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nnebue <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Serodiscordant relationship is a term used to describe a couple in which one partner is infected by HIV and the other is not. Studies have implicated the HLA as important host immune response to HIV-1 infection and also suggest that the make-up of a person&#x2019;s HLA affects the individual&#x2019;s HIV disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tang <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The HLA are genetically inherited protein receptors that are present on the surface of human cells and involved mainly in self and non - self recognition of antigenic peptides. The HLA is the human version of the Major Histocompatibility Complex and is located at the short arm of human chromosome 6 (6p21), which spans approximately 4.0 kilobases of DNA, and contains more than 220 genes of diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Choo, 2007</xref>). The HLA is known to be the most polymorphic genetic system in humans and made up of class-I (HLA-A, -B and -C) and class-II (DP, DQ, DR, DM, DP and DP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tang <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lingappa <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The biological role of HLA class I and II molecules are to present processed antigenic peptides to CD8&#x002B; and CD4&#x002B; T lymphocytes respectively for immune recognition and stimulation, with the aim of destroying the pathogen from which the antigenic peptide came (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Choo, 2007</xref>). The MHC-1 molecules present viral peptides to CD8&#x002B; T-cells and serve as ligands for killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). A sub-set of MHC-1 allotypes are associated with delayed disease progression and effective control of viral replication, most notably HLA-B 5701 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kulpar <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous study by Fellay <italic>et al</italic>. (2011) identified HLA-C as a key molecule that affects HIV disease progression. In the event of HIV-1 infection, HLA-A, -B and -C proteins can all present viral peptides which are recognized by CD8&#x002B; T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bachtel <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). However, HLA-C allotypes dominate over HLA-A and HLA-B allotypes as a source of ligands for KIRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aguilar <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The HLA-C plays a crucial role as a molecule capable of sending inhibitory signals to both natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) via binding to the killer cell IgG-like receptors. The tendency of HLA-C to be expressed as open conformer, upon cell activation, endows it with unique capacity to associate with other cell surface molecules as well as with HIV-1 protein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Zipeto and Beretta, (2012)</xref>. Furthermore, promoter alleles express higher levels of HLA-C on T-lymphocyte that have significant control of HIV-1 viraemia and progress more slowly to AIDS. The Negative Regulatory Factor (NEF) protein also disrupts antigen presentation in association with HLA -A and HLA-B, but not HLA-C. This shows that HLA-C efficiently presents antigens to CTLs in HIV infection for immune recognition and stimulation.</p>
<p>A study on HIV-1 discordant couples in Zambia showed that viral transmission from index case to seronegative partners can vary according to specific HLA class I alleles or haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tang <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). The role HLA plays in HIV-1 transmission in serodiscordant couples in Nigeria is unknown. Data on HLA-C alleles associated with HIV-1 transmission in serodiscordant relationship is lacking in Nigeria. Therefore, this study aimed at providing some information in this respect.</p>
<p>Therefore, the objectives of this study are to:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Document the frequencies of HLA-C alleles in HIV positive and negative individuals</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Determine the role HLA-C class 1 variants play in HIV-1 resistance and or susceptibility to HIV-1 infection among serodiscordant couples.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Document the profile of Long-Term Non-Progressors&#x2019; HLA-C alleles, baseline and follow-up of CD4 count and Plasma viral load (HIV-RNA) among the index and partners.</p></list-item>
</list>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>The study population comprised HIV-1 serodiscordant couples attending the HIV clinics of Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH), Nnewi Nigeria, and Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Yaba, Lagos. HIV negative couples used as controls were recruited among NIMR Workers (NIMRW) and Divine Grace Church (DGC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Couples who have discordant HIV test results, co-habited for at least 3 months, have more than one partner, are 16-50 years of age (for female) or 16-65 years (for male), and HIV positive partner is or not on ARV.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Couples who are not within the required age group and have not co-habited for up to three months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Study Sites</title>
<p>Samples were collected and processed in two government-owned health institutions namely: Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Yaba, Lagos Nigeria, and Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH), Nnewi, Anambra State, Nigeria. Molecular experiments were carried out at National Microbiology Laboratory, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>Case&#x2013;control study of 271 couples: people living with HIV/AIDS and their HIV negative partners (serodiscordant couples), concordant HIV positive couples and concordant HIV negative couples (control) were recruited. The index may or may not be on Antiretroviral.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Focused group discussion</title>
<p>Participants were counselled and told to inform their partners about the research - to facilitate their consent. The partners of all index were screened for HIV. Those who subsequently turned out to be HIV positive were referred to NIMR and NAUTH HIV clinic for management. Couples recruited from NIMR workers (NIMRWC) and Divine Grace Church Couples (DGCC) were screened for HIV to confirm their sero-negative status.</p>
<p>Structured questionnaires were administered to the couples to obtain information on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of partners&#x2019; HIV status, knowledge of STIs, laboratory tests and treatment status, sexual behaviours and practices, were required for the completion of the questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Methods of Sample Collection and DNA Extraction</title>
<p>A total of 542 blood samples were collected from 236 couples from NIMR, and 35 couples from NAUTH. Whole blood was collected (by vein puncture) in EDTA-containing bottles for HIV antibody detection. The white cell pellet was separated from buffy coat by centrifugation of the blood samples at 2000 rpm for 15 minutes. DNA extraction was done using gnomic DNAQIAGEN kit as described by the manufacturers. Extracted DNA was placed in the cryovial and stored frozen at &#x2212;80<sup>0</sup>C for further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Laboratory Investigations</title>
<sec id="s2h1">
<title>DNA Amplification</title>
<p>Amplification of the DNA was made by using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Each PCR reaction was composed of 20&#x00B5;l of ddH2O, 5&#x00B5;l of gDNA, and 25&#x00B5;l of master mix. The master mix contained 22.75&#x00B5;l of 2X mix (120mM Tris-HCl, 3mM MgCl2, 30mM (NH4)2SO4, 200&#x00B5;M dNTPs, 0.2&#x0025; gelatin, ddH2O), 55 pmol of both forward and reverse primers (Primer structural sequence is as shown below) and 13.75 &#x00B5;l of Taq polymerase. For HLA -C typing, primers were set to detect polymorphisms in exons 2 and 3 of the class 1 genes as these regions cover most of the know polymorphisms. The structural sequence of the primers used for HLA-C was CPCRR (representing HLA-C Reverse primers), and CPCRF (representing HLA-C Forward primers), as shown below.</p>
<table-wrap id="utbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="21255498v1_utbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>The PCR program was as follows: a 5 minute initial denaturation at 96<sup>&#x00B0;</sup>C, followed by 44 cycles of one minute of denaturation at 96<sup>&#x00B0;</sup>C, one minute of primer annealing at 5<sup>&#x00B0;</sup>C below the Tm of the respective primers and two minutes at 72<sup>0</sup>C for elongation. Each PCR programme finished with a final elongation step at 72<sup>&#x00B0;</sup>C for ten minutes. After amplification, Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (1&#x0025; Agarose gel) was used to identify the amplified DNA products</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s2i">
<title>Purification of PCR Product</title>
<p>Following the PCR, the product was precipitated using 21&#x00B5;l of a mixture containing 5ml of 95&#x0025; ethanol and 250&#x00B5;l of sodium acetate. Finally, the content of each well was transferred to MicroAMP&#x2122; plates and put in the Applied Biosystems&#x2122; 3130xl Genetic Analyzer for electrophoresis, according to Agencourt&#x00AE; AMPure Protocol (2007).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2j">
<title>Sequencing HLA PCR, using Sanger Sequencing Method (Sanger <italic>et al</italic>., 1997)</title>
<p>This was performed after the PCR products were purified. Sequencing was focused on the most polymorphic exons of the class 1 genes. To genotype HLA-C alleles, exons 2 and 3 were sequenced (21). Each sequencing PCR reaction contained 4&#x00B5;l of purified PCR product, 1.5&#x00B5;l primer at 3.2&#x00B5;M and 2&#x00B5;l of Applied Biosystems&#x2122;.

<p>For sequencing-PCR, each primer (forward or reverse) was in separate reactions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2k">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The BigDye v1.1 and primers were defrosted in a tray of ice.</p>
<p>Using a Pipette, <bold>44.5</bold> &#x00B5;l of the BigDye and Primer was added to the <bold>first column</bold> of the plate, <bold>3.5</bold> &#x00B5;l of master mix was pipetted to the remaining columns, and <bold>4</bold>&#x03BC;<bold>l DNA</bold> was added to each column. Plates were sealed with silicone foil, quick spun and placed in thermocycler for 8 hrs. Each PCR master plate of 96-wells was done twice. One 96 -well plate contained reverse primers and another 96 -well plate contained forward primers. During the elongation steps, deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) and smaller amounts of fluorescently labelled dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs) were added into the growing strand. The sequencing PCR program commenced with an initial denaturation at 96&#x00B0;C for three minutes, followed by 80 cycles of denaturation at 96&#x00B0;C for thirty seconds, primer annealing at 50&#x00B0;C below its Tm for thirty seconds, and finally an elongation step at 60&#x00B0;C for four minutes. A total of 8 hrs was spent to assay each HLA PCR Sequencing reaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2l">
<title>Ethanol Precipitation</title>
<p>Following Sequencing PCR, the PCR plate was quick spun and 21&#x00B5;l of a mixture containing 5ml of 95&#x0025; ethanol and 250&#x00B5;l of sodium acetate was dispensed into the plates. This process removed any buffers, salts and reagents in the PCR product. The plate was sealed with a metal foil, vortexed and spun quickly. The plate was then placed in a &#x2212;20&#x00B0;C for 1 hour. Plate was spun at 4000rpm for I hour (Long spin step). Finally, the contents of each well were transferred to MicroAMP&#x2122; plates and put in the Applied Biosystems&#x2122; 3130xl Genetic Analyzer for electrophoresis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2m">
<title>Biosystems&#x2122; 3130xl Genetic Electropherogram</title>
<p>Each participant&#x2019;s sequenced PCR product was loaded in the Biosystems for electrophoresis and data analysed, using appropriate software, and interpreted according to Applied Biosystem manual.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2n">
<title>Condon Express TM and Sequencher V5 for Data Integrity</title>
<p>CodonExpress was used to type the Sequence-Based HLA class 1 genes as described by the University of Manitoba, Canada instruction manual (2010). Data Integrity was done by using DNA Sequencer V5 Software to rule out all unresolved HLA typing ambiguities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2o">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data generated were entered into IBM SPSS statistics version 20. Cross-sectional analysis using Chi Square was used to identify association between genetic and non-genetic factors. Confidence interval was set at 95&#x0025; with level of significance set at <italic>P</italic>&#x003C; 0.05. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was conducted with on-line software from HIV databases.</p>

<title>Long Term Non-progressors and their Partners</title>
<p>The longest period any of them have lived without drugs is &#x003E; 7 years (12 HIV positive individuals) and the shortest is 0-12 months (57 HIV positive individuals). The profile of Long-term Non -Progressor&#x2019;s (LTNP) among HIV positive individuals were reviewed along differential HLA types, their partners, baseline, follow-up of CD4&#x002B; count and plasma viral loads.</p>
<p>It was observed that this group of indexes have HLA-C genes associated with low plasma viral loads (HIV-1 RNA) and high CD4 T cell counts. However, their partners (80&#x0025;) were HIV Negative. HIV susceptible alleles (C&#x002A;07:02) was identified in 5 individuals and a couple inherited the allele C&#x002A;07:20:01 in allele group level.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Previous studies reported that couples who do not have knowledge of their HIV status gave room to increased heterosexual HIV transmission among them in sub-Saharan Africa (Idoko <italic>et al</italic>., 2015, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Allen <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref> and Begala, 2006). Again, it has been reported that HIV-1 serodiscordant couples produced clear evidence that HIV-1 transmission from HIV positive (index) to seronegative partners depended on the specific HLA class 1 alleles which is also dependent on the strong plasma viral load (PVL) (HIV-1 RNA) and immunological control CD4 T cell count of the index (Peterson <italic>et al</italic>., 2015 and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Tang <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of HLA-C polymorphisms associated with HIV-1 transmission amongst heterosexual serodiscordant couples was investigated.</p>
<p>Our result in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref> showed that some HLA-C alleles have some protective and susceptible effects across the HLA-C class I locus which is also dependent on individuals&#x2019; plasma viral load and immunological control, CD4 T cell count. HLA-C&#x002A;07:02:01 (OR = 4.19, <italic>P&#x003C;0</italic>.<italic>05</italic>) and C&#x002A;08:04 (OR = 3, <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.045) were found to be independently associated with HIV-1 susceptibility or HIV diseases progression in the cohort of serodiscordant couples in Nigeria. HLA-C &#x002A;07:01 alleles were significantly associated with high plasma viral loads (<italic>P&#x003C;0</italic>.<italic>004)</italic> when compared with &#x002A;08:04 that was moderately associated with high plasma viral loads (<italic>P&#x003C;0</italic>.<italic>06)</italic>. HIV negative partners of the index case with these alleles (C&#x002A;07:02:01 (OR = 4.19, <italic>P&#x003C;0</italic>.<italic>05</italic>) and C&#x002A;08:04 (OR = 3, <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.045) are likely to seroconvert. With these alleles (C&#x002A;07:02:01/C&#x002A;08:04), HIV transmission to the HIV negative partner may be possible, if the index case is a male and have other clinical markers of HIV disease progression such as presence of untreated Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), other behavioural factors such as: age, non to inconsistent condom use, type of sexual activity involved in, multiple sexual partners and inconsistence in the use of ARVs. This result is consistent with a study done in Kenyan Pumwani Sex Workers&#x2019; cohort where alleles C&#x002A;07:02:01/ B&#x002A;07:02:01 were recorded as being associated with rapid HIV seroconversion as reported by Peterson <italic>et al</italic>. (2015). However, HLA-C&#x002A;08:04 18(3.5&#x0025;) is being reported for the first time to be associated with HIV seroconversion or HIV susceptibility in Nigeria. HLA-C&#x002A;08:04 was identified in the HLA-C locus of African American population as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tu <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref> and so was consistent with West African population HLA specific diversity. This observation calls for further studies on the mechanism by which C&#x002A;08:04 allele may influence HIV seroconversion in the cohort of serodiscordant couples. Previous studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bachtel et al., (2018)</xref> showed that HLA alleles that are not protective have affinity for Nef protein. Nef protein reportedly destroys HLA, CD4 &#x002B;, and CD28&#x002B; cell surface expression and protect HIV infected cell from CTL recognition and destruction. By the destruction of HLA cell surface expression, there is down regulation of subset of HLA -C, -A, -B and E molecule which prevents HIV recognition by NK cells for destruction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Blais <italic>et al</italic>., (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>We also observed that some individuals that have HLA-C&#x002A;08:02 (OR=0.05, <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.005) and C&#x002A;03:04 (OR= 0.34, <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.002) alleles were significantly associated with HIV-1 resistance. Majority of the individuals having HLA-C&#x002A;03:04 were significantly associated with high CD4 T cell <italic>(P= 0</italic>.<italic>002</italic>) and baseline plasma viral loads ranging from 20-645copies/ml and so, are less likely to seroconvert. The result from this study is comparable to some reports from previous studies where the partner of the index may remain seronegative if the HIV-1 RNA of the index is consistently at 20copies/mm3 (lower limit of detection of either 40 or 50 copies/ml) as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aidsmap, (2016)</xref>. It is also comparable with reports from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Quinn <italic>et al</italic>., (2000)</xref> who established from their studies that, if the HIV-RNA remains at 20copies/mm3, the index may not be able to transmit HIV to his/her negative partner. Furthermore, having an undetectable plasma viral load (HIV-1 RNA) confirms that the risk of HIV becoming resistant to ARV is very minimal. This further shows that, with improved immune system, the risk of having opportunistic infections is reduced. Though HLA-C&#x002A;08:02 and C&#x002A;03:04 were newly observed to show resistance to HIV &#x2212;1 acquisition in Nigeria, it is possible that their cytotoxic lymphocyte expression improved HIV control through active cytotoxic CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell responses. (CD8<bold>&#x002B;</bold> cytotoxic T lymphocytes CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T directly killing virally infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines).</p>
<p>Some HLA-C alleles identified in Kenyan studies (Peterson <italic>et al</italic>., 2015) as protective alleles include: C&#x002A;06:02 and C&#x002A;07:01 which is contrary to our findings. Our study observed that they were associated with very high plasma viral loads and low CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cells <italic>(p =</italic>0.006 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.003). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Borghans <italic>et al</italic>. (2007)</xref> in their study showed that HLA alleles that is, defending the immune system have a true preference for the p24 Gag protein and CTL responses against Gag which moderately reduces HIV disease evolution.</p>
<p>The Long-term Non-Progressor&#x2019;s (LTNP) HLA-C locus contains differential allele types which fall among &#x002A;04:01:01 (50&#x0025;), 17:01 (40&#x0025;) and 07:01(30&#x0025;) in Nigeria. The reason for this preferential HLA types is not well understood so can be further investigated. Another study that is consistent with our study, identified C&#x002A;07 and C&#x002A;04 restricted Cytotoxic Lymphocytes in Long Time Non-progressors. However, Zepeto and Beretta, (2012) identified C&#x002A;07, C&#x002A;04 and C&#x002A;17 as inhibited alleles or at-risk alleles that are not protective. This is because they contain an intact miR-168 biding site and their expression on the surface are down -regulated. Our study further observed that this group of indexes (LTNPs) has HLA-C genes associated with low plasma viral loads (HIV-1 RNA) and high CD4 T cell counts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Davis (2014)</xref> recent study, reported in his study that 11 of the 13 LTNP (85&#x0025;) had a gene encoding an HLA variant called HLA-B&#x002A;5701 which has been implicated to slow HIV disease evolution. However, in this study, HLA-C gene was found restricting HIV-1 multiplication in 6.2&#x0025; of 271 serodiscordant couples and delay AIDS on-set in these indexes. In another previous study, LTNPs was associated with a weak or non-active form of HIV, but it is now known that many LTNP patients carry a virulent form of the virus HLA-C O&#x2019;connell <italic>et al</italic>., (2009) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Blankson <italic>et al</italic>., (2009)</xref>. HLA-C LTNPs may be associated with increased surface expression which is associated with reduced viral load and low CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell counts, or the alleles have preference for p24 Gag protein which reduces HIV diseases progression. This High HLA-C expression have improved HIV control through active cytotoxic CD8<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T cell responses as recorded in African and European Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Apps <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>High resolution frequencies observed in HIV-1 positive individuals were: C&#x002A;04:01:01 (178, 24.7&#x0025;) and C&#x002A;07:01 (124, 24.9&#x0025;) compared to HIV negative individuals: C&#x002A;04:01:01 (108, 39.0&#x0025;) followed by C&#x002A;07:01 (64, 24.7&#x0025;). These results showed consistency with a study done in Kenyan where C&#x002A;07:01 (16.1&#x0025;) and C&#x002A;04:01:01 (12.5&#x0025;) had the highest frequencies in their study population, (Peterson <italic>et al</italic>. 2015). Interestingly, one of the rarest alleles, C&#x002A;01:02:01, identified in this study: (1, 0.2&#x0025; HIV &#x002B;) and (1, 0.4&#x0025; HIV-), was also rarely observed among Kenyan population. In Harare Zimbabwe also, C&#x002A;04:01:01 (25.2&#x0025;) was the most frequent allele observed in the population of 123 children and adolescent aged 10-18 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ferrand <italic>et al</italic>., (2015)</xref> which is also consistent with this study. Peterson <italic>et al</italic>., (2014) reported the diversity and frequencies of HLA-alleles and haplotypes among the East African Population C&#x002A;06:02:01(31.37&#x0025;), C&#x002A;04:01:01(31&#x0025;) and C&#x002A;07:01:01(26.35&#x0025;) which is also consistent with our findings. This is showing that there are similarities in HLA -C haplotypes and alleles of all African descent.</p>

<title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>This study has shown how some HLA alleles (C&#x002A;07:02:01 /C&#x002A;0804) and (C&#x002A;08:08/C&#x002A;03:04) contributed to HIV-1 disease susceptibility and resistance in serodiscordant couples in Nigeria. The mechanism involved CD4<sup>&#x002B;</sup> T helper cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes immune responses that control the spread of chronic and acute HIV-1 diseases. This information may contribute to the development of future effective HIV vaccine in Nigeria. It was also discovered that C&#x002A;04:01:01 and C&#x002A;07:01 has the highest frequency distribution in both HIV positive and HIV negative individuals. This is showing that there are similarities in HLA -C haplotypes and alleles of all African descent.</p>
