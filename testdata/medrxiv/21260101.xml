<title>Text</title>
<p>A standardized panel composed of well-characterized plasma/serum specimens can bridge serosurveillance studies, compare test kits, serve as external quality assurance, harmonize tests that measure vaccine efficacy, be used as a training tool and be used for post-market assurance. The standardized panel can be shared by a global network to link studies and enable inclusive analysis for a variety of use cases as mentioned and, more importantly, a standardized control panel can provide long-term quality performance monitoring as reagents and production batches change.</p>
<p>We have established a COVID-19 Serology Control Panel (CSCP) using the dried tube specimen (DTS) protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> so that the panel can be shipped globally without a cold-chain, thus allowing equitable sharing of the materials in all resource settings. Identifying the appropriate test kit for a use-case is complicated, with >120 SARS-CoV-2 serological test kits listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under Emergency Use Authorized (EUA) and/or registered with the Conformit&#x00E8; Europ&#x00EB;enne (CE)-marked European market. In addition, we can deduce from the SeroTracker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> list that there are at least as many research use only (RUO) tests being used in clinics and research laboratories as well. With this unprecedented number of serological testing platforms and algorithms, it is imperative that we prioritize the quality calibration of test kits and platforms. This will ensure that results are meaningful and can be compared across the hundreds of seroprevalence studies being undertaken.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> This is especially important for testing in low resource settings, where immunological testing is more likely to be used than other diagnostic test formats.</p>

<title>The Study</title>
<p>Nine highly-reactive COVID-19 convalescent plasma samples collected between March-May 2020 were screened by SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) reporter viral particle neutralization assay (RVPN), with neutralization range of 1:640 to >1:10,240 (Vitalant Research Institute, VRI; San Francisco, CA) and by Ortho VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total immunoglobulin assay (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. Rochester, NY) against the S subunit (S1) protein (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> These nine COVID-19 convalescent plasma and one pre-2019 human plasma were sourced from VRI, Denver, CO and certified to be blood-borne pathogen-free. This protocol has a University of Colorado-Denver (CU) Human Subjects Research Waiver (Protocol 20-0711).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>We tested the 10 donor samples at University of Colorado laboratories (CU Labs) to determine each sample&#x2019;s reactivity to Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N) and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with five SARS-CoV-2 serology methods (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. We pooled three samples that represented the highest reactivity to S, N and RBD in a 1:1:1 ratio. The undiluted pool served as the high reactive (HR) sample and the pre-2019 served as the non-reactive (NR) in all the assays. The low reactive (LR) pool was prepared as a 1:4 dilution of the HR using the NR sample as the diluent. Then the three samples&#x2014;HR, LR and NR&#x2014;were evaluated by CU Labs to ascertain their reactivity by dilution and mixing, and evaluated again post-drying (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a-1e</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="21260101v2_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We followed the DTS protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> to prepare the samples, mixing in 0.1 &#x0025; green food dye for better visualization. We aliquoted 20 &#x03BC;l in a 2 ml Sarstedt (NC9180825; Fisher Scientific, USA) and left the open tube to dry overnight under a HEPA filtered laminar flow hood. The tubes were capped and stored at 4&#x00B0; C during the CSCP kit assembly process and stored at -20&#x00B0; C afterwards to preserve the integrity of the samples for longer term storage. Each of the DTS was rehydrated by addition of 200 &#x03BC;l phosphate buffered saline with 0.2&#x0025; Tween (PBS diluent) then tested in tandem with its corresponding pre-dried (liquid) sample to ensure that there was no change in reactivity due to the drying, assembly, and rehydration steps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>).</p>
<p>We evaluated the CSCP long term temperature stability by storing kits continuously at: -20&#x00B0;C, 4&#x00B0;C, 25&#x00B0;C, 37&#x00B0;C and 45&#x00B0;C for 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. The optimal stability of the CSCP for up to 6 months is between -20&#x00B0;C and 25&#x00B0;C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) with loss of reactivity after 2 months at 37&#x00B0;C and is non-reactive at 45&#x00B0;C (data not shown). In the 6-months&#x2019; evaluation, we compared the CSCP DTS samples with the World Health Organization SARS CoV-2 Serology International Standard (WHO IS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and found the HR sample runs are in the same reactive range (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>A CSCP kit contains five DTS samples (blinded), 200 &#x03BC;l of PBS diluent, a 0.5 ml calibrated disposable micropipette, a dry silica pack, a printed DTS rehydration work aide and a copy of the report form. Contents are sealed in a 1.5&#x00D7;9 inch mailing tube. Interested users fill out a <underline>CSCP request form</underline> and each request is reviewed, assessed and approved before being the requested CSCP kit is shipped at ambient temperature with no cold packs. Users then use the kit according to their serology assay requirements and report the results electronically (<underline>CSCP Result Form</underline>) or email a copy to <email>COVIDPanel@ucdenver.edu</email>. We then send the user a results form that provides a comparison and interpretation of their results against the assigned value for the DTS samples that they received.</p>
<p>As of June 2021, the CSCP has been shipped to multiple sites in Australia, Africa, Southeast Asia, North and South America, and Europe. <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows a summary of the 30 user results reported to us thus far, with CSCP concordance of the HR, NR, and LR being 97&#x0025;, 93&#x0025;, and 65&#x0025; respectively. The LR samples were expected to be missed in the less sensitive assays (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Users have shared with us some logistical challenges encountered, including kits that were in transit for up to 3 months under harsh conditions (1 user) and some kits held for months before use (2 users), without change in the expected results. One user has reported issues with incomplete reconstitution and 2 users had problems uploading results to the website, all of which are under review for corrective actions.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Quality assurance is foundational for validating methods, external quality assurance, training, and inter-/intra-laboratory comparison of serologic tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> As more of the world&#x2019;s population receive COVID-19 vaccines, highly accurate and reliable SARS-COV-2 serology testing is the primary method to assess vaccine efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Many commercial and laboratory developed tests react with a range of antigen targets, making it difficult to compare results in the absence of a common set of reference materials. Widespread use of the CSCP for comparison of SARS-CoV-2 tests will help laboratories interpret and gain confidence in their results while deterring laboratories from using poorly performing tests. Additionally, the CSCP will help clinical laboratories inform their choice of diagnostic test to supplement clinical diagnoses of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p>With this use in mind, our next step is to harmonize CSCP and other available serology reference materials by validating them as secondary standards to the WHO IS. This would provide an inferential link to WHO IS and give broader access of validated reference materials to be used in comparing and evaluating test kits performances in use-cases already cited. The DTS system is also flexible enough to accommodate additional samples to reflect current pandemic situations, such as post-vaccination and convalescent samples from persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>
