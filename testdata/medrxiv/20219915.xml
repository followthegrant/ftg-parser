<title>Abstract</title>
<p>microRNAs are promising drug targets in obesity and metabolic disorders. miR-21 expression is upregulated in obese white adipose tissue (WAT); however, its physiological role in WAT has not been fully explored. We aimed to dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms of miR-21 in treating obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance. We demonstrated, in human and mice, that elevated miR-21 expression is associated with metabolically healthy obesity. miR-21 mimic affected the expression of genes associated with adipogenesis, thermogenesis, and browning in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, it blocked high fat diet-induced weight gain in obese mice, without modifying food intake or physical activity. This was associated with metabolic enhancements, WAT browning and thermogenic programming, and brown AT induction through VEGF-A, p53, and TGF&#x03B2;1 signaling pathways. Our findings add a novel role of miR-21 in the regulation of obesity and a potential therapy for both obesity and T2D without altering caloric intake and physical activities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity is slowly becoming a global health epidemic. It is commonly associated with different diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, compromising the quality of life and putting an enormous economic burden on society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hruby &#x0026; Hu, 2015</xref>). However, there are no efficient therapies to date for the treatment of obesity. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have arisen as potential therapeutic targets due to their regulatory role in many biological processes, including transcriptional regulation of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhong <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>It is well established that white adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction leads to the development of obesity-related metabolic disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Rodr&#x00ED;guez <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chouchani &#x0026; Kajimura, 2019</xref>). Given the existence of metabolically healthy obese subjects and diabetic lean individuals, it has been suggested that when the expansion capacity of adipose tissue (AT) required to store excess energy is exceeded, metabolic disorders occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hajer <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). In this case, dysfunctional WAT results in the accumulation of fat in non-fatty organs, such as muscles, the pancreas, liver, and the heart, leading to lipotoxicity and impaired insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Friesen &#x0026; Cowan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chouchani &#x0026; Kajimura, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to WAT, brown (BAT) and beige AT, rich in mitochondria, are involved in weight management and metabolic homeostasis due to their high energy-utilizing capacity through thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harms &#x0026; Seale, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Villarroya &#x0026; Vidal-Puig, 2013</xref>). Beige thermogenic adipocytes arise in WAT depots after continuous exposure to cold, &#x03B2;3-adrenergic stimulation or by genetic manipulation of certain specific pathways. This process is known as browning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Reitman, 2017</xref>), which can be induced pharmacologically by activation of the &#x03B2;3-adrenergic receptor and thiazolidinediones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Reitman, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, rodent models have shown that WAT browning was able to promote metabolic improvement and resistance to diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Seale <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Within this context, interest has increased in the role of miRNAs in the development of fat cells and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhong <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). In particular, many miRNAs have been defined as regulators of the differentiation and function of beige AT and BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Karbiener &#x0026; Scheideler, 2014</xref>). Understanding the role of miRNAs in the thermogenic activation of BAT and the browning of WAT can provide new therapeutic targets against obesity and associated metabolic diseases. To take advantage of the full potential of miRNA-based therapies, selecting most suitable miRNA is required, which makes the performing of comprehensive studies on candidate miRNA function necessary.</p>
<p>miR-21 was found to be frequently upregulated in many chronic diseases, such as obesity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sekar <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Keller <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). miR-21 is upregulated in epididymal WAT from obese mice compared to normoweights (NW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Keller <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), and in type 2 diabetic obese compared to non-diabetic obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Guglielmi <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). miR-21 enhances adipogenic differentiation through the modulation of transforming growth factor (TGF-&#x03B2;) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jeong Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), and plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis through the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), which is in turn known to be a regulator of thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Richart <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). However, the precise mechanisms underlying its relationship with obesity and type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance have not yet been described. Therefore, based on previous bioinformatics analysis, we aimed to analyze the effect of miR-21 on the principal processes involved in the regulation of WAT function and expansion. In this regard, through <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments in which miR-21 effects are mimicked, we aimed to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects and the real connection between the increase of this miR-21, adipose tissue functionality, obesity, type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.</p>

<title>In-silico analysis of miR-21 potential targets</title>
<p>miR-21 has been suggested to be potentially related to obesity and to be involved in adipogenesis regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Keller <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is important to investigate the real role of this miRNA in AT functionality regulation. It is well known that several factors such as angiogenesis, adipogenesis and apoptosis are related to adipose tissue functionality and then to obesity and associated metabolic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tinahones <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>, 2012). We investigated the role of miR-21 in obesity using different bioinformatics tools as mentioned in the Methods section and 1505 validated target genes for miR-21, mainly involved in angiogenesis, VEGF signaling, apoptosis, adipogenesis and brown adipocyte differentiation, were identified (<bold>Table S1 and Table S2</bold>).</p>

<p>To biologically validate the <italic>in-silico</italic> predicted miR-21 target genes, we investigated the effects of miR-21 mimic administration in 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes. <italic>In vitro</italic> treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with miR-21 mimic was validated by the significant increase of miR-21 levels in treated cells compared to controls (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). miR-21 mimic led to a significant increase in angiogenic genes, mainly <italic>Vegf-A, Vegf-B</italic> and <italic>Vegf-C</italic>, and decreased <italic>Ang2, Ang4</italic> and the anti-angiogenic <italic>Timp-3</italic> genes compared to control cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). Moreover, miR-21 mimic led to the significant increase of both the anti-apoptotic <italic>Bcl-2</italic> and the pro-apoptotic <italic>Casp-3</italic> and <italic>Bid</italic>, compared to controls (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1C</xref></bold>).

<p>C57BL/6J mice (11-weeks old at arrival) were fed with chow-diet for one week (quarantine period) and then switched to a high-fat diet (45% kcal from saturated fat) from day 0 (start of the experiment) for 17 weeks. Twice a week, body weight was monitored in awake mice. During these 17 weeks of 45%HFD diet, after the first 8 weeks, mice were injected subcutaneously with miR-21 mimic (0.5 &#x03BC;g, n=8) or control miRNA mimic (0.5 &#x03BC;g, n=9) three times a week for further 8 weeks. Additionally, a subgroup of 45% HFD-mice was injected with jetPEI (0.086 &#x03BC;l, n=4) with the same timing as miR-21 mimic or control mimic (not shown in the graph). At week 16, the glucose tolerance test (GTT) was measured, and two days later, the insulin tolerance test (ITT) was measured. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at the end of the experiment at week 17. Then, blood samples, interscapular brown (BAT), white interscapular (intWAT) and inguinal (ingWAT) adipose tissues were collected and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C until analysis. Mice fed a 45% HFD naive (n=8) and treated with jetPEI (n=4) were also included and weighed (data not shown). The control diet was taken as a reference for body weight gain and glucose tolerance in non-obese mice during the time course of the whole study.</p></caption>

<title>In vivo sustained treatment with miR-21 mimic decelerated weight gain without affecting glucose and insulin tolerance in HFD obese mice</title>
<p>Given the involvement of miR-21 in the regulation of several genes related to AT function, we explored the effect of miR-21 mimic in obesity. For this purpose, we treated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice with the miR-21 mimic. To be more precise, the C57Bl/6J strain of mice (susceptible to developing obesity and metabolic disturbances after HFD feeding for several weeks, mimicking human obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Romero-Zerbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>)) were used as detailed below. We treated C57BL/6J obese mice (45% HFD) with 0.5 &#x03BC;g of miR-21 mimic or its corresponding miRNA control mimic for an additional period of 8 weeks under HFD. HFD-induced weight and glucose changes previous to miR-21 administration are depicted in <bold>Supplemental Figure S1</bold>. The miR-21 mimic led to a significant deceleration of 45% HFD-induced weight gain compared to the miRNA control mimic (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). As illustrated in the AUC weight gain graph, considering the initial weight (prior to miR-21 mimic treatment) as the basal point (0), the mice from each treatment group did not gain weight in the same way: the group treated with miR-21 mimic did not significantly gain weight upon miR-21 administration, while mice treated with the mimic control did. However, no significant amelioration was observed regarding insulin and glucose tolerance with the treatment with the <italic>in vivo</italic> miR-21 mimic (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). No changes were observed with vehicle (JetPei) treatment compared to the control (data not shown).</p>

Glucose (GTT) and insulin (ITT) tolerance tests were carried out during the last week of treatment (week 16) by injecting 2 g/kg of D-glucose or 0.5 U/kg of insulin, respectively, after 10-12 hours of fasting. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein at 0 (basal), 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes, and glucose measured with a glucometer. <bold>(B) Open field test</bold> (OFT) was performed to measure the locomotor activity of obese mice treated with miR-21 mimic or control mimic.

Five weeks after miR-21 or control mimic treatment, a food intake test was carried out by measuring the mouse body weight and food pellets for 5 days.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We here describe evidence showing that miR-21 is involved in the regulation of AT functionality, by controlling a number of genes and biological processes including thermogenesis and browning, angiogenesis, VEGF signaling, apoptosis and adipogenesis, suggesting the pivotal role that miR-21 could be playing in obesity and its related metabolic alterations such as T2D and IR, by modulating AT physiology.</p>
<p>While investigating the mechanisms underlying the effects of the previously reported increase in WAT miR-21 levels in obesity and T2D(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Guglielmi <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Keller <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), we unexpectedly realized that the mimetization of miR-21 may be a potential effective therapy for obesity. Specifically, the administration of miR-21 mimic in obese mice stopped the HFD-induced weight gain independently of food intake or physical activity. Interestingly, these were accompanied by the activation of browning and the thermogenic programming in WAT corroborated by changes in metabolic activity, protein expression, and cellular ultrastructure. This was further supported by the upregulation of browning and thermogenesis markers in WAT and BAT. Concordant with the apparent protective role against obesity, miR-21 high expression levels were associated with metabolically healthy obesity in humans and mice. These data establish miR-21 mimic as a potential therapy for obesity by inhibiting weight gain in a healthy manner.</p>
<p>It is well described that deregulation of WAT apoptosis, adipogenesis and angiogenesis are described to underlie AT dysfunction in obesity, which in turn increases the risk of T2D and IR(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bl&#x00FC;her, 2009</xref>). Here, miR-21 mimic treatment seems to regulate WAT angiogenesis through increasing the expression levels of the pro-angiogenic factors <italic>Vegf-A</italic> and <italic>Vegf-B. Vegf-A</italic> is a key regulator of angiogenesis, a validated target gene of miR-21 and its overexpression in AT has been reported to protect against diet-induced obesity and IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Elias <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). <italic>Vegf-B</italic> has also been associated with an enhanced insulin delivery and function in AT, resulting in an improvement of metabolic health in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Karaman <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). In agreement with the pro-angiogenic role of miR-21, it has been previously reported that miR-21 triggers angiogenic mediators, such as <italic>Timp3, Ang2</italic> and <italic>Ang4</italic>, in several cell types. These factors have been involved in regulating angiogenesis in WAT and are associated with positive metabolic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">An <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We also saw that miR-21 mimic upregulates <italic>Bcl2, Bid</italic> and <italic>Casp3</italic> genes in adipocytes, which have been well described to play a pivotal role in controlling the impairment of insulin signaling in human AT through the regulation of the inflammatory processes and the development of the obesity-associated insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alkhouri <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tinahones <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Surprisingly, in adipocytes, miR-21 mimic appears to significantly reduce the expression levels of both <italic>Cebp-&#x03B1;</italic> and <italic>Ppar-&#x03B3;</italic>, which are the master transcriptional regulators of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">White &#x0026; Stephens, 2010</xref>), while increasing the expression of <italic>Pgc-1&#x03B1;</italic> and <italic>Fgf21</italic>, genes well known to play a relevant role in BAT thermogenesis and WAT browning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coskun <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fisher <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that miR-21 mimic treatment, as well as regulating the key mediators of WAT functionality and expansion, also seems to promote the switch to the thermogenic adipocyte cell lineage while reducing the process related to white adipocytes cell lineage.</p>
<p>Interestingly, sustained exogenous administration of miR-21 mimic in obese mice abolished HFD-induced weight gain. It is well known that obesity and body weight are associated with the energy balance between food intake and energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Slawik &#x0026; Vidal-Puig, 2007</xref>). Within this context, the fact that the <italic>in vivo</italic> miR-21 mimic treatment did not affect locomotor activity or calorie intake compared to controls, suggests a direct involvement of miR-21 in mechanisms regulating fat accumulation related to the activation of thermogenesis and browning, two processes that have arisen as potential targets for the management of obesity and its related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Peirce <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Several studies have shown that the activity of brown and beige adipocytes is associated with resistance to obesity in several mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cederberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kopecky <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Seale <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). In addition, it is well recognized that increased activity of brown and beige fat not only affects the weight gain of mice but also improves systemic metabolism, including the improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cederberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Seale <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bordicchia <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bostr&#x00F6;m <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Many miRNAs have been reported to be related to the regulation of genes mediators of beige and brown adipocytes differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mori <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sun <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Trajkovski <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, the involvement of miR-21 in the regulation of thermogenesis and browning gene expression has not yet been previously described. Here, we show that miR-21 mimic could play a pivotal role in obesity and weight gain control through browning and thermogenesis activation involving the induction of <italic>Tmem26, Pgc-1&#x03B1;, Ucp1, Prdm 16, Fgf21, Cidea, Ppar&#x03B3; and Vegf-A</italic> gene overexpression and mitochondrial biogenesis process.</p>

These genes are primarily involved in the regulation of browning thermogenesis, adipogenesis, and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Elias <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hallenborg <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yadav <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), as well as predicted (non-validated) miR-21 target genes, including <italic>Ppar-&#x03B3;, Prdm16</italic> and <italic>Tmem26</italic>, which are primarily known to be key regulators of browning and thermogenesis in AT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Seale <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Petrovic <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref></bold>). We also provided experimental evidence through our <italic>in vivo, ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of novel gene targets of miR-21 in WAT, namely, <italic>Ucp1, Hoxc9, Cidea</italic> and <italic>Fgf21</italic>. Interestingly, the TargetScan tool identified miR-21 binding sites within <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA. Further experiments should be carried out to ascertain whether <italic>Ucp1, Hoxc9, Cidea</italic> and <italic>Fgf21</italic> are direct target genes of miR-21.</p>
<p>Our comprehensive study allowed us to build a potential regulatory model that proposed that miR-21 regulates browning and thermogenesis through several ways: 1) VEGF-A signaling pathway, 2) p53 signaling pathway and 3) TGF&#x03B2;1 pathway (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref></bold>). In the line with our suggestions, <italic>Vegf-A</italic> has been described to be a miR-21 target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lei <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>) and has also been described to induce the expression of <italic>Pgc-1&#x03B1;</italic> and <italic>Ucp1</italic> in both mouse BAT and WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Elias <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>) and then, this factor regulates energy homeostasis and has a protective effect against obesity and IR, not only by angiogenesis regulation but also through the induction of BAT thermogenesis and WAT browning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Elias <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). As illustrated in <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>, the activation of <italic>Ucp1</italic> by miR-21 could also occur through pathways involving <italic>Fgf21, Prdm16</italic> and <italic>Ppar-&#x03B3;</italic>. In fact, <italic>Fgf21</italic> has been well described to induce thermogenesis in BAT and browning in WAT by activating <italic>Pgc-1&#x03B1;</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coskun <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fisher <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). <italic>Pgc-1&#x03B1;</italic> and <italic>Prdm16</italic> have also been shown to induce the expression of <italic>Ucp1</italic> and other thermogenic components and to regulate energy homeostasis and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Puigserver <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tiraby <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Villanueva <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Moreover, miR-21 could act on browning and thermogenic processes through the inhibition of <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>Tgf&#x03B2;1</italic>, two validated miR-21target genes that were downregulated in both the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> miR-21 mimic treatment. These two target genes have been well described to inhibit differentiation and thermogenesis in BAT, to regulate the formation of beige cells in WAT and to be related to obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yadav <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hallenborg <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, our data suggest the benefits of increasing miR-21 levels in AT as a potential therapy against weight gain which likely prevents the switch to an unhealthy metabolic phenotype. In this regard, we found that high levels of miR-21 in both VAT and SAT were associated with metabolically healthy obesity defined by a low degree of insulin resistance in humans and the absence of T2D in mice. Consistent with our findings, previous studies reported that miR-21 is highly expressed in human SAT, and correlated with BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Keller <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). In addition, an increase in miR-21 has been observed in the VAT of HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice compared to that of low-fat diet-fed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chartoumpekis <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Overall, our human and mice transversal studies support the potential role of miR-21 exogenous increase for the regulation of WAT functionality and expansion and suggest that high levels of miR-21 in AT could be a protective mechanism that allows obese subjects to remain metabolically healthy. This hypothesis is in agreement with our previous results which pointed out the upregulation of VEGF-A expression as a defense mechanism against obesity-associated metabolic alterations such as IR and T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tinahones <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Here we can add that this VEGF-A increase could be triggered by miR-21, as both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> miR-21 mimic administration led to an increase in <italic>Vegf-A</italic> gene expression. Future analyses should be carried out to address these hypotheses.</p>
<p>In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this study adds novel findings that highlight the role of miR-21 as a promising potential therapeutic strategy for limiting weight gain and maintaining metabolic health.</p>

<title>Study design for <italic>In vivo</italic> treatment of 45% HFD fed mice with miR-21 mimic</title>
<p>To obtain obese mice, a group of mice were fed a HFD containing 45% of kcal from saturated fat for 8 weeks (45% HFD). Body weight was monitored twice a week. After 8 weeks of feeding, glucose tolerance was assessed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT) (Fig. S1). Body weight and glucose areas under the curves (AUCs) were calculated using the initial weight before starting DIO and basal glucose after 10-12 hours of fasting as the basal point (0) for each mouse (Fig. S1). In this step of the <italic>in vivo</italic> study, the 45% HFD mice group was compared in parallel with a control group of age-matched mice which were fed a control diet containing 10% of kcal from fat (LFD) in order to ensure that the 45% HFD mice group had significant differences in weight and glucose tolerance compared to 10% LFD group (control diet) after 8 weeks of diet, which indicates that miR-21 <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment can be started. The control diet group was then discarded, as the study was focused mainly on obese mice. The obese mice were separated into three subgroups: 1) a group treated three times a week for 8 weeks with subcutaneous injection of 0.5&#x03BC;g miR-21 mimic (n=8) (Riboxx, M-00303-0100) dissolved in jetPEI vehicle (0.08&#x03BC;l) (polyplus transfection, 201-50G); 2) a group treated three times a week for 8 weeks with mimic control (n=9) (Qiagen, AllStars Neg. Control siRNA) dissolved in jetPEI vehicle; and 3) a group treated three times a week for 8 weeks with jetPEI vehicle (n=4). All animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Blood and AT biopsies, BAT, interscapular white AT (intWAT), inguinal AT (ingWAT) and visceral AT (VAT), were obtained during dissection and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C. The number of mice in each experiment is stated in the figure legends (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants for the human study on miR-21 expression</title>
<p>Obese subjects were included in this study based on the inclusion criterion of morbid obesity (BMI[40) within two groups. The first group contains subjects who are morbidly obese with low insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) &#x003C;3.55) (LIR-MO, n=9). The second group contains subjects who are morbidly obese with high insulin resistance (HOMA-IR&#x003E;6.73) (HIR-MO, n=9). The morbidly obese subjects included in this study (n=18) received bariatric surgery at the Hospital Cl&#x00ED;nico Virgen de la Victoria. Control subjects were non-diabetic normoweight individuals with HOMA-IR&#x003C; 3.55 (NW) (BMI=18.5-24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, n=7) who were operated for hiatal hernia or cholelithiasis, age-matched to the two morbidly obese groups, and with the same inclusion criteria. The exclusion criteria were (1) T2D with medical treatment, (2) major cardiovascular disease in the 6 months prior to inclusion in the study, (3) evidence of acute or chronic inflammatory disease, (4) infectious diseases, and (5) refusal of the patient to participate in the study. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the V&#x00ED;rgen de la Victoria Clinical University Hospital (M&#x00E1;laga, Spain). The biochemical and anthropometric characteristics of these subjects are shown in Table S4. The anthropometric measurements of the morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) demonstrated a significantly higher BMI and waist circumference compared to those of the NW subjects (Table S4). The control normoweight subjects had no alterations in their lipid or glucose metabolism, were of a similar age as the morbidly obese group and reported that their body weight had been stable for at least 3 months prior to the study. The biochemical abnormalities associated with obesity and IR were reflected by low levels of HDL cholesterol in both LIR-MO and HIR-MO subjects compared to that of NW subjects. No differences were observed in the HOMA-IR between LIR-MO subjects and NW, while a significant difference in this index was observed between LIR-MO and HIR-MO. AT biopsies were obtained from subcutaneous and visceral (omental) areas during surgery and were frozen and stored at &#x2212;80&#x00B0;C for posterior miRNA extraction.</p>

<title>Generation of diet-induced obese and diabetic mice and study design for miR-21 expression studies</title>
<p>The C57Bl/6J strain of mice used in the present study is susceptible to developing obesity and metabolic disturbances after being fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for several weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Romero-Zerbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). As we previously described, this mouse strain on a HFD for 10 weeks led to the development of a phenotype mimicking that of human obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Romero-Zerbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Briefly, C57BL/6J mice (11 weeks old at arrival) were purchased from Charles River, France, and were allowed to acclimatize in the animal facility for one week prior to the experiments. Mice were singly housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle (8:00&#x25A1;pm lights off) in a room with controlled temperature (21&#x25A1;&#x00B1;&#x25A1;2&#x00B0;C) and humidity (50&#x25A1;&#x00B1;&#x25A1;10%) and free access to pelleted chow (Standard Rodent Diet A04, SAFE, Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) and water. The study was carried out in three groups of mice: mice fed with control diet (control), non-diabetic obese mice (45% HFD for 8 weeks; 45% HFD-ob) and obese diabetic mice (45% HFD for 14 weeks; 45% HFD-diabetic) (<bold>Fig. S1A</bold>). Specifically, to obtain obese non-diabetic mice (45% HFD-ob), a group of eight mice were fed a control diet containing 10% of kcal (control diet) (D12450 Research Diets Inc) for 6 weeks and then were fed, for further 8 weeks, a HFD (D12451 Research Diets Inc, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) containing 45% of Kcal from saturated fat (HFD (45% HFD<bold>)</bold>. To obtain diabetic obese mice a group of eight mice were fed a HFD containing 45% of kcal from saturated fat for 14 weeks (45% HFD-diabetic). A control group of mice were fed a control diet containing 10% of Kcal from fat (control) for the 14 weeks (<bold>Fig. S3A</bold>). Twice a week, body weight was monitored. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Romero-Zerbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>), at week 13, the 45% HFD mice group displayed a significant difference in body weight gain compared to control diet group (<bold>Fig. S3B</bold>). After 14 weeks of feeding, glucose and insulin tolerance were assessed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT and ITT) (<bold>Fig. S3C</bold>). Then, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Moreover, the group of diabetic obese mice showed significant alterations in GTT and ITT compared to the control diet group (<bold>Fig. S3C</bold>). Tissues were immediately collected for further histological and biochemical analyses. The European Union recommendations (2010/63/EU) on animal experimentation were followed. All procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Malaga (authorization no. 2012&#x2013;0061A).</p>

<title>Glucose and insulin tolerance tests</title>
<p>Both the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were assessed after eight weeks and 17 weeks of diet (control diet and diet-induced obesity) in the generation of diet-induced obese mice (Fig. S3).

<p>Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 g/kg of D-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) after 10-12 hours of fasting before starting the treatment with miR-21 mimic and at the end of treatment. Blood glucose was measured at 0 (basal), 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120 minutes from the tail vein using a glucometer (Accu-check, Roche Diagnostic, Barcelona, Spain).</p>
<p>ITT was performed by injecting 0.5 U/kg of insulin intraperitoneally (Humulin, France) after 10-12 hours of fasting. Blood drops were collected from the tail vein, and glucose was measured with a glucometer at 0 (basal), 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120 minutes.

<title>Food intake and open field (OFT) tests</title>
<p>Five weeks after treatment, food intake test was performed by weighing mice and food pellets for 5 days. Daily kcal consumption was calculated based on the high-fat diet. OFT was performed to measure the locomotor activity of obese mice treated with miR-21 mimic and control mimic. Mice were moved to the experimental room and kept there for 30 minutes before starting the test. Then, each mouse was placed in the middle of the open field arena for 10 minutes, and variables such as the time and distance walked in the center, entries into the center and overall distance traveled were measured using by video tracking SMART software.</p>

<p>18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET (18F-FDG PET) imaging was performed at the Unidad de Imagen Molecular, CIMES, Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Prieto <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Animals (n=6; 34.33 &#x00B1; 3.2 g) fasted overnight, were anesthetized by inhalation of a mixture of isoflurane/oxygen (5% for induction and 2% for maintenance) and placed prone on a PET scanner bed 1 hour after intraperitoneal radiotracer administration (10.36 &#x00B1; 2.22 MBq) to perform a static acquisition of 30 minutes. Images were subsequently reconstructed using an iterative 3-D row action maximum likelihood algorithm (3-D RAMLA). Corrections for dead time decay and random coincidences were applied. Images were reconstructed on a 128 x 128 x 120 matrix, where the voxel size equals 1 x 1 x 1 mm. PET images were normalized using the whole brain average uptake with PMOD software (3.3 PMOD Technologies Ltd., Zurich, Switzerland). The inguinal AT region of interest (ROI) was manually drawn.</p>
<p>Animals were kept at 25&#x00B0;C to maintain BAT activity as low as possible and to ensure that differences in thermogenic activity were only due to treatment. The blood glucose concentration (88.83 &#x00B1; 6.88 mg/dl) was determined before tracer injection using a glucose level meter with test strips (Accu-Check Aviva Nano, Roche, Mannheim, Germany).</p>

<p>AT samples were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 48 hours and then placed and processed in paraffin Spin Tissue Processor STP 120 to allow the infiltration of paraffin into the tissue. Infiltrated samples were then embedded in paraffin using the paraffin embedding center (EG1150H, Leica, Nussloch, Germany). The tissue was cut into sections of up to 5 &#x03BC;m thick. After sample deparaffinization, nuclear staining was carried out with Harris hematoxylin, followed by cytoplasmic staining with a mixture of eosin and 0.2% glacial acetic acid. The slides were dehydrated through a series of increasing grades of ethanol solutions. All sections were photographed using an Olympus BX61 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
<p>Immunofluorescence was performed by incubating the samples in PBS plus 0.3% Triton X-100, 10% donkey serum (DS) and 10% sheep serum (SS) for 1 hour.

<title>Interactions among miRNAs, biological processes, and miR-21 target genes</title>
<p>The interactions among miR-21, biologic processes, and the TGs were visualized with Cytoscape version 3.2.1 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cytoscape.org/">https://www.cytoscape.org/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Statistical analyses and graphics were carried out using GraphPad Prism 5.00.288 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22. All data are expressed as the mean &#x00B1; SEM. Comparisons between multiple groups were performed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni&#x2019;s post hoc test, and comparisons between two groups were performed by Student&#x2019;s t-test. GTT, ITT and body weight were analyzed by repeated two-way ANOVA measurements. p&#x25A1;0.05 was considered statistically significant. In the PET study, significant differences between groups were determined using a 2-tailed 2-sample unequal variance Student&#x2019;s t-test in Microsoft Excel. A p&#x003C;0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.</p>
