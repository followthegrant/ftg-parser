<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The extent to which use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) for smoking reduction leads to cigarette abstinence in smokers with no plans to quit smoking is unclear. This exploratory analysis examined the effects of ENDS delivering different amounts of nicotine on cigarette abstinence up to 24-week follow-up, in comparison to placebo or a behavioral substitute.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This four-arm parallel-group, randomized placebo-controlled trial took place at two academic medical centers in USA (Penn State Hershey and Virginia Commonwealth University). Participants were current adult smokers (N=520) interested in reducing but not planning to quit. They received brief advice and were randomized to one of four 24-week conditions, receiving either an eGo-style ENDS paired with 0, 8 or 36 mg/ml nicotine liquid (double-blind) or a cigarette-shaped tube, as a cigarette substitute (CS). Self-reported daily cigarette consumption and exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) were measured at all study visits. Outcomes included intent-to-treat, self-reported 7-day cigarette abstinence, biochemically confirmed by exhaled CO at 24 weeks after randomization.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>At 24 weeks, significantly more participants in the 36 mg/ml condition (14/130, 10.8&#x0025;) than in the 0 mg/ml condition (1/130, 0.8&#x0025;) and the CS condition (4/130, 3.1&#x0025;) were abstinent (relative risk = 14 [95&#x0025; CI=1.9-104.9] and 3.5 [95&#x0025; CI=1.2-10.4], respectively). The abstinence rate in the 8 mg/ml condition was 4.6&#x0025; (6/130).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>When smokers seeking to reduce smoking tried ENDS, few quit smoking in the short term. However, if smokers continued to use an ENDS with cigarette-like nicotine delivery, a greater proportion completely switched to ENDS, as compared with placebo or a cigarette substitute.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>IMPLICATIONS</title>
<p>The extent to which use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) for smoking reduction leads to cigarette abstinence in smokers with no plans to quit smoking was unclear. This randomized trial found that ENDS with nicotine delivery approaching that of a cigarette are more effective in helping ambivalent smokers to quit cigarette smoking.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Many smokers who try electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) do so intending to reduce or quit smoking<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and some continue to &#x201C;dual use&#x201D;. The extent to which ENDS use for smoking reduction leads to increased cessation in smokers with no initial plans to quit smoking remains unclear.</p>
<p>An expert committee of National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine <sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> concluded that there is limited evidence that ENDS may be effective smoking cessation aids, and moderate evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that ENDS with nicotine are more effective than ENDS without nicotine. Since that report, some additional RCTs have found that ENDS increase smoking cessation rates<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, but others did not<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Most RCTs of ENDS for smoking cessation to date have used ENDS with unknown or very low nicotine delivery, and many ENDS deliver very little nicotine relative to a cigarette<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This report is based on exploratory analyses of a randomized placebo-controlled trial that was primarily designed to examine the effects of ENDS use on toxicant exposure in smokers. The methods and results for the primary toxicant outcome (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol, NNAL) have been reported elsewhere<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The primary outcome paper reported that participants assigned to 36 mg/ml nicotine ENDS reduced NNAL, exhaled carbon-monoxide (CO) and cigarette consumption<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Here we report on exploratory analyses that were planned prior to the data set being unblinded, and were designed to examine the effects of ENDS with differing nicotine delivery profiles<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> on cigarette abstinence among current smokers with no plans to quit. We hypothesized &#x201C;ECIG nicotine concentration-related reductions in combustible cigarette use&#x201D; (SAP, p5), i.e. that the 36 mg/ml nicotine concentration ENDS would result in greater cigarette abstinence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 520 adult cigarette smokers of &#x2265;10 cigarettes per day (CPD) who were interested in reducing their cigarette consumption by fifty percent but had no plans to quit within the next 6 months. For inclusion, volunteers were required to be aged 21-65, blow an exhaled CO of &#x003E; 9 parts per million (ppm) at assessment and not have made any quit attempt or used a smoking cessation medication in the prior month. Participants could have used an ENDS product before, but not for more than 5 days out of the prior 28 days. Exclusions included any reported medical disorder/medication that may affect participant safety or biomarker data (e.g. pregnancy, unstable serious medical or psychiatric conditions, or weekly or greater use of illegal drugs). Full inclusion/exclusion criteria have been published<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and are available in the Supplement 1.</p>
<p>Recruitment occurred between July 22, 2015, and November 16, 2017, and follow-ups completed June 2018, at Penn State Medical Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania, (n=300), and Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia, (n=220), both in USA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This was a four-arm, parallel-group, placebo-controlled randomized trial, with the three ENDS conditions administered double-blind<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Participants were randomized to one of four 24-week conditions and received either an eGo-style ENDS paired with 0, 8, or 36 mg/ml nicotine liquid, with tobacco or menthol flavor (participants chose flavor), or a cigarette-shaped plastic tube with no electronics or aerosol, for use as a cigarette substitute (CS). Study products were provided at no cost for up to 24 weeks. In previous laboratory studies, after 10 puffs over 5 minutes on the same ENDS device used in this trial, the 8 mg/ml and 36 mg/ml liquids gave a boost to blood nicotine concentrations of 6 ng/ml and 13 ng/ml<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The 36 mg/ml nicotine liquid used with this device therefore delivers a nicotine boost approaching that resulting from smoking a cigarette (around 15 ng/ml)<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Participants were recruited via study advertisements including print, radio and online methods. They attended a screening visit and at the subsequent randomization visit (week 0), were asked to use their assigned product to help reduce their cigarette consumption by 50&#x0025; through week 2 and then by 75&#x0025; or more thereafter (relative to baseline). Instructions for participants were designed to be relatively simple and generic after they were informed how to use their study product. For example, at the randomization visit, all participants were told, &#x201C;<italic>As you learned during the consent process, you are being asked to reduce your traditional cigarette consumption throughout this study. Tomorrow, you will cut back on the number of cigarettes you smoke per day by half. This means that if you smoke 20 cigarettes per day, you will now smoke no more than 10 cigarettes per day. Remember the study product that we just discussed? You should use that study product to replace the cigarettes that you normally smoke</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At visit 4 (day 14), participants were told: <italic>&#x201C;During the next 14 days, you will be asked to reduce your cigarette consumption a bit more. Previously, we asked you to reduce your cigarette consumption by half. Now we are going to ask that you reduce your cigarette consumption by 75&#x0025; compared to your baseline level. This means that if you smoked 20 cigarettes per day at the start of this study, you will now try to smoke only 5 cigarettes per day</italic>.<italic>&#x201D;</italic></p>
<p>At visit 6 (day 56), participants were told: &#x201C;<italic>During the next 28 days, we want you to make sure you continue to attempt to achieve or maintain your 75&#x0025; reduction in your cigarette consumption. We also want to encourage you to continue to use your study product to replace the cigarettes you have cut out</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Participants were provided with gift cards worth approximately &#x0024;20-40 for each visit completed, up to a total of &#x0024;400 for those completing all study procedures. These payments were intended to cover time and travel expenses and were not contingent on smoking reduction. Self-reported CPD and product use recorded via a paper daily diary were used to perform a 7-day timeline follow-back procedure at each of 8 visits (at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24) during the intervention period. Exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) was measured at each visit, enabling validation of reported cigarette abstinence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Outcomes and statistical analysis</title>
<p>The original primary outcome of this trial was the carcinogen biomarker, NNAL, and the results on that outcome have been reported previously<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The trial also collected a number of additional measures and plans to conduct exploratory analyses on these were stated in the Statistical Analysis Plan (see SAP dated August 3, 2018 in Supplementary appendix 2, p16) prior to unblinded data analyses being initiated. Consistent with this SAP prior to unblinded analyses being undertaken, the cigarette abstinence-related outcomes are <bold>(a)</bold> intent-to-treat, self-reported 7-day point prevalence cigarette abstinence (PPA), biochemically confirmed by exhaled CO&#x003C;10ppm (7-day PPA) for each visit up to 24 weeks after randomization (last visit of randomized phase of the trial), with those not attending visits counted as smoking. Additional outcomes included <bold>(b)</bold> self-reported 28 or more days of cigarette abstinence at week 24 (biochemically validated by exhaled CO&#x003C;10ppm at weeks 20 and 24), <bold>(c)</bold> the number (&#x0025;) of participants in each group who reported at least one full day without smoking a cigarette (no biochemical verification), from week 1 to week 24, and <bold>(d)</bold> the total number of days on which participants self-reported being abstinent from cigarettes from week 1 to week 24. The parent study was originally powered to detect effects on toxicant exposure (NNAL)<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, rather than cigarette abstinence, but with 130 participants/group, there was 75&#x0025; power to detect as significant (p&#x003C;0.05, 2-tailed) a difference of 9&#x0025; (e.g. 3&#x0025; v 12&#x0025;) between 2 groups, using Fisher&#x2019;s exact test (post-hoc power calculation). Fisher&#x2019;s exact tests were used to compare proportions abstinent between groups. Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to compare number of days of abstinence. 95&#x0025; confidence intervals of differences were calculated.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at both institutions. The original study protocol is published<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and statistical analysis plan prior to unblinded analysis is available in Supplement 2. This study followed the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline for randomized clinical trials.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>The main baseline characteristics of the four randomized groups are presented in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, showing that they were well matched. The CONSORT diagram (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) shows that overall, 332 participants (63.8&#x0025;) continued to attend through to 24 weeks with no significant between-group difference in dropout rates<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>

</fig>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, few participants in any group reported 7-day PPA within the first four weeks, when trying to reduce cigarette consumption by 50&#x0025; and then 75&#x0025;. However, over time more participants in the 36 mg/ml group achieved cigarette abstinence. At 24 weeks post-randomization, significantly more participants in the 36 mg/ml group than in the 0 mg/ml and CS groups were cigarette abstinent (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The mean exhaled CO among validated quitters in each group was &#x003C;3ppm, as compared with 23 ppm at baseline. Participants randomized to 36 mg/ml were more likely to report at least one or more days of cigarette abstinence throughout the trial, at least 28 days abstinence at week 24, and more total days of cigarette abstinence (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>All 14 participants in the 36 mg/ml group who were abstinent at 24 weeks were using their assigned product when they first achieved abstinence (an average of 95 days earlier), and 12/14 of those abstainers (86&#x0025;) were still using it at week 24.</p>
<p>Serious adverse events during the intervention period were spread evenly across the conditions (CS, 11; 0 mg/ml, 7; 8mg/ml, 5 and 36 mg/ml, 8) and none were judged to be related to study participation<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this study is the first ENDS RCT in which a significant increase in cigarette abstinence compared with placebo ENDS and an alternative non-nicotine cigarette substitute, were observed. The abstinence rates were not high, and this is not surprising in daily smokers who expressed no plans to quit smoking at the start of the trial, who were encouraged to reduce smoking, and were given no explicit instructions to quit smoking during the trial. The extremely low quit rates in the placebo and CS groups (&#x003C;1&#x0025; and 3&#x0025; at week 24) confirm that our study protocol did not stimulate spontaneous quitting.</p>
<p>While the ENDS with cigarette-like nicotine delivery (36 mg/ml) produced a marked increase in cigarette abstinence, there was no discernable beneficial effect on cigarette abstinence of the lower nicotine delivery ENDS. This result is consistent with dose-response effects on smoking cessation found with nicotine replacement therapies<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. It suggests that policies that decrease the likelihood that smokers can identify and/or purchase ENDS that deliver nicotine as effectively as a combustible cigarette may have the unintended consequence of reducing the number of smokers who successfully quit smoking by switching from cigarettes to ENDS.</p>
<p>This study&#x2019;s limitations include use of one ENDS device and no flavored liquids (other than tobacco and menthol), participant drop-out (36&#x0025;), and a relatively short length of cigarette abstinence at 24 weeks. Strengths include randomized double-blind allocation to different liquid nicotine conditions, use of an ENDS device with known nicotine delivery profile, both placebo and non-ENDS control groups, and biochemical validation of self-reported abstinence.</p>

<title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>When smokers seeking to reduce smoking try ENDS, few quit smoking in the short term. However, if smokers continue to use an ENDS with cigarette-like nicotine delivery, a greater proportion completely switch to ENDS, as compared with placebo or a cigarette substitute. ENDS with nicotine delivery approaching that of a cigarette are more effective in enabling ambivalent cigarette smokers to quit smoking.</p>
