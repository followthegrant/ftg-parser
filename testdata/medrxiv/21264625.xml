<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Soil-transmitted helminth infections represent a large burden across the globe with over a quarter of the world&#x2019;s population at risk. The outcome of available treatments is species-specific with a large proportion of unexplained treatment failure. Administration of albendazole is the standard of care, but because of low cure rates (CR) observed in treating <italic>Trichuris trichiura</italic> infections, a significantly more efficacious alternative therapy combining albendazole and ivermectin is being investigated.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>80 patients from the village of Pak-Khan, in Laos, with confirmed STH infections (<italic>Trichuris trichiura</italic> and hookworms), received either albendazole (400 mg) or albendazole (400 mg) and ivermectin (200 &#x00B5;g/kg) together. A pre-treatment stool sample was collected as well as daily post-treatment stool samples for up to 28 days to measure treatment efficacy. Taxonomic profiling of pre-treatment stool samples was conducted using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, target-specific and total bacteria qPCR, as well as shotgun sequencing.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Three bacterial communities, or enterotypes (ET) 1-3, were identified. No association with pre-treatment enterotype and treatment outcome of both <italic>Trichuris trichiura</italic> and hookworm were found in the monotherapy arm with overall cure rates (CR) of 7.5&#x0025; and 50&#x0025;, respectively. Pre-treatment enterotype was strongly associated with efficacy of the combination therapy for both, <italic>T. trichiura</italic> (CR<sub>overall</sub> = 33.3&#x0025;; CR<sub>ET1</sub> = 5.8&#x0025;; CR<sub>ET2</sub> = 16.6&#x0025;; CR<sub>ET3</sub> = 68.5&#x0025;) and hookworm (CR<sub>overall</sub> = 47.2&#x0025;; CR<sub>ET1</sub> = 31.2&#x0025;; CR<sub>ET2</sub> = 16.6&#x0025;; CR<sub>ET3</sub> = 78.5&#x0025;) infections. Daily post-treatment egg per gram of stool counts recapitulated these observations and faster and increased egg reduction was observed in ET3 when compared to failure-associated ET1 and ET2. Species-level comparisons of these enterotypes highlighted a set of ten differentially enriched bacterial species.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Taxonomically distinct gut microbiota communities were found in this setting in terms of both, relative and absolute abundances, of specific bacterial taxa. Pre-treatment enterotype was relevant for treatment outcome of the combination therapy, albendazole and ivermectin, for <italic>T. trichiura</italic> as well as for hookworm infections. These observations indicate that pre-treatment microbial composition of stool samples should be monitored to ensure evidence-based administration of albendazole-ivermectin to treat these diseases.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over 25&#x0025; of the world&#x2019;s population is at risk being of infected by soil-transmitted helminth (STH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura</italic> and hookworms (<italic>Ancylostoma duodenale</italic> and <italic>Necator americanus</italic>) account for most STH infections and the current recommended treatment is mainly based on two benzimidazole drugs, albendazole and mebendazole, which display varying species-specific treatment efficacies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. For instance, a single-dose regimen of either drug will achieve poor cure rates treating <italic>T. trichiura</italic> infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> while displaying high efficacy against <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns, which represent the main control strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, can lead to increased selective pressure towards resistant parasites. Yet, the drug pipeline for new drug candidates remains empty despite recent efforts to discover novel drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and relies mainly on repurposing existing drugs from veterinary medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The use of drug combinations, e.g. albendazole with ivermectin, has recently been advertised to broaden the spectrum of activity of treatments against soil-transmitted helminthiasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Ivermectin is a derivate of avermectin, which was initially isolated in <italic>Streptomyces avermectinius</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. It possesses a 16-membered macrocyclic lactone group and thus belongs to the macrolide drug class, which also encompasses antibiotic drugs such as azithromycin and erythromycin, used to treat mostly gram-positive bacterial infections. Ivermectin is commonly used in the veterinary field and has been shown to improve efficacy of single-dose treatment against <italic>T. trichiura</italic> when administered in combination with albendazole<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, in a recent multi-country randomized controlled trial, varying treatment efficacy of albendazole-ivermectin against <italic>T. trichiura</italic> was observed with cure rates ranging from 8&#x0025; to 66&#x0025; in different settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>One potential confounder of drug treatment efficacy is the dense and diverse non-parasitic gut microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Its pivotal role in treatment outcome is currently being investigated in different fields, including cancer research and metabolic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. However, there is still very limited information pertaining to its role in the context of neglected tropical diseases and more specifically how it affects treatment efficacy of essential drugs such as benzimidazoles for STH infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Various mechanisms of drug-microbe interactions have been identified but can broadly be categorized into either direct or indirect mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Direct metabolization of drugs by gut microbes most often result in modulation of potency and/or toxicity is a widespread mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Indirect mechanisms include, but are not limited to, local microbe-driven mechanisms of tampered gut wall function, resulting in deregulated drug translocation into systemic circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to identify potential inter-kingdom mechanisms of resilience (i.e. = bacteria modulating anti-parasitic drug efficacy) in the treatment of <italic>T. trichiura</italic> and hookworm infections. Understanding possible interactions between gut microbes and anthelminthic drugs could help to improve and optimize current treatment efficacy while avoiding selection towards resistant microbial communities. In the framework of this randomized trial, we assessed efficacy of two anthelminthic treatments, albendazole alone (400 mg), and in combination with ivermectin (200 &#x00B5;g/kg), in the context of gut microbial communities. We conducted taxonomic profiling of gut microbial communities on pre-treatment stool samples to predict treatment efficacy assessed by post-treatment egg reduction rates. Microbial community composition was determined using several techniques, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 16S- and taxon-specific qPCR, as well as shotgun sequencing to identify species-level taxonomic features associated with treatment outcome.</p>

<title>Sampling results and study characteristics</title>
<p>Between January and May 2019, people from ten villages in Nambak, Luang Prabang district in Laos were tested for <italic>T. trichiura</italic>. 549 people were included and randomly assigned to either monotherapy (albendazole) or combination therapy (albendazole-ivermectin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Daily post-treatment stool samples were collected from a subset of 88 patients up to 28 days after first administration, among which 80 were included for microbiome assessment (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>). Among these, 86.2&#x0025; (n=69) were also co-infected with hookworms, 40&#x0025; (n=32) with <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic>, and 8.7&#x0025; (N=7) with <italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic>. Treatment arms were balanced in terms of sex, age, baseline infection intensities for any helminths, and no noteworthy between-group differences were observed (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). Similarly, sampling compliance in the post-treatment period was comparable between both treatment arms (<bold>Figure S1</bold>).</p>

<title>Compositional clustering and cluster-specific taxonomic features</title>
<p>Unsupervised clustering based on taxonomic composition before treatment enabled identification of underlying community structures into three distinct clusters, or enterotypes (ET1-3), as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>. The proportion represented by each enterotype was comparable between both treatment arms (<bold>Figure S2</bold>). Accuracy of this enterotype-based classification was 78.75&#x0025; with a Kappa statistic of 62.93&#x0025; when assessed using a random forest model. Most important taxonomic features in terms of classification accuracy included the genera <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> (2.704&#x0025;), <italic>Escherichia/Shigella</italic> complex (2.613&#x0025;), <italic>Prevotella</italic> (1.814&#x0025;), <italic>Phascolarctobacterium</italic> (1.082&#x0025;), and [<italic>Eubacterium</italic>] <italic>coprostanoligenes</italic> group (1.044&#x0025;) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Relative abundances of <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic> were significantly higher in ET1 (<italic>P</italic> = 2.61E-09 and 7.55E-05, respectively), <italic>Escherichia/Shigella</italic> in ET2 (<italic>P</italic> = 1.33E-07), and [<italic>Eubacterium</italic>] <italic>coprostanoligenes</italic> group was enriched in ET3 (<italic>P</italic> = 7.55E-05) among a set of eight genera found to be differentially abundant between the three enterotypes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). Taxonomic composition was homogeneous when comparing baseline samples from both treatment arms with PERMANOVA (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.013, <italic>P</italic> = 0.38), as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>.</p>

<title>Taxon-specific absolute abundances and total bacteria confirm presence of different community structures</title>
<p>Absolute abundances of <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> (FAEC), <italic>Escherichia</italic> (ESCH), and <italic>Prevotella</italic> (PREV) assessed through qPCR confirmed the 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based enterotype classification (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). For instance, ESCH was significantly higher in ET2 than in both ET1 and ET3 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001 and 0.002). Similarly, FAEC and PREV were both significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.004, respectively) in ET1 than in ET3. We then tested whether qPCR values obtained from these three targets and total bacterial load (16S) could be used to discriminate between these microbial signatures. The qPCR-based random forest model accurately classified 83.1&#x0025; of samples (Kappa = 0.72) into enterotypes 1-3, which is similar to the metrics obtained with the sequencing-based classification. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of this model were of 1 (95&#x0025;CI = N.A) between ET1 and ET2, of 0.88 (95&#x0025;CI = 0.79-0.97) between ET1 and ET3, and of 0.91 (95&#x0025;CI = 0.82-1) between ET2 and ET3 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>) indicating the suitability of qPCR-based classification into an identified enterotype as an alternative to high-throughput sequencing.</p>

<title>Association of identified enterotype with T. trichiura and hookworm cure</title>
<p>We did not observe any association between cure rate, defined as an average egg per gram count (EPG) equal to zero between days 14-28 post-treatment, and ET, for patients receiving albendazole monotherapy for <italic>T. trichiura</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>, right half) nor hookworm infections (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, right half). However, the majority of patients who received the combination therapy (albendazole-ivermectin) and were cured for any soil-transmitted helminth infection, presented a gut microbial composition classified as ET3 pre-treatment. This observation was similar for both, <italic>T. trichiura</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>, left half) and hookworm infections (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, left half). Likelihood of cure of <italic>T. trichiura</italic> infection was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0002) for patients presenting ET3 than those presenting ET1 at baseline with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.03 (95&#x0025;CI = 0.01-0.2). A similar, albeit weaker association (<italic>P</italic> = 0.025), with an OR of 0.14 (95&#x0025; CI = 0.03-0.66), was observed between ET and treatment outcome of hookworm. Absolute abundances of PREV and FAEC measured at baseline correlated with average egg counts between days 14-28 post-treatment for the combination therapy with spearman correlation coefficients of 0.416 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.009) and 0.275 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.09), respectively (<bold>Supplementary figure 3A</bold>). No correlation was observed between <italic>T. trichiura</italic> cure and absolute microbial abundances in the monotherapy arm, nor for hookworm in both treatment arms (<bold>Supplementary figure 3B-D</bold>).</p>

Notably, EPG counts increase after the initial drop for patients with ET1, and to a lesser extent, patients with ET2, for both types of infections.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the first to investigate gut microbial determinants of antiparasitic treatment failure for essential drugs used to treat human <italic>T. trichiura</italic> and hookworm infections. Our results represent a significant improvement of our understanding of gut microbiota-drug interaction in the context of anthelmintics treatment. The key findings are i) that taxonomically distinct communities were found in this setting in terms of both, relative and absolute abundance of specific taxa, and ii) that pre-treatment community composition, or enterotype, is associated with treatment outcome of the combination therapy, albendazole and ivermectin, for <italic>T. trichiura</italic> as well as for hookworm infections. These observations indicate that pre-treatment microbial composition of stool samples is strongly correlated with treatment efficiency of both <italic>T. trichiura</italic> and hookworms when using ivermectin-based treatment.</p>
<p>Ivermectin is a functionally and chemically complex drug. For instance, recent literature described the re-positioning of the drug to treat a wide range of off-label non-parasitic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. As consequence, this could lead to an increase of ivermectin consumption worldwide de facto making understanding of its interactions with the gut microbiota even more relevant for public health. Furthermore, it harbours a 16-membered macrocyclic lactone group, which is structurally similar to that found in important macrolide antibiotics including, erythromycin (14-membered lactone), azithromycin (15-membered lactone), and tyrosin/josamycin (16-membered lactone), among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. While this remains to be functionally validated, it raises the question as to whether drug resistance interactions could occur between bacteria and ivermectin, which could be driven through a potential bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity on failure-associated taxa. Further studies should investigate this direct mechanism, since several of the failure-associated taxa are gram-positive bacteria, which are known targets of macrolide antibiotics and could hence be sensitive to this drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. This is, for instance, the case of <italic>S. salivarius</italic>. Several streptococci species have been shown to harbour multiple mechanisms of macrolide resistance, including drug efflux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, target alteration through methylation (protection) of the 23S/50S complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and perhaps even more importantly in this context, to inactivate macrolide drugs through a set of drug inactivation enzymes including macrolide phosphotransferases and erythromycin esterases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Drug inactivation through bacterial enzymes could decrease the amount of active compound reaching their indicated targets - soil-transmitted helminths, and hence reduce overall treatment efficacy. Other potential mechanisms of interest identified in <italic>S. salivarius</italic> include, for instance, bioaccumulation/sequestration of drugs in bacterial cells, as recently published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. However, these hypotheses remain to be proven, and functional validation remains to be performed to understand mechanisms involved in this drug-microbe interaction. It is worth noting that this interaction is present for hookworms, which colonize the small intestine, as well as for <italic>T. trichiura</italic>, which resides in the caecum, at the beginning of the large intestine. This speaks in favour of a more widespread interaction, rather than a locally restricted event. Another key focus point of future research would also include understanding how many, among the 34-92&#x0025; of non-responders to albendazole/ivermectin-based treatment, can be attributed to potential bacteria-driven interactions. This information would help define how treatment response could be improved through a microbiome-based therapy. Therapeutic opportunities derived from these findings could, for instance, involve targeted disruption of hypothetically resistant strains or overall community displacement with fitter, macrolide-sensitive strains to mitigate resistance potential. The other important implication of this study is that ivermectin, which is marketed as an antiparasitic drug, might also contribute to selecting cross-resistant bacterial isolates, which could hinder efforts involved in antibiotic stewardship programs. This is particularly important since it is widely used in MDA campaigns. Provided this resistance interaction is functionally validated, ivermectin and a related derivative moxidectin should also be considered in antimicrobial stewardship efforts. This could be achieved by using pre-treatment screening of genetic/phenotypic determinants of resistance.</p>
<p>However, our study has several important limitations. First, our observations are based on a cohort with relatively low sample size (n = 80). Hence, data driven beta diversity-based classification might change in a larger cohort. In addition, the taxonomic determinants of failure identified in this setting might be specific to the village of Pak-Khan in Lao PDR and might not be generalizable. While we confirmed robustness of our taxonomic-related observations with different techniques, further studies in different settings are needed to pinpoint common microbial/genetic denominators of low albendazole plus ivermectin-based treatment efficacy. Second, we did not investigate intrinsic worm resistance. While there is currently no known target for screening of <italic>T. trichiura</italic> and hookworm resistance to ivermectin, we cannot exclude that lower sensitivity of the parasites might explain, in part, decreased treatment efficacy. While this could be the case, our efficacy-related observations (66&#x0025; failure) are in line with previous observations of failure associated with this drug combination. Since there is no evidence of parasitic resistance to ivermectin in human populations to date, we believe that the study setting is representative of an environment with normal parasitic sensitivity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we showed in this study that the gut microbiota composition is an important driver of response to anthelminthic treatment based on albendazole and ivermectin. These findings will enable understanding of the cause of albendazole and ivermectin-based treatment failure in a large proportion of patients, while still being one of the most efficacious options in terms of success to treat STH infections. This will hopefully lead to novel therapeutic opportunities based on the modulation of failure-associated features, and - perhaps more importantly &#x2013; to optimized, evidence-based use of these powerful drugs.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Sample collection and microscopy</title>
<p>Stool samples were collected within the framework of a multi-country randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of the drug combination albendazole-ivermectin against <italic>T. trichiura</italic> and concomitant helminth infections [12]. The trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Northwestern and Central Switzerland (EKNZ; BASEC Nr Req-2018-00494) and by the National Ethics Committee for Health Research in Lao PDR (No 093/NECHR). In the Nambak District where the study was conducted, Pak Khan village was selected for the daily sample collection for 28 days post-treatment based on previous good compliance and adequate number of participants living there. Prior to the start of collection, participants were informed of the aim of the daily sample collection, in addition to the consenting and information sessions conducted for the trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. At the end of each sampling week, participants having provided at least one stool sample received a small gift of cooking oil. After collection, samples were transported to the field laboratory set up at the Nambak hospital, where they were analysed by standard Kato-Katz microscopy, which has been described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. A small aliquot of &#x003C; 1g stool was transferred to a 2ml screwcap cryotube using a UV-sterilised plastic spatula and immediately frozen at -20&#x00B0;C. After conclusion of the respective trial stage, the frozen samples were shipped directly to Swiss TPH on dry ice and kept at-20&#x00B0;C until analysis.</p>

<title>16S rRNA gene and shotgun sequencing</title>
<p>The V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Briefly, amplifications reactions were performed using 12.5 &#x00B5;l of Kapa HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) mix, 1.5 &#x00B5;l of 10 &#x00B5;M forward and reverse primers, 7.5 &#x00B5;l of sterile water, and 2 &#x00B5;l of template DNA. The V4 region was amplified by cycling the reaction at 95&#x00B0;C for 3 minutes, 30x cycles of 95&#x00B0;C for 15 seconds, 50&#x00B0;C for 15 seconds and 72&#x00B0;C for 15 seconds, followed by a 5 minutes 72&#x00B0;C extension. To avoid bias associated with PCR amplification, all reactions were done in triplicate, visually controlled on a 1.2&#x0025; agarose and subsequently pooled together. Each pool was quantified using a Qubit hsDNA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The purified library was loaded onto an Illumina Miseq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Sequencing was performed using V3 chemistry (600 cycles) in 2x 300bp mode. Shallow shotgun sequencing was conducted as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Briefly, we generated a 4.4-13.3 M reads per sample to ensure representative taxonomic profiling with a better taxonomic resolution than what is allowed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. DNA concentration was measured from 2 ul isolated DNA using a Qubit 4.0 in combination with hsDNA quantification kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA kits (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) according to the manufacturers protocol. Final libraries were quantified and pooled together in an equimolar mix. The pool was subsequently loaded onto an Illumina NextSeq sequencer and sequenced using a Mid-output kit (300 cycles) in paired-end mode (2x 150bp).
