<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is a common feature of severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and frequently requires respiratory support. As invasive mechanical ventilation carries high morbidity and mortality, other respiratory modalities, such as high-flow nasal oxygen and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) by face mask and helmet, have been suggested and increasingly practiced. Helmet NIV has multiple advantages over other modalities that may include more effective seal, less transmission of the virus, more effective delivery of positive end-expiratory pressure, and greater tolerance.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) Helmet NIV has been investigated as a treatment in adult patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) A network meta-analysis of 25 studies that included 3804 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure for reasons other than COVID-19 found significant lower intubation (risk ratio, 0.26; 95&#x0025; credible interval, 0.14-0.46) and mortality (risk ratio, 0.40; 95&#x0025; credible interval, 0.24-0.63) risks with helmet NIV compared with standard oxygen therapy.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) The absence of high-quality evidence on helmet NIV in COVID-19 led to the design and conduct of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Recently, an RCT compared the early application of 48 hours of helmet NIV or HFNO in 109 patients with moderate to severe hypoxemia (ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio &#x2264; 200) showed no difference in the number of days free of respiratory support at 28 days (primary outcome) with a significantly lower incidence of intubation and a higher number of invasive mechanical ventilation&#x2013;free days at 28 days in the helmet NIV group.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)</p>
<p>The helmet non-invasive ventilation for COVID-19 patients (Helmet-COVID) trial is a concealed, stratified, unblinded multicenter RCT that examines the effect of helmet NIV compared to usual care on 28-day mortality in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. The full trial protocol has been published previously.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>)</p>
<p>In this manuscript, we describe the statistical analysis plan (SAP) of the helmet COVID trial. This plan complies with the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, and both the &#x201C;Statistical principles for clinical trials E9&#x201D; and &#x201C;Structure and content of clinical study reports E3&#x201D;.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) The report describes the procedures for the primary and secondary analyses. All analyses were prospectively defined as the SAP was finalized during trial implementation. The SAP was written by the Principal Investigator and members of the Steering committee, who will remain blinded to the study results until all patients have been recruited and the database has been locked. Participant recruitment is expected to be complete in the summer of 2021. The final study report will follow the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 guidelines for reporting RCTs.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>)</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>The Helmet-COVID trial will enroll 320 critically ill patients in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The study has been approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the participating sites. The trial is registered in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT04477668). The study is sponsored by King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (Protocol number RC20/306/R), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The sponsor has no role in the study design, management, or analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>All adult (adult ICU cut-off age) patients admitted to the ICU with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription&#x2013;polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) will be screened for eligibility. Inclusion criteria include acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fraction (percent) of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio) &#x003C;200 despite supplemental oxygen with a partial/non-rebreathing mask at a flow rate &#x003E;10 L/min or above) with intact airway protective gag reflex and able to follow instructions. Exclusion criteria include imminent intubation and requirement for more than one vasopressor. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is described in the published protocol.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>)</p>
<p>A flow diagram will be constructed according to the CONSORT guidelines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We will report the number of patients who were screened, met inclusion or exclusion criteria, were eligible but not enrolled with reasons for non-enrollment. We will report the number of patients who were randomized to each group, received the allocated intervention, and included in the final analysis.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="21260421v1_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p><italic>The Intention-to-treat population</italic> consists of all enrolled patients and will be used for the primary analysis. All enrolled patients will be included regardless of whether they receive or do not receive the allocated intervention. All patients enrolled with suspected COVID-19 will remain in the study, even if they tested negative for COVID-19 after enrollment. Post- enrollment exclusion from the intention-to-treat analysis will be restricted to the withdrawal of consent to use trial data by the patient or surrogate decision-maker (SDM) or wrong randomization. However, if the patient or SDM withdraws consent for trial participation but permits collection and use of data, we will include these participants in the planned intention- to-treat analysis. We plan to enroll additional patients to compensate for patients who are excluded post-randomization.</p>
<p><italic>The per-protocol population</italic> consists of all randomized patients who received the allocated intervention (helmet NIV in the helmet NIV group, and no helmet NIV in the usual care group). Patients will be considered to have received helmet NIV if the device was applied for 1 hour or more.</p>

<title>Analysis Plan</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Baseline Characteristics</title>
<p>We will present baseline characteristics in patients randomized to the helmet NIV and usual care of the intention-to-treat cohort (Supplement Table S1). We will report in the two groups patients age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, location before ICU admission (emergency room, hospital ward, other hospitals (ICU or ward), others), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, comorbidities (any chronic comorbidity, chronic cardiac, pulmonary disease, renal, liver, and neurological diseases, diabetes, any malignancy including leukemia or lymphoma and metastatic solid tumor, AIDS/HIV, rheumatologic diseases, others). Because we are enrolling patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, we will report whether the patient is eventually confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will report physiologic parameters before randomization (partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>), PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), and pH) and the number of quadrants with infiltrates on the chest radiograph. We will report respiratory support at baseline (high-flow nasal cannula, mask noninvasive ventilation, other oxygen devices). We will document respiratory rate and whether the patient is treated with awake prone positioning. We will document the number of days from onset of symptoms to the emergency room and ICU admission, and the number of days from ICU admission to randomization. We will report organ support, including vasopressor therapy and renal replacement therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Intervention Data</title>
<p>For each day in the first 96 hours, we will report in each group the details regarding helmet NIV (number of hours used, highest pressure support level, and PEEP). Throughout the first 28 days, we will document the number of days received helmet (&#x003E;1 hour) and the total hours of helmet NIV. Non-tolerance to helmet NIV is defined as not using helmet NIV for at least 1 hour. We will document the reasons for discontinuation of the helmet NIV (clinical improvement, the patient required intubation, helmet intolerance with use of &#x003C;1 hour or &#x003E;1 hour, helmet removal due to change in goals of care, death while on helmet). We will document respiratory support post helmet NIV (mask NIV, high-flow nasal oxygen, other oxygen devices, intubation). Violations to the study protocol will be documented including the use of NIV helmet in the usual group, and lack of attempt to use helmet NIV in the intervention group (Supplement Table S2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Co-Interventions</title>
<p>In both groups, we will document the use of other respiratory support modalities during the first 4 days (mask NIV with highest pressure support and PEEP, high-flow nasal cannula with flow rate, other oxygen devices, awake prone position), arterial blood gases, and fluid intake and output (Supplement Table S2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>Physiologic variables during the intervention</title>
<p>For the 28 days, we will document modalities of respiratory support, the use of sedation while not intubated (dexmedetomidine), renal replacement therapy, and vasopressors/Inotrope therapy. We will document the use of COVID-19 interventions, including corticosteroids, IL-6 receptor antagonists, and antiviral therapy. We will document serial PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio, PaCO2, fluid balance, and serial SOFA scores (Supplement Table S2).</p>

<title>Primary Outcome</title>
<p>The primary outcome is all-cause 28-day mortality. The primary outcome tests the primary hypothesis that helmet NIV reduces 28-day mortality (Supplement Table S3).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Categorical variables will be reported as numbers and frequencies and will be compared between the study groups using the Chi-square test. Continuous variables will be reported as mean and standard deviation or median and the first and third quartiles (Q1-Q3) and be compared between the study groups using the Student&#x2019;s t-test or the Wilcoxon-Mann- Whitney test, as judged appropriate by normality testing. For serial measurements, we will test the change over time and the difference between the two study groups over time using a repeated-measures analysis of variance, with no imputation for missing values. For serial measurements, we will use Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons. We will report associations as risk ratios (RR) or hazard ratios (HR) with 95&#x0025; confidence intervals (CI). Tests will be two-sided and at the 5&#x0025; significance level. All statistical analyses will be conducted using the SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The statistical analysis remains blinded to the research team until completion of primary outcome data on the study population and will be performed by the study biostatistician.

<title>Analysis of Primary outcome</title>
<p>The primary outcome will be compared in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol cohorts (effectiveness analysis) using a Chi-square test. Results will be reported as RR with 95&#x0025; CI. If there is a significant difference, we will report relative risk reduction (RRR), absolute risk reduction (ARR) or increase, and number needed to treat (or harm). The unadjusted cox- proportional hazard model will be used as a secondary analysis tool. Kaplan-Meier curves will be generated for the alternative treatment groups and a log-rank test will be used to compare distributions. Although imbalances in baseline characteristics are unlikely with the large sample size, we will conduct an adjusted logistic regression model to adjust for the following factors (defined a priori): enrolment center and respiratory support at baseline (mask NIV support versus others).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several studies have investigated helmet NIV as a treatment for acute hypoxic respiratory failure.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) A systematic review of RCTs and observational studies found that helmet NIV was associated with lower hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.43; 95&#x0025; CI, 0.26-0.69), intubation rate (odds ratio, 0.32; 95&#x0025; CI, 0.21-0.47), and complications (odds ratio, 0.6; 95&#x0025; CI, 0.4- 0.92) compared with controls.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) A meta-analysis of four RCTs (377 patients) showed that helmet NIV significantly increased the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> (&#x002B;73.4; 95&#x0025; CI, 43.9-102.9) and decreased the arterial carbon dioxide levels, intubation rate (relative risk, 0.21; 95&#x0025; CI, 0.11- 0.40) and in-hospital mortality rate (relative risk, 0.22; 95&#x0025; CI, 0.09-0.50) compared to standard oxygen therapy.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) A network meta-analysis of 25 studies that included 3804 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure for reasons other than COVID-19 found significantly lower intubation risks with helmet NIV compared with standard oxygen therapy.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) The advantages of helmet NIV over other oxygen support modalities are thought to be more prominent in patients with COVID-19. This led to the design and conduct of multiple RCTs.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) Recently, one trial (n=110) showed no difference in the number of days free of respiratory support at 28 days (primary outcome) between helmet NIV and high- flow nasal oxygen.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)</p>
<p>As the efficacy of helmet NIV to improve outcomes in severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia has not been established, the aim of the Helmet COVID trial is to compare the effectiveness of helmet NIV compared to usual care on 28 day - mortality in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure from COVID-19. The first patient was enrolled in February 8, 2021. As of May 6, 2021, 108 patients have been enrolled from 4 centers in Saudi Arabia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Helmet-COVID trial evaluates whether helmet NIV improves the outcomes of critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. It is expected to provide evidence that will inform practice regarding the use of helmet NIV for respiratory support in these patients and contribute to future clinical practice guidelines.</p>
