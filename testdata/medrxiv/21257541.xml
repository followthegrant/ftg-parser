<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>A T cell positive and B cell negative (T&#x002B;B-) flow cytometry crossmatch (FCXM) result remains a conundrum since HLA-class I antigens are expressed on both T and B cells. We investigated the frequency, HLA specificity of the antibodies and mechanisms for the T&#x002B;B- FCXM result.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We analyzed 3073 clinical FCXM tests performed in an American Society of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics accredited histocompatibility laboratory. The sera associated with the T&#x002B;B- FCXM were also tested for donor HLA IgG antibodies using LABScreen&#x2122; single antigen assays.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Among the 3073 FCXM tests, 1963 were T-B-, 811 were T-B&#x002B;, 274 were T&#x002B;B&#x002B;, and 25 were T&#x002B;B-. IgG antibodies directed at donor HLA-A, B, or Cw locus determined antigens (DSA) were identified in all 25 sera and the summed mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of DSA ranged from 212 to 53,187. Correlational analyses identified a significant association between the summed MFI of class I DSA, and the median channel fluorescence (MCF) of T cells treated with the recipient serum (Spearman rank correlation, r<sub>s</sub>=0.34, P=0.05) but not with the MCF of B cells (r<sub>s</sub>=0.23, P=0.24). We identified that differential binding of anti-HLA antibodies to T cells and B cells and the B cell channel shift threshold used to classify a B cell FCXM are potential contributors to a T&#x002B;B- FCXM result.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our analysis of 3073 FCXM, in addition to demonstrating that HLA antibodies directed at HLA-A, B or Cw locus are associated with a T&#x002B;B- result, identified mechanisms for the surprising T&#x002B;B- FCXM result.</p></sec>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for most patients with irreversible kidney failure, but pre-sensitization to donor human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and antibody-mediated rejection, undermine its full benefits. In a landmark publication, Patel and Terasaki reported that 24 of 30 kidneys transplants performed across a positive complement dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch (CDC-XM) failed in an accelerated fashion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Test systems to detect circulating antibodies at a higher sensitivity than CDC-XM have been developed, and the flow cytometry crossmatch (FCXM) is in widespread use to identify donor specific IgG antibodies (DSA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Pre-transplant FCXM results are used in many centers for optimizing donor selection, and pre-transplant T and B cell FCXM results have been associated with allograft outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. FCXM detects binding of any type of antibodies to T cells and B cells including autoantibodies and non-HLA antibodies.</p>
<p>HLA-class I antigens are expressed on T cells and B cells, and some but not all studies suggest that the cell surface expression of HLA-class I antigens is higher on B than T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Thus, a T&#x002B;B&#x002B; FCXM, rather than a T&#x002B;B-, is the expected result in the presence of HLA-class I antibodies. A T-B&#x002B; FCXM is the anticipated result in the presence of HLA-class II antibodies only since HLA-class II antigens are expressed on B cells but not on resting T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We aimed to determine the frequency, HLA-specificity of the antibodies and potential mechanisms responsible for the T&#x002B;B- FCXM. We analyzed 3073 clinical FCXM tests performed using a standardized protocol in an American Society of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics accredited Histocompatibility Laboratory and report here the frequency, HLA-specificity of the antibodies and mechanisms responsible for the T&#x002B;B- FCXM.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Isolation of mononuclear cells for FCXM test</title>
<p>Peripheral blood collected in acid citrate dextrose tubes was used for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using Ficoll-Paque&#x2122; Premium solution (GE Healthcare Biosciences AB, Pittsburgh, PA) density gradient centrifugation. Mononuclear cells from the lymph node and spleens from deceased donors were also isolated using Ficoll-Paque&#x2122; Premium solution density gradient centrifugation. The mononuclear cells from the interface were washed thrice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the red blood cells were lysed with tris ammonium chloride. PBMC were counted using either Neubauer counting chamber or LUNA&#x2122; Automated Cell Counter (Model# L20001; Logos Biosystems, Inc., Annandale, VA). Cell viability was assessed using Trypan blue exclusion test or acridine orange/propidium iodide assay. The viability of mononuclear cells exceeded 80&#x0025; in the assays reported here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Separation of serum</title>
<p>Peripheral blood collected in serum separation tubes was centrifuged at 2300 revolutions per minute for 20 minutes. The serum was collected and treated with 0.3&#x0025; sodium azide prior to storage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>FCXM</title>
<p>FCXM was performed in a 96 well V-bottom plate (Cat#3894, Corning, Inc., Corning, NY). 300,000 PBMC or mononuclear cells, isolated from the spleen or the lymph node, were incubated with 30 &#x00B5;l of negative control serum (NCS) (normal male human AB serum free of HLA-class I and II antibodies); recipient serum (RS); or positive control serum (PCS, pooled serum from highly sensitized patients with broad HLA reactivity) for 20 minutes at 22&#x00B0;C. Prior to testing, the NCS, the RS and the PCS were centrifuged at 42,030 relative centrifugal force to remove any aggregates or cryoprecipitate.</p>
<p>The mononuclear cells used as target cells in the FCXM were washed twice with wash buffer (PBS with 0.1&#x0025; FBS and 0.1&#x0025; Sodium Azide) and stained with 10 &#x00B5;l each of anti-CD3 PerCP mAb (Cat#340663; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA); anti-CD19 PE mAb (Cat#340720; BD Biosciences); and fluorescein (FITC) affinity purified F (ab&#x2019;) 2 fragment goat anti-human IgG, Fc&#x25A1;fragment specific (Cat# 109-096-098; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.; 1:200 diluted) for 30 minutes at 4&#x00B0;C. The cells were then washed once, fixed with 1&#x0025; paraformaldehyde, and FCXM was performed using BD FACS Canto II instrument and the data were analyzed using the FACSDiva software (versions 7.1.3 and 8.0.1). Lymphocytes were gated using forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC) plot. Median channel fluorescence (MCF) of goat-anti-human IgG FITC fluorescence on T cells and on B cells was measured from the histograms. Channel shift (CS) was calculated by subtracting the MCF observed with NCS from the MCF observed with the RS or PCS.</p>
<p>A T cell FCXM test was reported as positive if the MCF of T cells incubated with the RS showed a 40 CS or higher. A B cell FCXM test was reported as a positive test if the MCF of B cells incubated with the RS showed a 50 CS or higher. The CS thresholds were based on the interquartile range (IQR, calculated by subtracting the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile value from the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile value) observed in our laboratory following treatment of target mononuclear cells with NCS. In 2020 consecutive T cell FCXM performed at our center, the median MCF of T cells treated with NCS was 229 and the IQR was 39, and in 2019 consecutive B cell FCXM, the median MCF of B cells treated with NCS was 252 and the IQR was 47. In eight consecutive American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics (ASHI)-proficiency challenges involving 66 unique sera and 16 unique HLA-typed cells, the use of these CSs, 65 of 66 T cell FCXM tests and 64 of 66 B cell FCXM were concordant with the 80&#x0025; ASHI consensus result (ground truth).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Detection of Anti-HLA Antibodies</title>
<p>Sera, untreated or treated with EDTA (0.025M final concentration), were tested for the presence of anti-HLA IgG antibodies leveraging Luminex<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> bead-based multiplexing technology. Anti-HLA-class I HLA-A, B, C IgG antibodies and anti-HLA-class II HLA-DR, DQ, DP IgG antibodies were identified using LABScreen&#x2122; Single Antigen class I assay (LS1A04) and LABScreen&#x2122; Single Antigen class II assay (LS2A01), respectively (One Lambda, Inc., Canoga Park, CA). In the LABScreen Single Antigen (LSA) assay, 10 &#x00B5;l of serum samples were incubated with 2.5 &#x00B5;l of microbeads coated with HLA-class I or HLA-class II antigens, respectively, at 22&#x00B0;C for 30 minutes. The specimens were then washed thrice in 1X wash buffer (One Lambda, Inc.). The microbeads were treated with PE labeled goat-anti-human IgG polyclonal antibody (Cat#LS-AB2, One Lambda, Inc.) at 22&#x00B0;C for 30 minutes in dark and washed thrice in wash buffer. The LABScan 100/200 (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) was used for acquisition of microbead fluorescence and data analysis. Data were then exported to HLA fusion software (One Lambda, Inc.) for analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>A total of 3609 FCXM tests were performed in our laboratory from February 2014 to April 2018. We report data from 3073 FCXM tests using potential organ donor&#x2019;s cells as target cells, and after exclusion of recipient auto FCXM and repeat donor FCXM with the same result.</p>
<p>In the Lumine single antigen bead (LSA) assay, any single antigen bead with a trimmed mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of <underline>&#x003E;</underline>2000 was scored as positive for the presence of anti-HLA IgG DSA in accord with our threshold used in the ASHI Proficiency challenges. We summed MFI of class I and MFI class I and II for the correlational analyses between summed MFI and MCF of T cells and B cells treated with RS, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). We summarized the data as median and IQR and used Mann-Whitney test and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test to compare the groups. A two-sided P-value &#x003C;0.05 was considered significant. Data analysis was performed under Weill Cornell Medicine institutional review board approved protocol.</p>

<p>24 unique patients awaiting kidney transplantation contributed the 25 sera associated with the T&#x002B;B- and one patient&#x2019;s serum was tested against two different donors and the results were T&#x002B;B- in both instances. In 12 FCXM, a recent serum and a historical serum from the same patient were tested against the same donor and data analysis showed that 10 of the 12 historical sera were also T&#x002B;B- (with 2 sera being borderline T positive with CS of 31 and 39) and two were T&#x002B;B&#x002B;.</p>
<p>Eleven of the 25 T&#x002B;B- FCXM (44&#x0025;) were performed using deceased donor cells as targets and 14 (56&#x0025;) were performed using living donor cells as targets. PBMC were the targets in 22 of 25 T&#x002B;B- FCXM, and mononuclear cells isolated from spleen (n=2) or lymph node (<italic>n</italic>=1) were the targets in 3.</p>

<title>Donor HLA Antibodies Associated with the T&#x002B;B- FCXM</title>
<p>Donor HLA specific IgG antibodies directed at HLA class I antigens (&#x003E;2000 MFI) were detected in 23 of 25 sera associated with the T&#x002B;B- FCXM. In # Case 24, the MFI of IgG DSA directed at donor HLA-A1 was 1403 and the MFI of DSA directed at HLA-B57 was 1741. In Case #25, the highest MFI of DSA was 212. Analysis for HLA-class I locus specificity showed that the antibodies were often directed at more than one locus (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among the 23 sera, antibodies directed at HLA-A were identified in12, antibodies at HLA-B in 10, and antibodies at HLA-Cw in 10. Antibodies directed at HLA-class II antigens were also detected in 6 sera.</p>

<p>A mechanism for the T&#x002B;B- FCXM is that the MCF of B cells treated with the NCS was uniquely higher when the result is T&#x002B;B- FCXM compared to the B cell MCF when the result is T&#x002B;B&#x002B; FCXM or T-B&#x002B; FCXM. To investigate this possibility, we compared the MCF of B cells treated with NCS among the FCXM classified as T&#x002B;B-, T&#x002B;B&#x002B;, or T-B&#x002B; FCXM. The median (IQR) of B cell MCF was 250 (65) in the 25 T&#x002B;B- FCXM tests, 248 (49) in the 274 T&#x002B;B&#x002B; FCXM, and 254 (45) in the 811 T-B&#x002B; FCXM (P=0.2, Kruskal-Wallis test) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, a uniquely high B cell MCF was not responsible for the observed T&#x002B;B- test result.</p>

<p>Another mechanism for the T&#x002B;B- FCXM result is that the MCF of T cells treated with NCS was uniquely lower in T&#x002B;B- FCXM compared to T&#x002B;B&#x002B; or T-B&#x002B; FCXM. To investigate this possibility, we compared the MCF of T cells treated with NCS among FCXM scored as T&#x002B;B-, T&#x002B;B&#x002B; or T-B&#x002B;. The median (IQR) of T cell MCF was 230 (36) in the 25 T&#x002B;B- FCXM tests, 229 (41) in the 274 T&#x002B;B&#x002B; FCXM, and 234 (43) in the 811 T-B&#x002B; FCXM (P=0.06) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, a uniquely low T cell MCF was an unlikely contributor to the T&#x002B;B- FCXM.</p>
<p>A 50 CS is used as the threshold to classify a B cell FCXM as positive and a 40 CS to classify a T cell FCXM as positive in our laboratory. This differential cutpoint is a potential contributor to the T&#x002B;B- FCXM result. Our data analysis showed that the 50 CS applied to score a B cell FCXM as positive may have contributed to 12 of 25 T&#x002B;B- FCXM results (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Clinical Outcomes</title>
<p>Three patients (Cases #16, #23 and #24) with a T&#x002B;B- FCXM received kidney transplants at our center. All 3 received antithymocyte globulin as induction therapy and 2 (Cases # 16 and #23) received additional treatment with rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin as per our transplant center policy for patients with DSA by LSA and a positive FCXM. The third patient, case #24 without DSA by LSA assay but a T&#x002B;B- FCXM, did not receive additional therapy with rituximab or intravenous immunoglobulin. All three received maintenance therapy consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone. None had an episode of acute rejection within the first year of transplantation and have excellent kidney graft function with serum creatinine levels of 0.88 mg/dL (Case #16), 1.0 mg/dL (Case #23) and 1.36 mg/dL (Case #24) at their last follow-up visit.</p>
<p>DSA monitoring showed that the DSA directed at B50 in Case #16 decreased from pretransplant MFI of 9349 to MFI of 1911 at 1-year post-transplantation. In Case #23, pre-transplant DSA MFI of 12350 remained at the same level and the MFI was 12418 at 1-year post-transplantation. Also, pre-transplant DSA MFI of 3673 directed at HLA-Cw17 increased to MFI of 5768 at 1-year post-transplantation. This patient also developed de novo DSA directed at HLA-B42 during this time period and the MFI was 4050. There were no pre-transplant DSA above MFI &#x003E;2000 in patient # 24 and this patient did not develop de novo DSA during the first 3-months of following transplantation he was monitored.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>A systematic analysis of 3073 clinical FCXM performed using a standardized protocol in an ASHI-accredited Histocompatibility Laboratory identified that 8.4&#x0025; of the T cell positive FCXM are T&#x002B;B&#x2013;. We found that antibodies directed not only at HLA-Cw but also antibodies directed HLA-A and antibodies directed at HLA-B are associated with a T&#x002B;B&#x2013; FCXM.</p>
<p>A mechanism for the T&#x002B;B- FCXM test result is the differential expression of HLA-class I antigens on T cells and B cells. HLA-Cw antigen expression, as detected using mAb DT9, was found to be higher on T cells than B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and in this study, seven of 10 FCXM T&#x002B;B- FCXM were observed with sera containing HLA-Cw DSA. Sera with anti-HLA-Cw IgG had also been shown by others to cause T&#x002B;B- FCXM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Our findings are consistent with the earlier findings that antibodies directed at HLA-Cw antigens may contribute to a T&#x002B;B- FCXM. Importantly, we report that antibodies directed at HLA-A and antibodies directed at HLA-B are also associated with a T&#x002B;B- FCXM.</p>
<p>Our correlational analyses identified a significant association between the summed MFI of class I DSA and the MCF of T cells treated with the RS but not between the summed MFI of DSA and the MCF of B cells treated with RS. The basis for the lack of a relationship is unclear but may reflect aberrant expression of HLA class I on the B cells associated with a T&#x002B;B- FCXM and impaired binding anti-HLA antibodies. The positive association between the summed MFI of class I DSA and the MCF of T cells treated with RS in this study was modest. The lack of a strong linear relationship may be related to the LSA assay being a qualitative assay rather than quantitative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and possible confounding due to the presence of non-HLA antibodies. Our findings provide an explanation for the observation of Higgins et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> that a serum with an MFI of 591 was associated with a positive FCXM whereas a serum with an MFI of 4773 was associated with a negative FCXM.</p>
<p>We reported that the MCF of B cells treated with NCS is significantly higher than the MCF of T cells treated with NCS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The higher B cell MCF with NCS would reduce the B cell CS observed with RS and this could be a mechanism for the T&#x002B;B- FCXM result. The higher B cell MCF however is unlikely to be the major mechanism since the MCF of B cells did not differ among FCXM that were classified as T&#x002B;B-, T-B&#x002B; or T&#x002B;B&#x002B; tests.</p>
<p>It is a common practice to use a larger CS to classify a B cell FCXM as positive compared to classifying a T cell FCXM as positive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Had we applied the 40 CS threshold to classify not only T cell FCXM but also B cell FCXM, 12 of 25 T&#x002B;B- FCXM would be reclassified as a T&#x002B;B&#x002B; FCXM. Among these 12 FCXM tests, 7 of 12 would still be classified T&#x002B; FCXM if we had applied the 50 CS used for the B cell FCXM. Thus, the higher CS used to classify a B cell FCXM test is a potential contributor to only 5 of 25 T&#x002B;B- results. In this regard, the CS threshold that should be applied to classify a FCXM test as positive or negative is the Achilles&#x2019;s heel of this assay. In the FCXM, serum from a male donor of AB blood group and Rh negative and negative for anti-HLA-class I and class II IgG antibodies are used to establish baseline MCF of T cells and B cells and this serum is used as the NCS. The target cells are from heathy volunteers or potential donors. A predefined ratio of the fluorescence of the T cells and B cells treated with RS to the fluorescence of the corresponding cells treated with NCS is one approach to classify a FCXM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. A fluorescence value that is 2 or 3 standard deviations (SD) above the mean value observed with the NCS is also used to classify a FCXM as a positive or a negative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. A value that is 2 SD higher than the mean would place the observed value outside the 95&#x0025; probability and a value that is 3 SD higher would place the observed value outside the 99.7&#x0025; probability. However, this approach assumes normal distribution of fluorescence values. Fluorescence intensity is acquired using a logarithmic scale and is best estimated using median rather than mean, and the distribution of fluorescence values of T cells and B cells treated with NCS is seldom normally distributed. Indeed, the MCF values in the 3073 FCXM analyzed here were not distributed normally. These considerations led to the use of IQR value to derive CS in this study. Finally, had we used 2SD or 3SD instead of IQR to develop the CS, none of the 25 T&#x002B;B- results would change.</p>
<p>In our study, we used the same CS for classifying FCXM irrespective of whether the cells were from a living donor or a deceased donor and regardless of whether the cells were isolated from peripheral blood, spleen or lymph node. The use of same CS irrespective of the donor cell type may be of concern since Badders et al. found that HLA-class I expression is lower on B cells isolated from deceased donor blood compared to B cells isolated from spleen, lymph node or B cells isolated from living donor blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The source of cells used as target cells in our study was not a significant issue since 22 of 25 T&#x002B;B- were performed using PBMC.</p>
<p>Autoantibodies directed at T cells could result in a T&#x002B;B- result. In our analysis of 1475 recipient auto FCXM performed in our laboratory during 2014 to 2018 (the same vintage as the 25 T&#x002B;B- results reported here), not even a single auto FCXM was T&#x002B;B- (0&#x0025;) and 5 were T&#x002B;B&#x002B; (0.34&#x0025;), 119 were T-B&#x002B; (8.17&#x0025;), and 1333 of 1475 were T-B-(91.49&#x0025;). Thus, a T cell autoantibody being responsible for the observed T&#x002B;B- FCXM appears extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>There are limitations to our study. The donor cells used in our FCXM tests were not treated with pronase, and our results may not be generalizable to tests performed using pronase treated cells. Pronase treatment has been reported to &#x201C;improve flow cytometric detection of HLA antibodies&#x201D;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and &#x201C;improve flow cytometry crossmatch results&#x201D;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. However, pronase may also unmask cryptic epitopes on T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, elicit new reactivity to donor B cells and autologous B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, reduce HLA density on target cells leading to incorrect FCXM results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> including false positive T cell FCXM tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The donors in our study were not HLA typed at high resolution and therefore the detected antibody may not be donor HLA allele specific. The LSA assay deployed in this study may not have included donor specific allele. These two limitations however apply to the lack of association between the summed MFI of DSA and MCF but not to the T&#x002B;B- FCXM result since the B and T cells were from the same donor.</p>
<p>In sum, data analysis involving 3073 clinical FCXM tests performed using a standardized protocol in an ASHI accredited Histocompatibility laboratory identified that almost 10&#x0025; of FCXM tests that are T&#x002B; FCXM are T&#x002B;B- FCXM. We demonstrate that IgG antibodies directed at HLA-A, B and/or C locus determined antigens are associated with a T&#x002B;B- result. Differential expression of HLA on T cells and B cells and/or differential binding of antibodies to T cells and B cells and CS used to qualify a FCXM test as positive or negative are potential contributors to the surprising T&#x002B;B- FCXM result.</p>
