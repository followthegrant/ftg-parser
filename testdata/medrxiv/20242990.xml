<title>Summary</title>
<p>Polygenic risk scores (PRS) aim to quantify the contribution of multiple genetic loci to an individual&#x2019;s likelihood of a complex trait or disease. However, existing PRS estimate genetic liability using common genetic variants, excluding the impact of rare variants. We identified rare, large-effect variants in individuals with outlier gene expression from the GTEx project and then assessed their impact on PRS predictions in the UK Biobank (UKB). We observed large deviations from the PRS-predicted phenotypes for carriers of multiple outlier rare variants; for example, individuals classified as &#x201C;low-risk&#x201D; but in the top 1&#x0025; of outlier rare variant burden had a 6-fold higher rate of severe obesity. We replicated these findings using data from the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) biobank and the Million Veteran Program, and demonstrated that PRS across multiple traits will significantly benefit from the inclusion of rare genetic variants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A major goal of complex disease genetics is predicting an individual&#x2019;s disease risk. Recent efforts have aimed at summarizing genome-wide risk for multiple traits and diseases using polygenic risk scores (PRS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, which are derived by summing genome-wide common genetic variants associated with a given phenotype. PRS have demonstrated stratification of genetic disease risk, but there remains substantial unexplained variability in these predictions. One potential explanation for this variability is the presence of rare variants with large phenotypic effects that are unaccounted for in PRS models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>However, despite known contributions of rare genetic variants to complex traits and diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, rare variants are difficult to robustly characterize and integrate into PRS predictions due to their abundance in the genome, poor interpretability and sample size constraints. To in-part alleviate this challenge, it has previously been shown that individuals with outlier gene expression have an increased burden of rare variants proximal to the outlier gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and that this subset of rare variants tend to have larger effects on traits and diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Given the known large effects of rare variants linked to expression outliers - and that these variants are not currently included in existing PRS - we sought to test whether this subset of rare variants can aid in explaining instances where an individual&#x2019;s phenotype deviates from their phenotype as predicted by their PRS. We present an approach that summarizes the phenotypic effects in UKB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> of an increasing burden of rare variants associated with outlier gene expression discovered in GTEx. We focus primarily on body mass index (BMI) and obesity given the growing public health emergency of severe obesity in the US and around the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, the availability of high-quality publicly-available PRS for BMI, known polygenicity, and sample size considerations.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Identification of rare, large-effect expression variants</title>
<p>To identify rare variants linked to gene expression outliers that could also be tested for their effects on complex traits, we intersected the set of single nucleotide variants with gnomAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> minor allele frequency (MAF) &#x003E; 0 and &#x003C; 1&#x0025; identified in GTEx v7 with high-quality imputed variants in the UKB (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). From a starting set of 6,134,805 unique rare variants, we identified 1,307,023 (21.3&#x0025;) variants also within the UKB (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). From this intersecting set, we compared the set of variants found in GTEx outlier to non-outlier individuals to isolate the subset of rare variants present in gene expression outlier individuals only. This process was conducted in two ways; &#x201C;top-outlier&#x201D; where only rare variants from the most extreme outlier individual(s) (maximum of two individuals per gene - most under-expressed and most over-expressed individuals, abs(Z)&#x003E;2), and &#x201C;all outliers&#x201D; where all rare variants from individuals with abs(Z)&#x003E;2 were included (<bold>Methods; Sup. Table 1</bold>). Rare variants found in both outlier and non-outlier individuals were subsequently removed. Variants were then linked to a specific gene if they fell within the gene body or &#x002B;/- 10 Kb (N genes: &#x201C;top-outlier&#x201D; = 3,732; &#x201C;all-outliers&#x201D; = 15,095). We consider the &#x201C;top-outlier&#x201D; as a high-confidence set, given that these variants are found in the most extreme expression outliers. The &#x201C;all-outlier&#x201D; method allows us to expand the range of variants, guided by the properties of the &#x201C;top-outlier&#x201D; variant set. We further defined a corresponding set of non-outlier/control variants, matched on both the gnomAD MAF and CADD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> scores of outlier variants (<bold>Methods</bold>).</p>

<p><bold>A</bold>. Overview of methodology: rare variants (gnomAD MAF&#x003C;1&#x0025;) were identified in expression outlier samples across 48 GTEx tissues, discarding any variants also observed in non-outliers; variants from non-outlier samples were selected per gene, matched on gnomAD MAF (&#x003C;1&#x0025;) and CADD score (&#x002B;/- 5), to create a control set; variants were linked to UKB samples, combined with UKB samples&#x2019; BMI PRS, ancestry PCs, age, sex, and phenotype data. <bold>B</bold>. Number of rare GTEx variants recovered in UKB imputed set. <bold>C</bold>. Example gene locus (<italic>FOXO3</italic>) containing a common variant genome-wide significant hit for BMI illustrates large GWAS effect size of outlier-associated variants: (left) showing distribution of - log10(P-values) for UKB BMI GWAS for all outlier (blue halo) and non-outlier (gray halo) variants linked to the gene; (right) associated effect sizes, stratified by UKB allele count. Outlier variants have among the largest effects in gene locus but do not reach genome-wide significance.

<p>We observed that individuals were often carriers for multiple outlier rare variants. Considering a sample cohort of individuals from UKB (N = 120,944) (<bold>Methods; Sup. Fig. 1</bold>), each individual had an average of 23 (&#x201C;top-outlier&#x201D;) and 304 (&#x201C;all-outlier&#x201D;) outlier variants. To evaluate if these variants cumulatively were biased in effect direction (i.e. risk or protective) for a highly polygenic trait, we assessed UKB BMI GWAS effect directions and observed no significant differences. On average, individuals carried 11 potential protective rare variants and 12 potential risk variants using the &#x201C;top-outlier&#x201D; approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Large-effect, rare expression variants impact BMI and obesity in UK Biobank</title>
<p>To evaluate if rare expression outlier-associated variants had greater effect sizes than matched non-outlier variants (used as a control set), we focused on BMI and obesity GWAS from the UKB. We observed that a subset of outlier variants had relatively larger GWAS effects; for example, an outlier variant linked to the gene <italic>FOXO3</italic> has an effect size rank of 1/3059 in a 1 Mb locus (centered on the top genome-wide significant variant) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>), and among the top 0.07&#x0025; of effect sizes overall, across all variants measured across the UKB for BMI.</p>
<p>To systematically assess whether these outlier variants had higher effect sizes than non-outlier variants, we performed a permutation test (N permutations = 10,000) using outlier (&#x201C;top-outlier&#x201D;; n variants = 8,272) and matched non-outlier variants (n variants = 29,659) that fall within 10kb of any PRS variant to assess how often randomly-drawn outlier variants had larger effect sizes than non-outlier variants. For BMI GWAS, we observed a mean odds ratio of 1.02 when comparing outlier vs. non-outlier variants, and a mean odds ratio of 1 when comparing non-outlier variants to themselves (Wilcoxon test, <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup>). For obesity GWAS (ICD-10 E66), we observed an increased mean odds ratio of 1.1 (Wilcoxon test, <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup>) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). When increasing the outlier expression Z-score threshold, we observed progressively larger odds ratios (mean odds ratio (BMI GWAS): abs(Z)&#x003E;4 = 1.28; abs(Z)&#x003E;6 = 1.58), but not when comparing non-outlier variants only (mean odds ratio (BMI GWAS): abs(Z)&#x003E;4 = 1; abs(Z)&#x003E;6 = 1) (Wilcoxon test, <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup> for both comparisons) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). We replicated the permutation test findings using a subset of the same rare variants that are also available in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) BMI GWAS (N variants: outlier = 4,955; non-outlier = 18,145), and observed similar results (mean odds ratio: outlier vs. non-outlier = 1.05; non-outlier only = 1; <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup>) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). We further directly compared effect sizes between outlier and control variants and observed significantly increased effect sizes for outlier variants that increased with outlier Z-score thresholds (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>; Ansari test, <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup> for all comparisons).</p>

<p>We next assessed whether outlier variant effects were concordant with predictions of effect direction from common variant associations. We compared GWAS effect direction between cis-eQTLs and outlier variants for the same loci matched on slope (as an example, positive cis-eQTL slope and over-expression outliers both leading to increased GWAS risk) (<bold>Methods</bold>). We stratified results by cis-eQTL variant GWAS p-value and outlier-associated variant Z-score, observing that variants identified in more-severe (by Z-score) expression outliers have overall better concordance in GWAS effect direction with cis-eQTL variants, across genes. For example, at a cis-eQTL variant GWAS P-value cutoff &#x003C;= 1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>, we observed 50, 96, and 100&#x0025; concordance for variants passing absolute Z-score thresholds of 2, 3, and 4, respectively (<bold>Sup.

<title>Independent outlier gene count (IOGC) score stratifies BMI</title>
<p>To identify the impact of multiple outlier variants in an existing high-quality, publicly-available BMI PRS, we used data from Khera et al. (2019)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. We first obtained gnomAD AF for PRS variants, and observed that these PRS alleles have a mean gnomAD AF = 0.49 (SD = 0.29) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). Plotting GWAS effect sizes by UKB allele count for an example locus (gene <italic>FOXO3</italic>) further illustrates that PRS variants tend to be common variants with small effects (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold>). We calculated PRS for each individual in our UKB validation cohort (N = 120,944) and observed the expected gradients in mean BMI and weight increasing by PRS deciles (<bold>Sup. Fig. 3</bold>). We then used a linear regression model to assess change in BMI given an individual&#x2019;s PRS, sex, age, first ten components of genetic ancestry, genotyping array, and a score that quantifies the total outlier-variant burden per individual, computed by subtracting total protective from total risk outlier-variants collapsed to gene-level (<bold>Methods; Sup. Fig. 4</bold>). We refer to this score as the independent outlier gene count (IOGC) score henceforth. We observed significant coefficient estimates for 10/15 features in the model, including IOGC score (linear regression <italic>r</italic> = 0.015, <italic>P</italic> = 7&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>) (<bold>Sup. Fig. 5</bold>). We computed the rate of concordance in GWAS effect (i.e. risk/protective) and outlier direction for outlier variants linked genes across UKB individuals, observing a rate of concordance of 86.7&#x0025; for individuals with &#x003E;=2 outlier variants linked to each gene. This rate of concordance is remarkably stable when increasing the outlier variant threshold per gene (82.2&#x0025;, 81.8&#x0025;, 83.2&#x0025;, for &#x003E;= 3, 4, and 5 outlier variants, respectively).</p>
<p>We sought to clarify whether IOGC variants identified from outlier individuals in GTEx were driving downstream effects on BMI in excess of what is observed by selecting random subsets of non-outlier rare variants. We investigated this by first selecting random subsets of the matched non-outlier variants (matching the number of outlier variants across permutations, N variants = 8,272; N permutations = 10,000), observing that the IOGC beta estimate when using outlier variants exceeds that which would be expected based on random subsets of non-outlier variants (mean IOGC non-outlier = 0.0075; empirical <italic>P</italic> = 0.0012) (<bold>Sup. Fig. 6A</bold>), validating the findings of the permutation test described in the previous section. Furthermore, when outliers where observed across more than one tissue, we observed a mean change in BMI of 0.015 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> per unit change in IOGC score (linear regression, <italic>P</italic> = 7&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>), whereas increasing this threshold to &#x003E;= 10 tissues results in a greater than 5-fold increase in mean change in BMI to 0.08 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> per unit change in IOGC score (linear regression, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref></bold>). Using a permutation test of matched non-outlier variants (N permutations = 10,000), we again observed that outlier effects exceed that which would be expected using random subsets of rare variants (<bold>Sup. Fig. 6B</bold>).</p>
<p>We further investigated whether the severity of outlier gene expression integrated into the IOGC score affected change in BMI. We observed that at increasingly more-stringent Z-score thresholds, mean change in BMI also increased (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref></bold>) (abs(Z) 2-3, linear regression <italic>r</italic> = 0.008 (<italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>); abs(Z) 3-4, linear regression <italic>r</italic> = 0.009 (<italic>P</italic> = 2&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>); abs(Z) 4-5, linear regression <italic>r</italic> = 0.014 (<italic>P</italic> = 9&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup>). Comparing variants identified in outlier genes with Z-score between abs(Z) 2-3 with abs(Z) 4-5, we observe a 75&#x0025; increase in mean change in BMI per unit change in IOGC score.</p>

<title>Extreme IOGC scores lead to substantial deviation from PRS for BMI and obesity</title>
<p>From the analyses presented above, rare variants linked to outlier gene expression in GTEx had larger effects on BMI and rates of obesity, independent of PRS, and this effect is modulated by properties of outlier effects (i.e. multi-tissue outliers, outlier Z-score severity). We next sought to understand the magnitude of deviation from cohort-average BMI and obesity associated with outlier rare variant burden. For this analysis we used outlier-associated variants identified using the all-outlier method (<bold>Methods</bold>) - this increases the range of IOGC scores we can interrogate (range: top-outlier = &#x2212;19:20; all-outliers = &#x2212;67:69).</p>
<p>We calculated the mean rate of change in BMI across different percentiles of IOGC score using a linear regression model, adjusting for PRS, age, sex, first ten principal components of ancestry, and genotyping array. Each increment in IOGC score percentile bin is associated with a mean rate of change in BMI of 0.05 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> (linear regression, <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup>); comparing bottom and top 0.05&#x0025; percentiles, this results in a difference in mean BMI of 0.74 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). In the regression model, we tested for an interaction between PRS and IOGC score and observed no significant effect.</p>

We also tested for risk of being underweight (BMI&#x003C;18.5 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) and found an inverse relationship (i.e. lower IOGC score percentile increases risk of being underweight) (logistic regression, <italic>P</italic> = 0.003).</p>
<p>Individuals in extreme IOGC score percentiles further differed in their age of onset of obesity and high blood pressure diagnosis (where high blood pressure is used as a proxy for hypertension). For diagnosis of obesity, individuals in IOGC score percentile &#x003C;=1&#x0025;, mean age of onset obesity = 59.41, whereas individuals in IOGC score percentile &#x003E;=99&#x0025;, mean age of onset = 56.95, a difference of in age of onset of 2.46 years (Wilcoxon test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). For high blood pressure diagnosis, individuals in IOGC score percentile &#x003C;=1&#x0025;, mean age of onset = 53.04, whereas individuals in IOGC score percentile &#x003E;=99&#x0025;, mean age of onset = 50.44, a difference of 2.6 years (Wilcoxon test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.004) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We also observed that effects of outlier rare variants can manifest from childhood. We identified a subset of individuals in the UKB validation cohort (N=55,126) who provided self-reported information on being &#x201C;plumper&#x201D; or &#x201C;thinner&#x201D; than average at age 10 (UKB data field #1687). We tested the association of IOGC score with childhood body size using a logistic regression model (where the response was coded as 0=&#x201C;thinner&#x201D;, 1=&#x201C;plumper&#x201D;). The model was adjusted for PRS, age, sex, and first ten principal components of ancestry. For each unit change in IOGC score, we observed an increase in the odds of having a &#x201C;plumper&#x201D; comparative body size at 10 of 1.001 (logistic regression, <italic>P</italic> = 3&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;09</sup>).</p>
<p>We next sought to understand the potential magnitude of deviation in PRS-predicted rate of severe obesity (BMI &#x003E;= 40 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) associated with extreme IOGC score. We first stratified individuals by PRS: &#x201C;low-risk&#x201D; (PRS decile 1); &#x201C;high-risk&#x201D; (PRS decile 10), and further subset by increasingly stringent percentiles of IOGC score (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). We computed empirical P-values using a permutation test (N permutations = 10,000) to understand how likely the rates of severe obesity are observed across random subsets of individuals from within the same PRS groups. From this analysis we observed, for example, that &#x201C;low-risk&#x201D; individuals (PRS decile 1) in the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of IOGC score have a rate of severe obesity approaching the average rate for PRS decile 10 (4.55&#x0025;, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0009), a greater than 6-fold increase in the PRS-predicted rate of severe obesity.</p>

<p>We performed regression modelling within the &#x201C;low-risk&#x201D; and &#x201C;high-risk&#x201D; PRS groups described above, and observed similar linear regression coefficients per change in IOGC score percentile bin (linear regression; PRS bin 1: <italic>r</italic> = 0.06 (<italic>P</italic> = 3&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>); PRS bin 10: <italic>r</italic> = 0.11 (<italic>P</italic> = 7&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>). We next investigated the composition of outlier variants among individuals with outlier IOGC scores (specifically, bottom and top 10&#x0025; of IOGC score distribution). For each individual in this set, we calculated the IOGC-aware deviation (i.e. below mean for low IOGC individuals, and above mean for high IOGC individuals) from within-group PRS mean BMI (as Z-score) and looked for differences in the relative composition of outlier variants in individuals near the mean (abs(Z-score)&#x003E;0 and &#x003C;0.5) and far from mean (abs(Z-score)&#x003E;=3). We observed that individuals far from their predicted PRS mean were enriched for missense and splicing outlier variants (Fisher&#x2019;s Exact Test; missense: odds ratio = 1.27 (CI 1.14 &#x2013; 1.40), <italic>P</italic> = 8&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>; splicing: odds ratio = 1.25 (CI 0.98 &#x2013; 1.58), <italic>P</italic> = 0.05) (<bold>Sup. Fig. 7</bold>). This finding suggests that variant annotations could be integrated in to future iterations of IOGC to further increase the predictive power of the score. Furthermore, we computed IOGC scores across genes summarized by their effect in the PRS (using the maximum effect weight per PRS variant mapped to within each gene), observing that IOGC score increases as a function of gene PRS effect size (<bold>Sup. Fig. 8</bold>). This results demonstrates that IOGC score is increased in genes with known larger effects on BMI.</p>

<title>Replication in TOPMed WHI</title>
<p>We replicated our findings using TOPMed WHI data, subset to individuals with European ancestry and with genetic and phenotypic data available (N = 6,501). We constructed a linear regression model including PRS, first ten principal components of ancestry, age, and IOGC score (sex is not included since TOPMed WHI is an all-female cohort). Variant effect directions were obtained from UKB GWAS, as above. IOGC score is again a significant predictor of BMI (mean change in BMI per quantile of IOGC score: linear regression <italic>r</italic> = 0.13 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>). Although explicitly tested in the regression model, we visually compared the PRS of individuals in the 10th and 90th percentile of IOGC score and observed no significant differences in PRS for these two groups (<bold>Sup. Fig. 9</bold>). In the regression model, we again tested for an interaction between PRS and IOGC score and observed no significant effect.</p>
<p>Similar to observations in UKB, rates of obesity (BMI &#x003E;= 30 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) and severe obesity (BMI &#x003E;= 40 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) for individuals in the 10<sup>th</sup> and 90<sup>th</sup> percentiles for IOGC score deviated from the average rates of the full cohort overall: obesity: 10<sup>th</sup> percentile = 31.03&#x0025;; 90<sup>th</sup> percentile = 35.30&#x0025;; average overall: 33.49&#x0025; (<bold>Sup.

<p>Subsetting by multi-tissue outlier-associated variants (N tissues &#x003E;= 10), we again observed a significant effect of IOGC score independent from PRS, age and genetic ancestry (mean change in BMI per quantile of IOGC score: linear regression <italic>r</italic> = 0.20 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01). Further highlighting the independence of IOGC score from PRS, risk of obesity and severe obesity among individuals within PRS decile 10 (&#x201C;high-risk&#x201D;) can vary substantially from average for individuals in the 10<sup>th</sup> and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of IOGC score (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To quantify differences in effect sizes of outlier-associated variants across diverse traits and disease, we repeated the same permutation test described earlier (<bold>Methods</bold>), utilizing all outlier- and non-outlier variants identified using the &#x201C;top-outlier&#x201D; method across 2,419 traits and diseases released in UKB Phase 1 GWAS (N permutations = 1,000). We observed a mean odds ratio of 1.05 (SD = 0.06) across all disease and traits when comparing outlier vs. non-outlier variants, and a mean odds ratio of 1 (SD = 0.002) for non-outlier variants only (Wilcoxon test, <italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 2&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup>) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>).

<p>Across different GWAS meta-categories (cancer, illnesses, physical traits, cause of death), we observed the same overall trend for observing outlier variants with top GWAS effect sizes, increasing with Z-score threshold (<italic>P</italic> &#x003C; 2&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup> for all outlier vs. non-outlier comparisons) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref></bold>).

We also expected some GWAS traits to not be sensitive to SNPs linked to gene outlier effects. We explored this hypothesis by manually selecting several traits where genetic relationships are more speculative (i.e. loud music exposure, transport for commuting to job) and observed no difference in the distribution of odds ratios comparing outlier vs. non-outlier variants and non-outlier variants only (<bold>Sup.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Integration of rare variants within polygenic risk predictions is a major challenge. We have demonstrated that a high burden of rare variants can lead to substantial deviations in PRS-predicted phenotype. Furthermore, by integrating rare variants into genetic risk prediction using the IOGC score, we demonstrate improvements in predicting risk for multiple traits and diseases. Specifically, for BMI we demonstrate that PRS &#x201C;low-risk&#x201D; individuals who are in the top 1&#x0025; of IOGC have a rate of severe obesity (BMI&#x003E;=40 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) approaching the average rate for PRS &#x201C;high-risk&#x201D; individuals. By leveraging diverse traits and diseases recorded in the UKB we further demonstrate applications for diverse polygenic phenotypes.</p>
<p>Notably, the power of this approach is enabled by first isolating rare, expression outlier-linked variants in GTEx. Given that this cohort is limited to 546 individuals, it is certain that many large-effect variants impacting expression remain to be identified. Future large-scale RNA-sequencing studies and catalogues of outlier-associated rare variants will only increase the efficacy of this approach. Furthermore, we could recover only a subset of outlier-associated rare variants in UKB, due to limitations in imputation; future WGS in population biobanks will recover more rare, outlier-associated variants. Future WGS will also expand the frequency spectra that can be interrogated - carriers of ultra-rare, outlier variants are likely to have even larger effects and impacts on the IOGC score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, future work could integrate other data modalities (e.g. single cell, proteomics outliers).</p>
<p>Our study offers a baseline of phenotypic effects of rare, large-effect variants and shows considerable impact in aiding the prediction of individual phenotypes. As with current genetic risk prediction, we expect that the IOGC score can immediately help to better identify and stratify high-risk individuals into specific early treatments. Overall, this work has important immediate implications for the implementation of genetic risk prediction in standard clinical care.</p>

Using the software bedtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> (--window flag), variants were linked to genes if falling within the gene body, 10 Kb upstream of transcription start start, or 10 Kb downstream of the transcription end site. Using the software Vcfanno<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, SNP variants were intersected with gnomAD (version r2.0.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and CADD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> databases to obtain the minor allele frequency and CADD score, respectively, for each variant. Variant annotations were obtained using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) (version 88)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Minor allele frequencies were calculated across all individuals in gnomAD. Non-SNP (i.e. indel, SNV) variants were discarded. SNPs were retained if the gnomAD MAF fell in the range 0&#x003C;MAF&#x003C;1&#x0025;. Multi-allelic SNPs were removed (multi-allelic in gnomAD). Finally, SNPs were required to have been directly measured or imputed in UKB Phase 1 GWAS (imputation quality as described in [<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>], namely: UKB MAF &#x003E; 0.1&#x0025;; Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium P &#x003E; 1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup>; INFO score &#x003E; 0.8).</p>
<p>Processed RNA-sequencing data was obtained from GTEx v7 (see <bold>Resource Availability</bold>). To identify GTEx outlier gene expression samples, normalized gene expression values (FPKM) were processed across all GTEx v7 tissues, limited to autosomal genes annotated as protein coding or long non-coding RNA genes in GENCODE v19. A minimum expression filter was applied per gene (&#x003E;=10 individuals with FPKM &#x003E; 0.1 and read count &#x003E; 6); genes not passing this filter were removed. Expression values were PEER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> factor corrected (using 15 factors for tissues with &#x003C;= 150 samples, 30 for tissues with &#x003C;= 250 samples, and 35 for tissues with &#x003E; 250 samples), then scaled and centered to generate expression Z-scores. Individuals exhibiting global patterns of outlier gene expression for a given tissue were removed from the final corrected expression matrix for that tissue. Global outlier is defined as any individual who has the most-extreme absolute Z-score of corrected gene expression in 100 or more genes in a given tissue at an outlier cutoff of abs(Z-score)&#x003E;2.</p>

<p>UKB Phase 1 GWAS summary statistics were downloaded from the Neale Lab server (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank">http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank</ext-link>). Summary statistics for each GTEx outlier and non-outlier variant were joined on chromosome, position, ref, and alt columns, using hg19 coordinates. All other phenotypic and genotypic data were sourced from the data instance approved under UKB application #24983 (see <bold>Resource Availability</bold>). Individual-level phenotypes for weight (UKB data field #21002), body mass index (UKB data field #21001) and diabetes (UKB data field #2443) were downloaded from the relevant phenotype file. For weight and BMI, we averaged (using the median) over all observations per-individual for those individuals with multiple observations for the same phenotype. Imputed and directly measured genotypes for all variants used in this study were extracted from the genotyping callset (version 3). Additional phenotypic and demographic data used included: age, sex, principal components, genotyping array (all included in the UKB sample QC file); age of onset of diagnosis (obesity (UKB data field #130792), high blood pressure (UKB data field #2966), diabetes (UKB data field #2976)); and comparative body size at age 10 (UKB data field #1687).</p>

BED files were created using the software plink (version 2.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.

<p>Genotype principal components we computed using a random selection of common variants (N=50,000) available in UKB; we chose to leverage UK Biobank allele count information to define a set of high-confidence common variants (UKB minor allele count &#x003E; 50,000), given the increased sample size of UKB compared with TOPMed WHI. Genotypes were extracted using plink (version 2.0). To create the input matrix for computed principal components, the genotypes of each extracted variant was imported and checked for minor allele variants and the percentage of missing genotypes; alles with zero minor allele variants and/or &#x003E;1&#x0025; missingness were removed. For variants with &#x003E;0 and &#x003C;=1&#x0025; genotype missingness, missing genotypes were replaced by the mode for that particular variant.

<title>Million Veteran Program (MVP) GWAS for body mass index</title>
<p>DNA extracted from participants&#x2019; blood was genotyped using a customized Affymetrix Axiom&#x00AE; biobank array, the MVP 1.0 Genotyping Array. The array was enriched for both common and rare genetic variants of clinical significance in different ethnic backgrounds. Quality-control procedures used to assign ancestry, remove low-quality samples and variants, and perform genotype imputation to the 1000 Genomes reference panel were previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Individuals related more than second degree cousins were excluded.</p>
<p>We recently conducted HARE (Harmonized ancestry and Race/Ethnicity) analysis using race/ethnicity information from MVP participants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Genotyped MVP participants are assigned into one of the four HARE groups (Hispanics, non-Hispanics White, non-Hispanics Black, and non-Hispanics Asian) and &#x201C;Other&#x201D;. The analysis is based on a machine learning algorithm, which integrates race/ethnicity information from MVP baseline survey and high-density genetic variation data. Trans-ethnic, and ethnicity-specific principal component analyses were performed using flashPCA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. BMI was calculated as average BMI using all measurements within a three-year window around the date of MVP enrollment (i.e., 1.5 years before/after the date of enrollment), excluding height measurements that were &#x003E;3 inches or weight measurements &#x003E;60 pounds from the average of each participant.</p>
<p>Genetic association with BMI in the MVP cohort was examined among 217,980 non-Hispanic White participants. BMI was stratified by sex and adjusted for age, age-squared, and the top ten genotype-derived principal components in a linear regression model. The resulting residuals were transformed to approximate normality using inverse normal scores. Imputed and directly measured genetic variants were tested for association with the inverse normal transformed residuals of BMI through linear regression assuming an additive genetic model.</p>

<title>Isolating rare variants observed in GTEx gene expression outliers and non-outliers</title>
<p>Rare variants occurring in gene expression outlier individuals are identified using two methods; namely, top-outlier and all-outliers. Both approaches start with genetic and transcriptomic data processed as detailed above (&#x201C;GTEx v7 genetic and transcriptomic data&#x201D;). Using the top-outlier approach, variants were aggregated across all individuals and subset to gnomAD MAF &#x003E; 0 and &#x003C; 1&#x0025;. This list was then tabulated to obtain a count of unique individuals with each variant; any variant observed in &#x003E; 1 individual was removed. As a further filtering step, variants were retained only if they were included in UKB Phase 1 GWAS. To link variants to expression outliers, we identified for each tissue the individuals with the least or most expression per gene (i.e. under-expression outlier and over-expression outlier), removing any results falling below a predefined Z-score threshold of abs(Z-score) &#x003C; 2. We also defined, for each tissue and gene, a set of individuals with non-outlier gene expression (defined as abs(Z-score)&#x003C;1). Non-outlier variants were filtered to match the CADD score (within a window &#x002B;/- 5) of any outlier variants for each tissue/gene/outlier direction triple; this is important for genes with both an under-expression and over-expression outlier, as subsequent permutation testing uses outlier and non-outlier variants matched on a CADD score window. Variants identified in outliers in &#x003E;=1 tissue were ignored when identifying matching non-outlier variants; in this way, a putatively causal large-effect expression variant (in any number of tissues) would not be counted in both outlier and non-outlier variant sets. For the all-outliers method, we removed any outlier variant also identified in &#x003E;= 1 non-outlier individual; this differs from the top-outlier method, in which outlier variants identified in any other individual (regardless of outlier status) are removed. We did not define a matching set of non-outlier variants in the all-outliers method, due to run-time constraints on the computational pipeline developed for this study. For both methods, we recorded the number of tissues in which each outlier variant was identified (for variants identified in &#x003E;1 tissue, we refer to these as multi-tissue outlier variants).</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>GWAS effect size permutation test</title>
<p>We performed a permutation test to study differences in GWAS effect sizes for GTEx outlier and non-outlier variants. This test was repeated for two independent GWAS cohorts: UK Biobank and Million Veteran Program. For each GWAS, the input data is a file containing outlier and non-outlier variants with associated GWAS effect size (i.e. beta estimate), linked outlier gene, GTEx sample ID, outlier direction (under-expression/over-expression), and outlier tissue. Additionally, for GWAS of traits and disease where we also run a separate test after integrating PRS information, subsetting genes to those linked to any outlier variant falling within 10 Kb of a PRS variant. To define a set of outlier and non-outlier variants, we first subset outlier variants using a defined absolute Z-score of outlier gene expression, then find the intersection (using tissue, gene, and outlier direction) between the outlier variants that pass the Z-score thresholds and the matched non-outlier controls. This step ensures we have sufficient data to randomly select exactly one outlier and non-outlier variant per tissue/gene/outlier direction triple (we refer to this as an outlier triple), per permutation. The permutation test is based on the results of the top-outlier methods (see previous section); therefore, there is exactly one outlier individual per outlier triple. However, for non-outlier variants, there can be matched variants identified in &#x003E; 1 unique individual. We subset randomly to one non-outlier individual per outlier triple, then randomly select exactly one outlier and non-outlier variant per outlier triple. For each outlier triple, we then count which variant is associated with the greater GWAS absolute effect size (outlier/non-outlier); this information can then be summarized in a contingency table, which is then used as the input to compute an odds ratio. We repeated this analysis for a file containing non-outlier variants only, which follows the same method described above, comparing two randomly chosen non-outlier variants per outlier triple, for outlier triples with non-outlier variants from &#x003E;= 2 unique non-outlier individuals.</p>

<title>Calculating polygenic risk scores</title>
<p>We computed polygenic risk scores (PRS) for the UKB and TOPMed WHI cohorts in this study. Two high-quality, publicly-available PRS were used (see <bold>Resource Availability</bold>): body mass index (Khera.et.al_GPS_BMI_Cell_2019.txt.zip); and type-2 diabetes (Type2Diabetes_PRS_LDpred_rho0.01_v3.txt). Scores were calculated using the software plink (version 2.0) (--score flag). PRS variant coordinates were first converted to hg38 assembly using CrossMap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> for calculating PRS scores in the TOPMed WHI cohort. Scores were calculated separately for each chromosome, then summed per individual and scaled to generate Z-scores.</p>

<title>GTEx eQTL to assess concordance in GWAS effect direction between eQTL and outlier variants</title>
<p>GTEx eQTL summary statistics were downloaded and filtered on P-value (using column &#x201C;pval_nominal&#x201D;) with threshold P&#x003C;1&#x00D7;10<sup>&#x2212;18</sup>. Remaining variants were linked to their GWAS effect size (i.e. protective or risk). For genes with &#x003E;1 eQTL passing the P-value threshold, the variant with the smallest UKB GWAS P-value was retained. This step was computed separately for each GTEx tissue. We used a majority-rule approach to assign a single, high-quality consensus GWAS effect direction per gene, based on the median slope estimate and GWAS effect direction across all top eQTL variants per tissue that passed the two P-value filtering steps. For example, if a given gene consisted of 10 eQTL risk variants and 5 protective risk variants, the gene would be assigned a &#x201C;risk&#x201D; label. We removed any genes where a majority GWAS effect direction could not be computed (i.e. an equal number of protective and risk effects), genes where eQTL risk variants shared a median slope that matched the median slope of eQTL protective variants (e.g. positive slope in both cases), and genes where the slope of any eQTL risk variant matches the slope of any eQTL protective variant. Outlier variants are then compared on the slope and GWAS effect direction of the consensus eQTL results (e.g. for a given gene with positive median slope and GWAS risk effect, we assessed if the outlier variant was an over-expression outlier variant and its comparable relationship to GWAS risk).</p>

<title>Inferring UKB non-British white validation cohort</title>
<p>Using the self-identified non-British white labels that were reported in the UKB metadata, a larger cohort of predicted non-British white individuals was inferred. For all self-reported non-British white individuals, the mean and standard deviation of the first and second genotypic principal components were calculated. All individuals without a self-reported ethnic identity that were within &#x002B;/- 3 SD of the calculated mean PC1 and PC2 values were inferred to be non-British white. All self-reported non-British white individuals that fell out of this range were also excluded. This final cohort consisted of 23,790 self-reported non-British individuals, and 97,154 inferred non-British white individuals. We found that the PRS distribution of this non-British white cohort did not differ significantly from a normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk normality test; <italic>P</italic> = 0.2774), suggesting that the PRS as calculated on the British white cohort generalizes well to this cohort.</p>

<title>Quantifying effect on phenotypes associated with IOGC score</title>
<p>Using the list of GTEx outlier variants linked to genes, we retained the genes in which &#x003E;= 1 outlier variant overlapped any PRS variants (within a &#x002B;/- 10 Kb window). In this way, we focus only on genes previously linked to the phenotype (and therefore included in the PRS). The resulting set of outlier- and non-outlier variants in retained genes were written to a lookup file which was then input to the software plink<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (--extract flag) to identify UKB individuals in the validation cohort who are heterozygous or homozygous for each variant (i.e. alternate allele genotype 1 and 2, respectively). We then used previously-released UKB GWAS effect estimates to assign effect directions to each outlier variant (i.e. risk/protective). Given that the previously-released GWAS were calculated on UKB individuals with white British genetic ancestry (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>), the non-British white cohort validation cohort we constructed for this study, as well as the TOPMed WHI cohort, was non-overlapping.</p>
<p>We quantified the effect of outlier variant burden on phenotype by computing a score that summarizes, per individual, putative outlier gene burden. We refer to this quantity as the independent outlier gene count (IOGC). To compute this score, for each individual we link variants to effect size direction in UKB, then collapse to gene-level to prevent double-counting. Per individual, we convert the beta effect estimate per variant to integers using a sign function:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="20242990v1_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
, where <italic>&#x03B2;</italic> is the UKB GWAS beta coefficient for variant <italic>k</italic>. In practice, effect sizes of zero are not generally observed, so we expect to see only values of &#x2212;1 or 1. Following this step, we take the distinct values per gene (i.e. remove duplicates); since our goal is to use outlier variants to tag outlier/dysregulated gene expression, this step prevents counting of putative outlier gene expression more than once. Therefore, if we denote the vector of <italic>sgn</italic> (<italic>&#x03B2;</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) for variants linked to a given gene as <italic>s</italic>, then:
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="20242990v1_ueqn2.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>This is repeated across all genes <italic>g</italic> linked to &#x003E;=1 outlier variant, and summed to yield the IOGC score for each individual <italic>j</italic>:
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="20242990v1_ueqn3.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Linear regression was used for quantitative phenotypes, and logistic regression for binary phenotypes. In the regression models, we adjusted for PRS, age, sex (UKB only since TOPMed WHI is a female-only cohort), first ten principal components of genetic ancestry, and genotyping array (UKB only).</p>
