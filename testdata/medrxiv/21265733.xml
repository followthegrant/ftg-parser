<title>MAIN</title>
<p>There is abundant evidence supporting the view that rare genetic diseases are caused by rare, high-impact variants in individual genes. However, for virtually all known rare disorders, it is not possible to identify such pathogenic changes in every affected individual, leaving significant diagnostic and knowledge gaps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> In recent years, the emergence of comprehensive rare disease and population-based resources that link genomic and phenotypic data (e.g. UK Biobank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>) has offered unprecedented opportunities for genetic discovery. Through integrative analysis of the associated datasets, we can now achieve line-of-sight for uncovering complex molecular explanations in people with rare disorders who have hitherto remained undiagnosable.</p>
<p>Albinism, a rare condition characterised by decreased ocular pigmentation and altered visual system organisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, had a pivotal role in the study of human genetics tracing back to the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> At least 20 genes are now known to be associated with this disorder and the current diagnostic yield of genetic testing in affected cohorts approaches 75&#x0025;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Most people with a molecular diagnosis of albinism carry biallelic variants in <italic>TYR</italic>, the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of melanin biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Building on recent work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, we sought to increase our understanding of the genetic complexity of this archetypal disorder.</p>
<p>A cohort of 1208 people with albinism underwent testing of &#x2264;19 albinism-related genes; these individuals were not known to be related and had predominantly European ancestries. A further 105 probands with albinism were identified in the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. A &#x201C;control&#x201D; cohort of 29,497 unrelated individuals that had no recorded diagnosis/features of albinism was also identified in this resource (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>, Supplementary Table 1, Methods).</p>

</fig>
<p>To gain insights into the contribution of common variants to the genetic architecture of albinism, we studied the impact of protein-coding changes that have minor allele frequency [MAF] &#x2265;1&#x0025; and are predicted by a computational algorithm to be functionally relevant (CADD score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> &#x2265;20). For <italic>TYR</italic>, two such variants were identified: c.575C&#x003E;A (p.Ser192Tyr) [rs1042602] and c.1205G&#x003E;A (p.Arg402Gln) [rs1126809]. Multiple associations have been recorded for these two changes including skin/hair pigmentation (for both variants), macular thickness (for c.575C&#x003E;A) and iris colour (for c.1205G&#x003E;A).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Furthermore, each of these changes has been shown to decrease TYR enzymatic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> Importantly, there is evidence suggesting that c.1205G&#x003E;A is acting as a hypomorphic variant and is causing a mild form of albinism when in compound heterozygous state with a complete loss-of-function <italic>TYR</italic> mutation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> However, the MAF of this variant in European populations is around 27&#x0025; and multiple unaffected homozygous individuals have been reported (including &#x003E;2,000 people in the control subset of the Genome Aggregation Database [gnomAD] v2.1.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To gain insights into the contribution of regulatory variants, we studied the impact of changes that alter <italic>TYR</italic> regulatory elements (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. the <italic>TYR</italic> promoter or ENCODE-listed enhancers)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and affect <italic>TYR</italic> gene expression (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. they are known <italic>TYR</italic> expression quantitative trait loci [<italic>eQTL</italic>]). One such variant was identified, c.-301C&#x003E;T [rs4547091], a fetal retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) selective eQTL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. This change is known to alter a binding site for the transcription factor <italic>OTX2</italic> in the <italic>TYR</italic> promoter, and the reference allele (c.-301C) has been shown to lead to a remarkable decrease in promoter activity <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Focusing on individual sequence alterations without consideration for variant interactions and/or patterns of linkage disequilibrium can lead to masking of complex underlying mechanisms. To overcome this pitfall, we avoided an independent analysis of each of the <italic>TYR</italic> c.-301C&#x003E;T, c.575C&#x003E;A and c.1205G&#x003E;A changes and instead studied the haplotype blocks that they form. Eight possible haplotypes [2<sup>3</sup>] and 36 possible haplotype pairs [2<sup>3-1</sup> x (2<sup>3</sup>&#x002B;1)] may be encountered. We focused only on the 8 haplotype pairs that include homozygous alleles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>) for two reasons: (1) in homozygous individuals, the underlying haplotypes can be unambiguously determined, even in cases where segregation/phasing data are unavailable; (2) in autosomal recessive disorders like <italic>TYR</italic>-associated albinism, phenotypic abnormalities are the result of the combined effect of two alleles; by analyzing only homozygous cases, the effect of a specific haplotype can be isolated and estimated with greater precision.</p>

<p>We used Firth regression analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> to study how <italic>TYR</italic> haplotypes in homozygous state affect the risk of albinism. This increasingly recognised logistic regression approach has been designed to handle small, imbalanced datasets (which are common in studies of rare conditions) and allows for adjustment of key covariates (which is not possible in contingency table methods) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>, Methods). The results are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref> and Supplementary Table 2. This analysis identified a number of pertinent points that are discussed below.</p>
<p>We found that the penetrance of the hypomorphic <italic>TYR</italic> c.1205G&#x003E;A variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> is modulated by the <italic>TYR</italic> c.-301C&#x003E;T promoter change. When c.1205G&#x003E;A is encountered in a homozygous state and in combination with the c.-301C allele of the promoter variant (which reduces <italic>TYR</italic> expression), the risk of albinism is high (OR&#x003E;19; see [C;A;A] and [C;C;A] in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). In contrast, homozygosity for c.1205G&#x003E;A combined with the c.-301T allele (which increases <italic>TYR</italic> expression) has a protective effect (OR&#x003C;0.6; see [T;C;A] in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). This observation is in keeping with previous studies suggesting that penetrance can be modified by the joint functional effects of regulatory and protein-coding variants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> We here provide a key illustration of this mechanism in the context of a recessively-acting hypomorphic variant.</p>
<p>Alongside this, we found that homozygosity for the <italic>TYR</italic> c.-301C&#x003E;T promoter variant protects against albinism (OR 0.2-0.7; see [T;C;A] and [T;C;G] in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). Notably, the allele frequency of the protective c.-301T allele, approaches 80&#x0025; in people of African ancestries and is around 40&#x0025; in people of European ancestries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (see Supplementary Fig.1 for the geographical distribution of the associated variants/haplotypes). It can be speculated that variation in this <italic>TYR</italic> promoter position partly accounts for the relatively low prevalence of <italic>TYR</italic>-associated albinism in people of African ancestries (Supplementary Table 3).</p>
<p>Our findings also highlight that homozygosity for the haplotype formed by the c.-301C allele of the promoter variant (which reduces <italic>TYR</italic> expression) and the non-reference alleles of the two common missense changes, c.575C&#x003E;A and c.1205G&#x003E;A, is associated with a significant increase in the risk of albinism (OR &#x003E;77; see [C;A;A] in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). This haplotype is present in &#x223C;1&#x0025; of people with European ancestries in the 1000 Genomes Project (phase 3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and the associated risk of albinism is comparable to that of a loss-of-function Mendelian mutation.</p>
<p>When the <italic>TYR</italic> c.[-301C;575A;1205A] and c.[-301C;575C;1205A] haplotypes (corresponding to [C;A;A] and [C;C;A] in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>) were factored in as Mendelian variants in a clinical-grade analysis of the case cohort, the diagnostic yield increased from 57&#x0025; (693/1208) to 76&#x0025; (920/1208). Current genetic laboratory pipelines are generally suboptimally set up to identify these complex high-risk haplotypes, especially when filtering is based on the rarity of individual variants.</p>
<p>We subsequently studied the impact of the <italic>TYR</italic> c.[-301C;575A;1205A] haplotype (corresponding to [C;A;A] in<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>) in UK Biobank participants. We found that people who were homozygous for this haplotype had, on average, reduced visual acuity (mean LogMAR vision 0.10; Kruskal-Wallis p-value 8 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;11</sup> with all pair-wise comparisons involving [C;A;A] being statistically significant; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref> and Supplementary Table 4). As visual acuity is a quantitative endophenotype of albinism, this finding provides additional evidence supporting the functional significance of this complex haplotype. A similar trend was noted when central retinal thickness, another albinism endophenotype, was assessed (Kruskal-Wallis p-value &#x003C; 2 &#x00D7; 10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup>; Supplementary Fig.2 and Supplementary Table 5). We expect that future studies of visual function and ocular structure in this group of homozygous individuals will provide key insights into the elusive link between RPE melanin synthesis and visual system organisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, we quantified the risk of albinism associated with combinations of rare and common variants. For each study participant, we estimated two key contributors to an individual&#x2019;s risk. First, we counted the number of rare, presumed Mendelian variants in albinism-associated genes; single nucleotide variants that have MAF&#x003C;1&#x0025; and are labelled as disease-causing (DM) in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) v2021.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> were considered. Subsequently, we counted the number of common &#x201C;risk genotypes&#x201D; in <italic>TYR</italic> (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. c.-301C, c.575A and/or c.1205A). We found that the presence of &#x003E;4 common <italic>TYR</italic> risk genotypes confers an increased risk of albinism even in the absence of a rare, HGMD-listed variant (OR&#x003E;4; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We also found that when a single heterozygous HGMD-listed variant co-occurs with &#x003E;1 common <italic>TYR</italic> risk genotype, the risk of albinism is increased (OR&#x003E;4 for rare variants in any albinism-related gene, OR&#x003E;6 for rare variants in <italic>TYR;</italic> <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These observations provide a basis for more precise genetic counseling in families with albinism.</p>

<caption><p>Contribution of different classes of albinism-associated variants to disease risk</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="21265733v1_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that a significant proportion of albinism risk arises from genetic susceptibility linked to common variants. Our findings also suggest that rare and common protein-coding variation in <italic>TYR</italic> should be considered in the context of regulatory haplotypes. The concepts discussed here are highly likely to be relevant to the understanding of other rare disorders, and haplotype-based approaches are expected to narrow the diagnostic gap for significant numbers of patients. Future work will embrace more diverse populations and focus on integrating both common and rare variants (including single-nucleotide and copy-number changes) into a single genetic risk score at scale.</p>

<title>University Hospital of Bordeaux albinism cohort</title>
<p>Individuals with albinism were identified through the database of the University Hospital of Bordeaux Molecular Genetics Laboratory, France. This is a national reference laboratory that has been performing genetic testing for albinism since 2003 and has been receiving samples from individuals predominantly based in France (or French-administered overseas territories). Information on the dermatological and ophthalmological phenotypes was available and all people included in the study had at least one of the key ocular features of albinism, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. nystagmus or absence of a foveal pit (prominent foveal hypoplasia). Only individuals who were not knowingly related were included.</p>
<p>Genotyping, bioinformatic analyses, and clinical interpretation were performed as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> Briefly, most participants had gene-panel testing of 19 genes associated with albinism (<italic>TYR, OCA2, TYRP1, SLC45A2, SLC24A5, C10ORF11, GPR143, HPS 1</italic> to 10, <italic>LYST, SLC38A8</italic>) using IonTorrent platforms. High-resolution array-CGH (comparative genomic hybridization) was also used to detect copy number variants in these 19 genes. All genetic changes of interest were confirmed with an alternative method (e.g. Sanger sequencing or quantitative PCR). Clinical interpretation of variants was performed using criteria consistent with the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) best practice guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Generally, variants with MAF &#x2265;1&#x0025; in large publicly available datasets (e.g. gnomAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>) were considered unlikely to be disease-causing. We note that the genetic findings in a subset of this cohort (70&#x0025;; 845/1208) have been partly reported in a previous publication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Due to the limited number of genes screened in this cohort, it was not possible to reliably assess genetic ancestry and to objectively assign individuals to ancestry groups. Attempting to mitigate this, we processed available data on self-identified ethnicity that were collected through questionnaires. Responses were inspected and stratification into five broad continental groups (European, African, Admixed American, East Asian, South Asian) was performed.</p>
<p>Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their parents in the case of minors. The study was approved by the relevant local ethics committee (Comit&#x00E9; de Protection des Personnes Sud-Ouest et Outre Mer III, Bordeaux, France) and all investigations were conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>

Only variants that passed all provided site quality control criteria were processed. In addition, we filtered out genotypes with: genotype score &#x003C;20; read depth &#x003C;10; allele balance &#x003C;0.2 and &#x003E;0.8 for heterozygotes; allele balance &#x003E;0.1 or &#x003C;0.9 for homozygotes (reference and alternate, respectively).

A case-control analysis of a binary trait (presence/absence of albinism) was conducted assuming a recessive model.

<title>Analysis of visual acuity and foveal thickness in UK Biobank participants</title>
<p>The effect of homozygosity for selected <italic>TYR</italic> haplotypes was studied in UK Biobank participants. UK Biobank is a biomedical resource containing in-depth genetic and health information from &#x003E;500,000 individuals from across the UK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. A subset of UK Biobank volunteers underwent enhanced phenotyping including visual acuity testing (131,985 individuals) and imaging of the central retina (84,748 individuals)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>; the latter was obtained using optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive imaging test that rapidly generates cross-sectional retinal scans at micrometre-resolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> Notably, only 24 UK Biobank participants are assigned a diagnosis of albinism (data field 41270; ICD-10 term &#x201C;Albinism&#x201D; [E70.3]) of which only 7 had visual acuity measurements and none had OCT imaging. Given that reduced visual acuity and increased central retinal thickness (due to underdevelopment of the fovea) are two key hallmark features of albinism we investigated the impact of <italic>TYR</italic> risk haplotypes on these quantitative endophenotypes.</p>
<p>First, genotyping array data were used to obtain genotypes for <italic>TYR</italic> c.575C&#x003E;A [rs1042602] and <italic>TYR</italic> c.1205G&#x003E;A [rs1126809] (data field 22418 including information from the Applied Biosystems UK Biobank Axiom Array containing 825,927 markers). In contrast to these two changes, the <italic>TYR</italic> c.-301C&#x003E;T [rs4547091] variant was not directly captured by the array. However, high-quality (&#x003E;99.9&#x0025;) imputation data on this promoter change were available (data field 22828).</p>
<p>Subsequently, we calculated the mean of the right and left LogMAR visual acuity for each UK Biobank volunteer (data fields 5201 and 5208, &#x201C;instance 0&#x201D; datasets). These visual acuity measurements were subsequently used to compare visual performance between groups of people with different homozygous haplotype combinations. As the obtained distributions deviated from normality (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref>), the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Pair-wise comparisons were performed and the p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (Supplementary Table 4).</p>
<p>To obtain central foveal thickness measurements from UK Biobank OCT images, we calculated the mean of the right and left central retinal thickness (defined as the average distance between the hyperreflective bands corresponding to the RPE and the internal limiting membrane (ILM), across the central 1 mm diameter circle of the ETDRS grid) for each UK Biobank volunteer).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> The obtained measurements were then subsequently used to compare central macular thickness between groups of UK Biobank volunteers with different homozygous <italic>TYR</italic> haplotype combinations. As some of the obtained distributions deviated from normality (Supplementary Fig.2), the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Pair-wise comparisons were performed and the p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (Supplementary Table 5).</p>
