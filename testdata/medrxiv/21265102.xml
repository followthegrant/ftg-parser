<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL) is a rare but aggressive masquerade syndrome, which would be easily confused with uveitis. The diagnostic gold standard remains the pathologic examination of ocular specimen with invasiveness and low sensitivity. To improve the safety and accuracy of VRL diagnosis, alternative techniques using intraocular fluid (IOF) samples are emerging. In this study, we aimed to test the diagnostic value of genetic mutation analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in IOF for VRL and exhibit the mutation profile for revealing the molecular characteristics of VRL. Twenty-three suspected VRL patients were selected as the training group, who had genetic mutation analysis using a panel containing 446 tumor-related genes. Another external cohort including 5 VRL patients and 5 uveitis patients was selected for further validation. In training group, all of VRL patients had obtained 23 (IQR 13.5, 36.0) cfDNA mutations in IOF (sensitivity 100&#x0025;), and 2 out of 6 uveitis patients had one and four mutations respectively (specificity 67&#x0025;). The latter were identified as clonal hematopoiesis mutations. In validation group, all of VRL patients were positive and all of uveitis patients were negative for mutation analysis (sensitivity and specificity 100&#x0025;). VRL patients from the two groups were characterized by the high mutation frequencies of PIM1 (21/22, 90.91&#x0025;), MYD88 (17/22, 77.27&#x0025;), CD79B (11/22, 50.00&#x0025;), ETV6 (11/22, 50.00&#x0025;) and IRF4 (11/22, 50.00&#x0025;), and 77.27&#x0025; were MCD subtype with PI3K-Akt signaling pathway alternation. In conclusion, it demonstrated a new mini-invasive and feasible method for VRL diagnosis using a panel of 466 tumor-related genes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL) is a rare intraocular malignant lymphoma affecting the vitreous and/or the retina that can occur as a primary lymphoma or as a secondary manifestation of a primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>)</sup>. The vast majority of cases are histopathologically classified as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)</sup>.</p>
<p>Clinically, VRL masquerades posterior and pan-uveitis, and is highly aggressive and associated with an elevated mortality rate. It is challenging to distinguish VRL from uveitis because both of them present vitreous opacity and yellow subretinal lesions<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>)</sup>. However, delaying diagnosis, and therefore the start of treatment, may have vision- and lifethreatening consequences. The gold standard for the definite diagnosis of VRL is commonly based on the clinical presentation along with histopathologic or cytologic examinations of the ocular specimen including retinal tissue biopsy and vitreous fluid (VF), which demonstrate the malignant B lymphocytes and characterize lymphocyte type by immunohistochemistry<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>)</sup>. However, the limited cellular yield, the cell lysis due to the fragile nature of lymphoma cells and lack of experience of cytopathologist contribute to the difficulty in cytologic diagnosis<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>)</sup>. Meanwhile, retinal tissue biopsies are even more invasive and trickier, owing to the inherent risks associated with retinal surgery<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)</sup>.</p>
<p>To improve the safety and accuracy of VRL diagnosis, the alternative techniques are emerging, for example the detection of IGH gene rearrangements of lymphoma cells by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the measurement of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine by flow cytometry using intraocular fluid (IOF) samples. However, the sensitivity and specificity of IGH gene rearrangements and IL-10/IL-6 ratio in different studies ranges from 60&#x0025; to 90&#x0025;, which are largely affected by the quality of sample, the choice of primers set and the treatment of corticosteroids<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>)</sup>. Ocular inflammatory conditions can also induce oligoclonal expansion of B lymphocytes and lead to false positive diagnosis, especially in cases with low yield of collected cells<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>)</sup>. Thus, a detection method using IOF samples with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of VRL needs to be explored.</p>
<p>The circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is the endogenous DNA secreted by or derived from cells which can be detected in the circulation of body fluids or blood. The circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) harbors the tumor-derived genetic alterations, having been recognized as a tumor-specific biomarker and showing encouraging results in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of multiple solid cancers <sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)</sup>. Recently, there is a growing interest in the genetic mutations of cfDNA in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for their potential utility in the diagnosis and management of CNS lymphoma patients<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>)</sup>. In 2018 Laura S.et al. reported that the anterior humor (AH)-based MYD88<sup>L265P</sup> mutation analysis would provide an additional liquid biopsy tool to diagnose and monitor patients with VRL<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>)</sup>. However, MYD88 mutation could only be found in about 70&#x0025; VRL patients<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>)</sup>, and more various mutations of lymphoma cells should be identified for better diagnosis. Currently many genomic sequencing studies have revealed that genetic mutations are associated with overall survival and differential response to chemotherapy in systemic DLBCL. However, few studies focus on the genetic mutations profile of VRL. Therefore, the genetic mutation profile of VRL remains to be established, which may be used to reveal molecular characteristics and guide molecular targeted therapy of VRL in future.</p>
<p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has emerged as a promising approach for cfDNA mutational profiling characterized with high-throughput, high sensitivity and specificity. Here, we used a panel of 446 hematopoietic tumor-related genes on NGS. In this study, the 446-gene panel was used to detect cfDNA mutations in IOF samples from a training group of diagnosed VRL and chronic uveitis patients, and validated in IOF samples from another group. The clinical records were analyzed retrospectively, aiming to explore the clinical utility of the NGS detection in IOF for VRL diagnosis.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Patients selection, samples collection, treatment and follow-up in the training group</title>
<p>Patients who were suspected as VRL and had cfDNA mutation analysis performed at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC) of the Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China, between April 1st 2018 and March 1st 2021, were selected as the training group. Written informed consent was collected from each patient and the study design was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University (NO.2021KYPJ190). All procedures were performed in compliance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.</p>
<p>These patients who presented the manifestations of severe vitreous opacity or diffuse subretinal yellow lesions or both were suspected as VRL by two experienced ophthalmologists (D. Liang and WR. Su) at the initial stage. Routine eye examination of slit lamp, fundus photography, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and B-ultrasound examination had been taken. To clarify the diagnosis the laboratory investigations for autoimmune disease or other etiology of uveitis including tests for syphilis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and antiviral antibodies; chest CT, urinalysis, kidney, and liver function were routinely checked. Some patients also had brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cytologic examination of CSF to exclude CNS lymphoma.</p>
<p>IL-10/IL-6 ratio, as well as cfDNA genetic mutation analysis of the IOF (either AH or VF, or both) samples were also tested in all patients to assist in diagnosis. IGH gene rearrangements were tested in a part of patients. The anterior chamber paracentesis was performed with a 31-gauge insulin syringe and the diagnostic vitrectomy was performed with a standard three-port approach<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>)</sup>. The undiluted samples were taken immediately to the cytopathologist, and prepared onto glass slides. One slide was stained with May-Gr&#x00FC;nwald-Giemsa, and the rest were used for the immunostainings<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)</sup>. No patient underwent retinal biopsies due to high risks of retinal and visual damage.</p>
<p>The therapeutic strategies of all patients were also determined by the two ophthalmologists (D Liang and WR Su). Patients presenting typically clinical features of VRL with the positive findings of histopathologic examination or IGH gene rearrangements, or IL-10/IL-6 ratio greater than 1 would be treated with vitreous injection of Methotrexate (MTX, 400 mg/0.1 ml). The oncologist (HQ. Huang) of cerebral lymphoma was invited to give systemic evaluation and treatment in need. With less evidence for VRL, patients were treated with local or systemic corticosteroids combined with/without immunosuppressive therapy or anti-infective treatments according to the patient&#x2019;s conditions and examinations. The therapeutic strategies were adjusted and the diagnoses were identified after careful evaluation of treatment effects in follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>The diagnostic criteria of VRL and uveitis</title>
<p>Combined ocular manifestations with the results of pathology, IL-10/IL-6 ratio, IGH gene rearrangements and patients&#x2019; response to treatments, patients were divided into three groups: definitive diagnosed VRL, clinically diagnosed VRL and chronic uveitis. The diagnosis was given by two experienced specialists (D Liang and WR Su) independently. Any disagreements on diagnosis and treatment were resolved by discussion and, if required, referred to a third specialist (XQ Chen).</p>
<p>The diagnostic criteria were as follows:</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Definitive diagnosis of VRL</title>
<p>It was established by pathological examinations of ocular specimens with/without the elevation of IL-10/IL-6 ratio or IGH gene rearrangements in IOF; or pathologic proven systemic lymphoma with ocular involvements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b2">
<title>Clinical diagnosis of VRL</title>
<p>Presenting clinical features suggestive for VRL but without positive finding in histopathology and cytomorphology, the patients show a positive response to MTX therapy during the follow-up, with/without the elevation of IL-10/IL-6 ratio or positive of IGH gene rearrangements in IOF.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b3">
<title>Diagnosis of uveitis</title>
<p>Even if characterized as clinical features of presumed VRL, the patients had no positive results of laboratory investigations including pathological examinations, IL-10/IL-6 ratio or IGH gene rearrangements to support the diagnosis of lymphoma, also show: positive laboratory investigations for autoimmune disease and positive responses to corticosteroids with/without immunosuppressive therapy; or positive laboratory investigations for infectious uveitis and positive responses to the anti-infective treatment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we classified the VRL lesions as previous reported<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>)</sup>: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) the vitreous opacity type, vitreous opacity of 2&#x002B; or higher without retinal lesions, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) the retina type, vitreous opacity of 1&#x002B; or less with retinal lesions only, or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) the concomitant type, with both.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>The diagnostic value of cfDNA genetic mutations analysis for VRL</title>
<p>The diagnostic value including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and test efficiency of genetic mutation analysis in diagnosing VRL were analyzed as previous described<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)</sup>. Patients in both the definitively and clinically diagnosed VRL were considered as patients with VRL for diagnosis value analysis. The detection of targeted genetic mutations was considered as positive and recorded as circulating tumor DNA, ctDNA (&#x002B;).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Verification of the diagnostic value of cfDNA mutations</title>
<p>Furthermore, a validation group of patients including definite diagnosis of VRL, clinical diagnosis of VRL and chronic uveitis with different etiology from the ophthalmic unite in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Beijing, China, was selected to validate the diagnostic value of cfDNA genetic mutation analysis in the diagnosis of VRL. The same diagnostic criteria as described above were used. The diagnosis was made by two experienced ophthalmologists (Yong.Tao and Zhuyun Qian) independently. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and, if required, referred to a third specialist. IOF samples from validation patients were sent for cfDNA mutation detection. All the patients signed an informed consent and institutional review board approval was obtained. The study was performed in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Mutation Analysis by NextGeneration Sequencing of cfDNA</title>
<sec id="s2e1">
<title>cfDNA extraction</title>
<p>Samples were collected and shipped to the central testing laboratory (Nanjing Geneseeq Technology Inc.) within 48 hours. cfDNA was extracted using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (QIAGEN). Genomic DNA of the whole blood sample was prepared by DNeasy Blood &#x0026; Tissue kit (QIAGEN) as control for germline mutations. DNA was quantified by dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Eugene, OR, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s recommendations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e2">
<title>Library Preparation</title>
<p>Sequencing libraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep kit (KAPA Biosystems,Cape Town,South Africa) with an optimized manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. In brief, 50ng - 1 &#x03BC;g of genomic DNA was sheared into 350 bp fragments using the Bioruptor Pico, and then underwent end-repairing, A-tailing and ligation with indexed adapters sequentially, followed by size selection using Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Finally, libraries were amplified by PCR and purified for target enrichment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e3">
<title>Hybridization Capture and Sequencing</title>
<p>Different libraries with unique indices were pooled together in desirable ratios for up to 2 &#x03BC;g of total library input. Human cot-1 DNA (Life Technologies,Carlsbad,CA,USA) and xGen Universal blocking oligos (Integrated DNA Technologies,Coralville,IA,USA) targeting 446 lyphoma-related genes were used for hybridization enrichment. The capture reaction was performed with the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Hybridization and Wash Kit (Roche,Madison,WI,USA) and Dynabeads M-270 (Life Technologies,Vilnius,Lithuania) with optimized manufacturers&#x2019; protocols. Captured libraries were on-beads amplified with Illumina p5 and p7 primers in KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa). The post-capture amplified library was purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads and quantified by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification kit (KAPA Biosystems, Cape Town, South Africa). Library fragment size was determined by the Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Enriched libraries were sequenced on Hiseq 4000 NGS platforms (Illumina) to targeted mean coverage depths of at least 100x for whole blood control samples, and 5000x for cfDNAs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e4">
<title>Sequence Data Processing</title>
<p>Trimmomatic was used for FASTQ file quality control (QC). Reads from each sample were mapped to the reference sequence hg19 (Human Genome version 19) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA-mem, v0.7.12). VarScan2 was employed for detection of somatic mutations. Annotation was performed using ANNOVAR on hg19 reference genome and 2014 versions of standard databases and functional prediction programs. Genomic fusions were identified by FACTERA with default parameters. Copy number variations (CNVs) were detected using ADTEx (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://adtex.sourceforge.net">http://adtex.sourceforge.net</ext-link>) with default parameters. An IOF or a plasma sample was defined as ctDNA-positive if any somatic mutations detected in the 446 gene panel. All mutations were confirmed by the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV v2.3). The CNVs of each gene in the 446 gene panel were estimated from the calculation of CNVs by Control-FREEC. The KEGG signal analysis were analyzed by KOBAS 3.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn">http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn</ext-link>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Comparisons of the cfDNA concentration and mutations were analyzed by Student&#x2019;s t-test for normally distributed data, and Mann Whitney test for non-normally distributed data. Data were presented as the median (IQR, 25&#x0025; percentile, 75&#x0025; percentile). An alpha value of p&#x003C;0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 19.0).</p>

<title>Demographic, Clinical and Laboratory Data of Patients in Training Group</title>
<p>A total of 23 presumed VRL patients had been tested for genetic mutation analysis in ZOC from April 1st 2018 to March 1st 2021. These patients including 17 VRL patients and 6 uveitis patients, who got clear diagnosis after clinical examination and follow-up treatment, were enrolled as a training group and analyzed retrospectively. The demographic, clinical and laboratory data of patients in the training group were summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The IOF samples from the one checked eye of every patient in the training group were collected before treatment and sent for diagnostic tests. At the diagnostic stage, 7 paired AH and VF samples for diagnostic analysis from 7 patients were simultaneously collected by anterior chamber puncture and vitrectomy. Unpaired samples included those samples of which only VF or AH was available for analysis. Sixteen unpaired samples, 10 AH samples and 6 VF samples were collected from 16 patients respectively. At the same time, 22 blood samples and 9 CSF samples from the 23 patients were also collected.</p>
<p>A total of 17 patients (17/23, 73.91&#x0025;) were diagnosed as VRL: 5 (21.74&#x0025;) were pathologically diagnosed, and 12 (52.17&#x0025;) were clinically diagnosed. Of the 12 clinical VRL patients, 10 (83.33&#x0025;) had IL-10/IL-6 ratio &#x2265;1 and responded well to systemic and/or local anti-tumor therapy; 2 had symptoms alleviated after MTX intravitreal injection, although the IL-10/ IL-6 ratio was &#x003C;1. Among these 17 VRL patients, 5 had gene rearrangements test and 4 out of them (sensitivity 80&#x0025;) turned out to be positive. Meanwhile, 6 patients (6/23, 26.09&#x0025;) were proven to be chronic uveitis with different etiology, including autoimmune uveitis, virus uveitis and diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation. One of uveitis patients diagnosed as uveitis was negative for cfDNA mutation analysis but had a very high concentration of IL-10 in IOF. The elevated IL-10 made the diagnosis confused, but the patient had symptoms alleviated after the anti-virus and glucocorticoids treatment for 6 months and got remission at present. Among these 23 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of IL-10/IL-6 ratio were 88.24&#x0025; and 83.33&#x0025; respectively.</p>

<p>Two of 6 uveitis patients (patient 18 and patient 20) were ctDNA positive. Patient 18 was presented with severe vitreous opacity in left eye in October 2020. He had a history of ankylosing spondylitis and uveitis for 20 years. His vision fluctuated due to irregular immune suppressive treatment. The condition improved after vitrectomy surgery and achieved remission with Adalimumab treatment for 1 year. The mutation of IKZF3 at a MAF of 39.6&#x0025; was detected in his AH sample, with a ctDNA concentration of 57062 hGE/ml. And the IL-10/IL-6 ratio was less than 1. Patient 20 was diagnosed as autoimmune uveitis, he alleviated after immune suppressive agent treatment, and drugs had been discontinued since one year ago. Four mutations at a mean MAF of 8.1&#x0025; were detected in his AH sample, including ASXL1, CHEK2, POT1 and FLT4. The ctDNA concentration (7292 hGE/ml) was relatively lower than the ctDNA concentration of VRL patients [56040 (IQR 50682, 79880) hGE/ml in AH]. Elevated IL-10 was not detected in his AH sample. Remarkably, all of these 5 mutations found in uveitis patients were not common in B-cell lymphomas.</p>

<title>Validation of cfDNA genetic mutation analysis as a diagnostic method for VRL</title>
<p>To consolidate our findings, 5 cases of VRL (3 pathological diagnosed VRL and 2 clinically diagnosed VRL) and 5 cases of uveitis were selected as a validation cohort from Ophthalmic center in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, China, to validate the value of genetic mutation analysis of IOF for VRL diagnosis. A total of 10 VF samples from these patients were send for cfDNA mutation test, for it&#x2019;s relatively more sufficient for mutation analysis than AH in sample bank of Chaoyang Hospital. It turned out that all of the 5 VRL patients were ctDNA positive, while 5 uveitis samples were ctDNA negative (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>Genetic Subtypes and lymphocyte differentiation pathways of genetic mutations of VRL patients</title>
<p>The genetic subtypes involved in different mutations of lymphocyte differentiation pathway, have distinct clinical outcomes. COO (Cell of origin) classification of DLBCL has been the most commonly use subtyping method for prognostic. In this study, we first classified the VRL patients into germinal-center B-cell-like (GCB) and non-GCB by applying the classifier described by Scherer et al<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>)</sup>. It was found that 95.5&#x0025; (21/22) of the VRL patients were non-GCB subtype, except patient 17 was unclassified (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Recently, George et al.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)</sup> established a LymphGen probabilistic algorithm which facilitate the application of DLBCL genetic subtyping, which was associated with the response to chemotherapy. By applying it, we next determined the subtype of each VRL patient. The nosology covered 86.36&#x0025; (19/22) of VRL patients, including 17 (77.27&#x0025;) were MCD, and 2 (9.09&#x0025;) were BN2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Patient 17, who was unclassified by COO classification, classified as BN2 subtype in LymphGen algorithm with 0.76 confidence.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>VRL, a non-Hodgkin lymphoma of DLBCL, is an aggressive cancer with high mortality<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>)</sup>. The pathogenesis of VRL is largely unknown and diagnose of VRL remains a challenge for clinicians. Liquid biopsy, such as the detection and analysis of ctDNA has been emerged to be a valuable diagnostic method recently<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>)</sup>. In our study, we explored the diagnostic value of genetic mutation analysis in IOF with mini-invasion by NGS using a panel containing 466 tumor-related genes for VRL diagnosis. In training group, all of the VRL patients were positive for mutation detection in IOF (sensitivity 100&#x0025;), and 2 out of 6 uveitis patients were positive (specificity 67&#x0025;). However, the mutations detected in uveitis patients were identified as clonal hematopoiesis mutations. In validation group, both the sensitivity and specificity of cfDNA genetic mutation analysis for VRL diagnosis were 100&#x0025;. Meanwhile, it was found that both the AH and VF samples shown the same value in mutation detection for VRL diagnosis. Beside above, we also found that the top five mutated genes in VRL patients were PIM1 (21/22, 90.91&#x0025;), MYD88 (77.27&#x0025;), CD79B (50.00&#x0025;), ETV6 (50.00&#x0025;) and IRF4 (50.00&#x0025;) with PI3K-Akt signaling pathway alternation. Among 22 VRL patients, 21 patients (95.45&#x0025;) were classified as non-GCB while 1 patient was unclassified subtype. Using the LymphGen probabilistic algorithm, 77.27&#x0025; of VRL patients were classified as MCD subtype, and 2 patients (9.1&#x0025;) were BN2 subtype.</p>
<p>All VRL patients, including the patients of training group and validation group, were detected with abundant genetic mutations in cfDNA of IOF, which indicated a huge possibility of the presence of tumor cells (100&#x0025; sensitivity). Previous studies had presented additional liquid biopsy tools to detect mutations to support the VRL diagnosis. Unfortunately, the sensitivity was not satisfied because the types of mutations they tested were limited. The panel of 466 tumor-related genes we applied had an advantage of tracking novel or rare mutations in VRL, thus it was comprehensive enough for VRL diagnosis with 100&#x0025; sensitivity. In addition, in this study the diagnostic value of genetic mutations of AH and VF samples were compared. We found that although the concentration of cfDNA and ctDNA were significantly higher (P=0.002 and 0.002) in VF samples, the mean of MAF, the number of genetic mutations, the types and frequencies of the top 12 high-frequency mutations were similar. In consideration of safety and simplicity of anterior chamber paracentesis, it is suggested that genetic mutation analysis using a targeted panel sequencing in AH was a feasible method for VRL diagnosis clinically.</p>
<p>It was noticed that two AH samples from 6 uveitis patients of training group were positive for genetic mutation analysis. However, the detected mutant genes (IKZF3, ASXL1, CHEK2, POT1, FLT4) were not common in B-cell lymphoma, yet were considered to be the clonal hematopoiesis mutations<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)</sup>. The clonal hematopoiesis was a common aging-associated process that involved the leukemia-associated mutations accumulation in the hematopoietic stem cells<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>)</sup>. Thus, it was crucial to make a comprehensive analysis of the clinical characteristics, the allele frequencies the of mutations and the specificity of the detected mutated genes when getting a positive result. The detection of abundant high-frequency mutations, especially the reported genes derived from VRL patients, made a greater possibility of VRL diagnosis. In regard of these, we needed more cases to optimize and establish a more specific panel of VRL-related genes for VRL diagnosis. Meanwhile, because it was the first diagnostic accuracy study using this tumor-related gene panel for mutation analysis in VRL patients, we set the cut-off of mutations number as zero which contributed to the false positives in training group. A perspective study to explore an optimal cut-off for VRL diagnosis would be urgently needed.</p>
<p>In training group, IL-10/IL-6 ratio of IOF samples were checked in all 23 patients, while IGH gene rearrangements were tested in 5 VRL patients. The results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of IL-10/IL-6 ratio were 88.24&#x0025; (15/17) and 83.33&#x0025; (1/6) respectively, while the sensitivity IGH gene rearrangements were 80&#x0025; (4/5), which were consistent with literature reports<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>)</sup>. The sensitivity of IL-10/IL-6 ratio and IGH gene rearrangements were lower than the genetic mutation analysis in our study.</p>
<p>Pathological features and molecular classification had shown the potential clinical utility on lymphoma treatment and prognosis. In our study the VRL patients were characterized by the high mutation frequencies of PIM1, MYD88, CD79B, ETV6 and IRF4. Based on their genomic abnormalities, 21 patients (95.45&#x0025;) were classified as non-GCB subtype, which was consistent with the previous findings that, the non-GCB subtype accounted for the main proportion of CNS lymphoma<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>)</sup>. In 2018, Schmitz et al. extended the DLBCL into MCD, BN2, N1 and EZB subtypes, which had been proved to be associated with the response to chemotherapy<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>)</sup>. Using the LymphGen probabilistic algorithm<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)</sup>, 77.27&#x0025; of VRL patients were classified as MCD subtype, and 2 patients (9.1&#x0025;) were BN2 subtype. It was reported that the viability of MCD cells was likely sustained by BCL2, thus the treatment targeting BCL2 may be effective against MCD. And BN2 had favorable survival comparing with MCD in DLBCL<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>)</sup>. However, there was lack of study on the genetic molecular classification and signaling pathway of VRL. In our study, we presented the genetic mutation profile and revealed the molecular characteristics of VRL, which might provide great value for the investigation of the pathogenesis and treatment strategy of VRL in the future.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it was proved that the genetic mutation analysis of cfDNA in IOF using a 466-gene-panel was a minimally-invasive and feasible testing for VRL diagnosis. These 466 genes contained in our panel were comprehensive enough for VRL diagnosis with 100&#x0025; sensitivity. However, the huge set of genes contained some unspecific genes for VRL contributing to the specificity of 67&#x0025;, which called for more cases to optimize and establish a more specific panel for VRL. Meanwhile, the analysis was informative enough to track genetic profile for VRL, which could reveal genetic heterogeneity and molecular characteristics of VRL. It may contribute to targeted treatment in future.</p>
