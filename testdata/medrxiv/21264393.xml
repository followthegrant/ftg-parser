<title>Summary</title>
<sec>
<title>What is known and objective</title>
<p>Racial differences in adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines have not been sufficiently studied. Here, we aimed to study the adverse events of Moderna&#x2019;s intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine in young Japanese people.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A case-control study was conducted using a questionnaire survey. Risk factors were determined using a multivariable logistic regression model. We also compared the occurrence of systemic adverse events in three pairs (minor and adult; male and female; and occurrence and non-occurrence of adverse events after the first dose). Propensity matching was used to balance variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We analysed 3,369 data points (1,877 after the first dose and 1,492 after the second dose) obtained from a questionnaire survey of 7,965 vaccinated individuals. Comparing the results of the first and second doses, the incidence of local adverse events did not change significantly; however, the incidence of systemic adverse events increased significantly (p &#x003C; 0.001). Eighty-three percent of the participants complained of local adverse events, and 65&#x0025; of participants complained of systemic adverse events. Anaphylaxis occurred in one female student (0.03&#x0025;). Even when an adverse event occurred, most of the symptoms improved within 3 days. Female sex was associated with systemic adverse events after the first and second doses with odds ratios (ORs) (95&#x0025; confidence interval, CI) of 2.49 (2.03&#x2013;3.06), and 1.83 (1.28&#x2013;2.61), respectively. Age (&#x003C;20 years: minor) was associated with systemic adverse events after the first dose with an OR of 1.80 (1.44&#x2013;2.24).</p>
<p>The results of the analysis of six cohorts that were created using propensity score matching showed that the incidence of systemic adverse events at the first dose in females was significantly higher than that in males, and that of minors was significantly higher than that of adults.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>What is new and conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this study clarified, for the first time, the risk factors for several adverse events from the injection of Moderna&#x2019;s intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine in young Japanese people.</p>
<p>This study suggests that women, minors who experienced adverse events after the first dose, those who experienced adverse events after the first dose, and those who had adverse events after the second dose, should be aware of adverse events.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>What is known and objective</title>
<p>The COVID-19 crisis has been spreading worldwide, and the number of infected people is increasing due to the emergence of mutant strains. The COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be effective in preventing coronavirus infection and disease aggravation.</p>
<p>In Japan, priority groups, such as healthcare workers and the older adults (aged 65 and over), were the first to be vaccinated. Workplace vaccinations began on 21 June 2021 at universities and businesses; university employees and students have also been vaccinated.</p>
<p>In June 2021, in Japan, Moderna&#x2019;s intramuscular injection of the COVID-19 vaccine was used for vaccination in places associated with students and corresponding teaching staff. However, as of September 2021, the Comirnaty intramuscular injection vaccine had been used for healthcare workers and elderly people ahead of other COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>Adverse events of the Comirnaty intramuscular injection vaccine in healthcare workers and elderly people and that of Moderna&#x2019;s intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine in the defence forces, who were prioritised for administration, are currently being studied. However, adverse events associated with the intramuscular injection of Moderna&#x2019;s COVID-19 vaccine in young people have not yet been well studied in Japan. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In addition, racial differences in adverse events following coronavirus vaccines have not been sufficiently studied.</p>
<p>We have already reported adverse events associated with the first dose of Moderna&#x2019;s intramuscular injection of its COVID-19 vaccine. In Japan, the intramuscular injection of Moderna&#x2019;s COVID-19 vaccine will continue to be used in large-scale inoculation venues such as universities and workplaces.</p>
<p>Therefore, to clarify the adverse events following coronavirus vaccination in the young Japanese population, we conducted a questionnaire survey after the second dose for students, faculty, and staff who belong to an educational foundation, Kyushu Bunka Gakuen.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A case-control study with a questionnaire survey was conducted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1b">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>The study population included people who were vaccinated with Moderna&#x2019;s intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>This vaccination drive included students attending educational facilities run by the educational foundation Kyushu Bunka Gakuen, universities, junior colleges, cooking training facilities, training facilities for dental hygienists, and high schools.</p>
<p>In addition, the vaccination drive included those employed by local companies related to the educational foundation of Kyushu Bunka Gakuen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1c">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Information regarding early adverse events that occurred immediately after vaccination at the site was obtained from the medical records.</p>
<p>To obtain information on the adverse events that occurred after leaving the site, we conducted a questionnaire survey on a website created for this survey using Google Forms. The Japanese Ethics Guidelines for Epidemiological Studies stipulate that the use of existing medical records in observational studies can be used without the consent of individual patients by disclosing information about the purpose and conduct of the study and guaranteeing the opportunity for refusal. An explanation of this study is provided on the website of the Nagasaki International University. Consent to participate in the study was obtained individually.</p>
<p>In addition to assessing adverse events related to vaccination, we obtained the following: type of adverse event, date of occurrence, period of occurrence, and medication/care.</p>
<p>In addition, other attributes (age, sex, allergy history, and history of adverse events to previous medications) were also obtained. Fever was defined as an increase of more than 1 &#x00B0;C from the usual body temperature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1d">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Patient demographics and answers to the questionnaire were summarised with frequencies and percentages for categorical data and median plus range for continuous data.</p>
<p>We compared the patients who experienced adverse events (AE group) with those who did not experience adverse events (No-AE group) using the Wilcoxon ranked-sum test for continuous variables and Fisher&#x2019;s exact test for dichotomous variables. Differences were considered significant at p &#x003C; 0.05.</p>
<p>The incidence was calculated for each adverse event, and Fisher&#x2019;s exact test was performed to compare the first and second doses.</p>
<p>To estimate the risk factors of adverse events, we first evaluated the odds ratios (ORs), 95&#x0025; confidence intervals (95&#x0025; CIs), and p-values of each potential risk factor using unadjusted logistic regression models. Second, we determined the risk factors using a multivariable logistic regression model.</p>
<p>Statistical significance was determined if the 95&#x0025; CIs did not include 1.00 in logistic analyses.</p>
<p>Candidate predictors were selected according to a literature review and clinical expertise. We selected six variables, including patient demographics (age, sex, allergy history, history of adverse events to past medications, history of local adverse events after the first dose of vaccination, and history of systemic adverse events after the first dose vaccination). Age, a continuous variable, was categorised as minor (&#x003C;20 years) or adult.</p>
<p>Finally, we compared the occurrence of systemic adverse events in three pairs (minors and adults, male and female, and occurrence and non-occurrence of adverse events after the first vaccine dose). Propensity matching was used to balance variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> One-to-one matching without replacement was completed using nearest neighbour matching within a calliper (0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>To estimate the propensity score, we fitted a logistic regression model using variables such as age (minor or adult), allergy history, and history of adverse events to past medications. The occurrence of local or systemic adverse events was also used to estimate propensity scores after the second inoculation.</p>
<p>After matching the propensity scores, the statistical balance between the two groups was evaluated. A standardised difference (Std diff) of &#x003C;0.1 suggests adequate variable balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> For comparison of the categorical variables, the McNemar test was employed. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP Pro 16 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p>

<title>Adverse events after leaving the vaccination site</title>
<p>The incidence of each adverse event is presented in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Local and systemic adverse events were generally mild. After the first dose, 82&#x0025; of the participants complained of local adverse events. Injection site pain was the most common local adverse event (71&#x0025;). Systemic adverse events occurred in 48&#x0025; of participants. The most common systemic adverse event was myalgia (34&#x0025;), followed by general fatigue (31&#x0025;). In contrast, after the second dose, 85&#x0025; of the participants complained of local adverse events after the second dose. Injection site pain was the most common local adverse event (69&#x0025;). Systemic adverse events occurred in 88&#x0025; of participants. The most common adverse event was fever (81&#x0025;), followed by general fatigue (75&#x0025;). Comparing the results of the first and second doses, the incidence of all systemic adverse events increased significantly (p &#x003C; 0.001). The incidence of local adverse events, such as swelling, thermal sensation, redness, and itching, also increased significantly (p &#x003C; 0.001).</p>

Injection site pain occurred from day 0 to day 1 and continued for 2 days. However, almost all symptoms improved without any treatment. Eleven percent of the participants used pain medication after the second dose. The symptoms improved within a few days for most adverse events. The onset of systemic adverse events, such as fever and malaise, often occurred the day after injection, and these adverse events resolved within a few days in most people. Systemic symptoms in many people improved with the administration of antipyretic analgesics, such as acetaminophen.</p>

<p>After the first dose, 75&#x0025; of those who developed symptoms did not undergo any treatment, and 17&#x0025; were administered acetaminophen. General fatigue often occurred on the day of injection (94&#x0025;) and continued for 2&#x2013;3 days thereafter (66&#x0025;).</p>
<p>In contrast, after the second dose, for those who developed local adverse events, more than 86&#x0025; did not undergo any treatment, and most showed improvement within 3 days. However, many people who developed systemic adverse events used drugs. In particular, 88&#x0025; of people who developed fever used antipyretic analgesics, such as acetaminophen. However, most of the symptoms improved within 3 days, and few people visited a medical institution.</p>

<title>What is new and Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this study clarified, for the first time, the risk factors for several adverse events from the intramuscular injection of Moderna&#x2019;s COVID-19 vaccine in young Japanese people.</p>
<p>Moderna&#x2019;s intramuscular COVID-19 vaccine efficacy after the second dose was 94.1&#x0025; in preventing COVID-19 among those without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Currently, this vaccine requires two doses to be fully effective, with the second dose having a higher frequency of adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> In this study, which compared the occurrence of adverse events after the first and second doses, the results showed that the second dose had an increase in all systemic adverse events and in many local adverse events. This is consistent with the results of other reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a previous study, we reported that minors aged &#x003C;20 years were at greater risk of systemic adverse events from Moderna&#x2019;s intramuscular injection of the COVID-19 vaccine after the first dose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> However, the same results were not observed for the second dose.</p>
<p>According to a report by the Japanese Defence Forces, local pain incidence tends to be higher in older people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>However, other adverse events decrease with increasing age. In comparison with the Comirnaty intramuscular injection, there is less tendency for the incidence to decrease due to older age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Based on the results of our multivariable logistic analysis, being a minor was found to be an independent influencing factor for systemic adverse events as well as fever after the first dose of Moderna&#x2019;s intramuscular injection COVID-19 vaccine, but minors were not shown to be independent influencing factors for systemic adverse events and fever. In contrast, adults were more likely to have local adverse events, such as redness, induration, and itching, after the second dose.</p>
<p>Second, the results of this study show that female sex is a major risk factor for many adverse events, except for local pain and induration.</p>
<p>Previous reports showed that women are more likely to develop anaphylaxis immediately after vaccination than men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Similarly, in the present study, more women than men had symptoms immediately after vaccination. The reasons why female participants have stronger immunity and a higher incidence of autoimmune diseases are not clear. However, sex hormones, such as oestrogen, contribute to the development and activity of the immune system, accounting for differences in gender-related immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> The ratio of naive B cells before vaccination and the ratio of activated CD8-positive T cells after vaccination are detected as immunological features that positively correlate with the increase in antibody titre after vaccination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> The results of this study showed that female participants had a higher incidence of adverse events.</p>
<p>According to a study by the Chiba University in Japan, the older the age, the lower the antibody titre, and it has been reported that women of all ages have higher antibody titres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, from the results of the multivariable analysis, it was reported that the female sex is a factor that tends to increase antibody titres after vaccination, and that older age is also a factor because antibody titres do not easily increase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> The relationship between antibody titres and side reactions was not investigated in the present study. This may need to be analysed in detail in the future.</p>
<p>In this study, to obtain information on AEs that occurred after leaving the vaccination site, we conducted a questionnaire survey on a website. Therefore, the existence of a reporting bias cannot be completely ruled out. This is one of the limitations of the present study.</p>
<p>This study suggested that women, minors who experienced adverse events after the first dose, those who experienced adverse events after the first dose, and those who had adverse events after the second dose, should be aware of adverse events.</p>
<p>However, even if an adverse event occurs, most of the symptoms improve within 3 days, and the adverse events can be appropriately managed by taking antipyretic analgesics such as acetaminophen. The COVID-19 vaccine has also been shown to be effective against mutant strains, such as the delta strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> COVID-19 has a higher risk of severe effects than post-vaccination adverse events, and vaccination is now recommended for patients with heart disease and pregnant women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> The population does not need to be overly afraid of adverse events, and it is recommended that those at high risk make as many advanced preparations as possible, such as having antipyretic analgesics at hand, food for several days, and taking a few days off after vaccination. It is important to note that people must be vaccinated.</p>
