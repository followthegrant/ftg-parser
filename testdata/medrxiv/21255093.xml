<title>Abstract</title><p>To better understand the factors underlying the continued incidence of clinical episodes of falciparum malaria in E-2020 countries targeting elimination, we have characterised <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> disease transmission dynamics after a clonal outbreak on the northwest coast of Ecuador over a period of two years. We apply a novel, high-resolution genotyping method, the &#x201C;<italic>var</italic>code&#x201D; based on a single PCR to fingerprint the DBL&#x03B1; region of the 40-60 members of the variant surface antigen-encoding <italic>var</italic> multigene family. <italic>Var</italic> genes are highly polymorphic within and between genomes, with <italic>var</italic> repertoires rapidly evolving by outcrossing during the obligatory sexual phase of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in the mosquito. The continued incidence of clinical malaria after the outbreak in Ecuador provided a unique opportunity to use <italic>var</italic>codes to document parasite microevolution and explore signatures of local disease transmission on the time scale of months to two years post-outbreak. We identified nine genetic <italic>var</italic>codes circulating locally with spatiotemporal parasite genetic relatedness networks revealing that diversification of the clonal outbreak parasites by sexual recombination was associated with increased incidence of clinical episodes of malaria. Whether this was due to chance, immune selection or sexual recombination per se is discussed. Comparative analyses to other South American parasite populations where <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission remains endemic elucidated the possible origins of Ecuadorian <italic>var</italic>codes. This analysis demonstrated that the majority of clinical cases were due to local transmission and not importation. Nonetheless, some of the <italic>var</italic>codes that were unrelated to the outbreak <italic>var</italic>code were found to be genetically related to other South American parasites. Our findings demonstrate the utility of the <italic>var</italic>code as a high-resolution surveillance tool to spatiotemporally track disease outbreaks using variant surface antigen genes and resolve signatures of recombination in an E-2020 setting nearing elimination.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2016 the WHO identified 21 countries, known as the E-2020 countries, having the potential to eliminate local transmission of malaria by 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, with seven of them in Latin America at the time (Paraguay and El Salvador have since been declared malaria-free). Malaria transmission in many of these E-2020 countries is epidemic/unstable with risks of outbreaks and resurgent malaria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The elimination target requires a local reduction to zero incidence of indigenous cases. As progress is made towards elimination in these countries, it becomes critical to understand risk factors for disease transmission while maximizing limited funds and resources to examine individual cases. Ecuador is one of the five remaining E-2020 countries in Latin America. National malaria elimination efforts have largely focused on tropical areas, specifically the northwest coast and the Amazon region. These areas border non E-2020 countries, Colombia and Peru, that still have endemic transmission. Thus, rather than low transmission, Ecuador has epidemic/unstable <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission with <italic>P. vivax</italic> the dominant species causing clinical malaria infections.</p>
<p>Clinical cases caused by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in Ecuador are mostly concentrated in the northwest coast, where a steady decrease in annual reported clinical cases was observed from 2009 (161 cases) until late 2012 (44 cases)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. A localized outbreak from November 2012 until November 2013 in Esmeraldas City documented 151 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases, the majority of cases (76&#x0025;) in the northwest coast and Amazon region during this time period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Population genetic analyses using microsatellite markers demonstrated that this outbreak was caused by the clonal expansion (i.e., single-source) of a residual parasite lineage previously reported on the north coast of Peru and on the coast of Ecuador<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Immediately after the outbreak, 31 cases were reported in 2014 and 189 cases in 2015 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. It was unclear whether the clonal outbreak had contributed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> clinical cases since 2013, with the factors underlying sustained disease transmission in Ecuador poorly understood. Moreover, Ecuador was categorized as &#x201C;off-track&#x201D; in the most recent E-2020 progress report and has not met the elimination target due to malaria resurgence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This points to an urgent need to better understand disease transmission patterns and whether clinical cases are due to imported or locally-acquired parasites.</p>
<p>Molecular surveillance of malaria in Latin America has focused on non E-2020 countries, e.g. Colombia, Brazil, Peru and Panama where malaria is endemic and transmission is moderate to low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This surveillance has relied on genotyping neutral molecular markers such as microsatellites or single-nucleotide polymorphisms. However, neutral markers, considered relatively slowly evolving, may not provide enough discriminatory resolution to define parasite evolution in relevant epidemiological time (1-2 years) in areas of low or epidemic and unstable transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Genes under selection can provide an alternative but complementary view of microevolution and they are key to examine population adaptation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this context, the microbiological paradigm for the surveillance of diverse pathogens is to study transmission dynamics using the genes encoding the major surface antigen to reflect pathogen transmission dynamics in relation to immune selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The failure to observe this paradigm in the malaria field has stemmed from both the misconception that neutral markers track transmission dynamics in relation to immunity and the fact that the genetics of the <italic>var</italic> genes encoding the major surface antigen of the blood stages (PfEMP1) are considered &#x201C;too complex&#x201D;. Single copy antigen genes under much less selection have become an alternative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Instead, we have embraced the complexity of the <italic>var</italic> system to understand the population genetics of <italic>var</italic> genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> in multiple locations in Africa, South America, and globally to present here a way to explore transmission dynamics through the lens of these immune evasion genes.</p>
<p>Each genomic <italic>var</italic> repertoire of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> consists of 40 to 60 members of the <italic>var</italic> multigene family with evidence that South American parasites may have fewer <italic>var</italic> genes, e.g. 42 <italic>var</italic> genes (excluding <italic>var2csa)</italic> reported in the Honduran laboratory strain HB3 after whole genome sequencing and assembly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Our analysis of a South American dataset with a global dataset also showed fewer <italic>var</italic> genes in South American isolates as did a Brazilian data set <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. As <italic>var</italic> genes lie on almost all of the 14 chromosomes of the haploid <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> they undergo independent assortment during conventional meiosis to create new <italic>var</italic> repertoires as recombinants of parental <italic>var</italic> repertoires. During infection, differential switching between these genes in a repertoire enables immune evasion in the human host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> thereby regulating parasite density and risk of clinical infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Indeed, several serologic studies examining anti-PfEMP1 antibody responses in naturally-infected children have shown that the acquisition of anti-PfEMP1 protective immunity is variant-specific and susceptibility to clinical episodes is dependent on gaps in the individual&#x2019;s pre-existing antibody repertoire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A body of work defining the population genomics of the <italic>var</italic> multigene family by ourselves and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> has demonstrated that <italic>var</italic> genes provide a promising biomarker for surveillance over epidemiological time scales (1-10 years). <italic>Var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; sequences can resolve population structure at global, continental, regional and local scales in areas of varying endemicity in Africa, Oceania, and South America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Characterization of these major surface antigen genes also provides information about circulating repertoires of variants to enable measurement of immune responses. Translation of <italic>var</italic> population genetics in different epidemiological settings leads us to propose a new surveillance approach we call <italic>var</italic>coding. This is essentially a fingerprinting method to describe the diversity of these genes within and between human hosts as well as repertoire diversification by sexual recombination, with Bayesian statistics to account for missing data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Defining the 2012-2013 clinical disease outbreak in Ecuador as a baseline, we applied the <italic>var</italic>code methodology to characterize the transmission dynamics of clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases during and up to two years after the outbreak. Reconstruction of parasite genetic relatedness networks in space and time revealed that parasites with recombinant <italic>var</italic> repertoires were predominantly associated with the continued incidence of clinical cases after the outbreak. Further comparative analyses to published data from South American isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> elucidated possible origins of Ecuadorian parasites, demonstrating that the majority of clinical cases were due to local transmission and not importation. Our findings also demonstrate the translational application of the <italic>var</italic>code as a high-resolution tool to detect, spatiotemporally track immune evasion genes as well as resolve signatures of recombination in E-2020 or low transmission settings.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><italic>Var</italic>coding was completed for 58 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates that were collected between 2013 and 2015 in endemic areas of the northwest coast and Amazon region of Ecuador (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) from individuals of all ages presenting with malaria symptoms and confirmed <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-positive by microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests. These isolates represent 21&#x0025; of the total cases reported in 2013, 61&#x0025; in 2014 and 3&#x0025; in 2015 (60&#x0025; of the cases reported in January, 7&#x0025; in May and 8&#x0025; in November). For more details on the sampling scheme and bioinformatics workflow see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>. Overall, we identified 195 unique <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; variants or types from 2,141 DBL&#x03B1; sequences from the 58 isolates, representative of the diversity circulating in Ecuadorian <italic>P. falciparum</italic> populations, as indicated by accumulation curves approaching a plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Defining <italic>var</italic>codes circulating in Ecuador</title>
<p>To define distinct <italic>var</italic>codes circulating locally in Ecuador, we estimated parasite genetic relatedness by calculating the similarity index, Pairwise Type Sharing (P<sub>TS</sub>) and a Bayesian version of the same (Bayesian pairwise type sharing; BP<sub>TS</sub>, see Methods). BP<sub>TS</sub> estimates include statistical uncertainty due to differences in isolate repertoire size (i.e. the number of DBL&#x03B1; types identified in each isolate repertoire), enabling a rigorous examination of relatedness. The median repertoire size in Ecuadorian isolates was 37 DBL&#x03B1; types (range: 11-43 types, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>), which is in line with the expected number of <italic>var</italic> genes in the Honduran laboratory reference strain HB3 (n&#x003D;42 <italic>var</italic> genes excluding <italic>var2csa</italic>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>). Nonetheless, we used a uniform prior distribution for repertoire sizes between 40 and 50 types, which accounted for the possibility of missing data in total isolate repertoire sizes using degenerate primers for <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; PCR. For a further analysis to validate our PCR and sequencing methodology, including a further sub-classification of DBL&#x03B1; types into upsA and non-upsA groups and their respective isolate genomic proportions, see Methods and Supplementary Text 1.</p>
<p>We constructed genetic relatedness networks at a threshold of P<sub>TS</sub> &#x2265; 0.90 to identify putatively identical genomes within the margin of error of detection of all DBL&#x03B1; types in an isolate. We confirmed this definition by comparing <italic>var</italic>codes derived from P<sub>TS</sub> to those derived from posterior mean BP<sub>TS</sub> estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>), and by examining the lower and upper bounds of the 95&#x0025; highest density posterior intervals (HDPIs). This revealed nine genetically distinct <italic>var</italic>codes in this study with <italic>var</italic>code4, <italic>var</italic>code5, <italic>var</italic>code9 seen only once and at the other extreme 36 isolates had <italic>var</italic>code1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Fig. S4a</xref>). We were unable to confirm whether any of the Ecuadorian <italic>var</italic>codes were circulating pre-outbreak as samples were not available. As expected, the outbreak <italic>var</italic>code1 was clonal (indicated by HDPIs that included 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5d</xref>), as previously demonstrated by microsatellite genotyping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. It is worth noting that even though we only sampled 30 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates in Esmeraldas City from 140 (21&#x0025;) outbreak cases in 2013, the fact that the disease outbreak was clonal and represented 91&#x0025; of the 154 total cases on the northwest coast and Amazon region during 2013, means that we characterized a representative sample of the cases from the outbreak and during that year.</p>

<p>For each pairwise comparison, we calculated the HDPI width as an estimate of uncertainty (analogous to calculating the width of a frequentist confidence interval) and found there was high confidence (HDPI width &#x2264;0.2) for 94.6&#x0025; (632/668) of pairwise BP<sub>TS</sub> estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Fig. S4b</xref>). Low confidence pairwise BP<sub>TS</sub> estimates (HDPI width&#x003E;0.2; max &#x003D; 0.33) were found only between the two <italic>var</italic>code1 isolates with the smallest repertoire sizes (11 and 19 DBL&#x03B1; types; 36/36 comparisons). This lower statistical confidence follows naturally from under sampling of those isolates&#x2019; DBL&#x03B1; types. After aggregating the within-<italic>var</italic>code pairwise comparisons, there was high confidence in the definition of all <italic>var</italic>codes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. S5a-b</xref>).</p>
<p>For comparison of relatedness by microsatellite genotyping, we calculated Pairwise Allele Sharing (P<sub>AS</sub>) using previously published microsatellite data for the same isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Not surprisingly, 7 microsatellites did not resolve the nine <italic>var</italic>codes but only identified four, three of which were single parasite isolates, at the threshold of P<sub>AS</sub> &#x2265; 0.90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Fig. S6a</xref>). Because two of the seven microsatellite markers were fixed in the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, we also generated the relatedness networks at the threshold of P<sub>AS</sub> &#x2265; 0.80, which allowed for an error of detection of 1 microsatellite allele. However, the majority of isolates clustered at this threshold and only three <italic>var</italic>codes were resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Fig. S6b</xref>). There were several pairwise comparisons (14&#x0025;, 72/541 by P<sub>TS</sub> and 6&#x0025;, 31/541 by BP<sub>TS</sub>) where <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates were found to be identical by microsatellites (P<sub>AS</sub> &#x003D; 1) but much less related by <italic>var</italic> (P<sub>TS</sub> or BP<sub>TS</sub> &#x2264; 0.50, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). Nevertheless, the relationship between P<sub>TS</sub> and P<sub>AS</sub> scores was positively correlated (Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficient &#x003D; 0.757, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Fig. S7a</xref>).

<title>Persistent association of clinical cases with the same <italic>var</italic>codes over time and large distances</title>
<p>We next explored whether parasites with the same <italic>var</italic>codes caused clinical episodes after the outbreak. Persistent disease transmission over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) and large distances (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e-f</xref>) was found as the same <italic>var</italic>codes were identified post outbreak and sometimes in different sampling locations. The median time between first and last identification of the same <italic>var</italic>codes with any clinical case was 216 days or approximately 7 months (range &#x003D; 190 &#x2013; 823 days) during the study period. For example, the outbreak <italic>var</italic>code1 identified in Esmeraldas City was also identified in San Lorenzo, Esmeraldas (&#x223C;150km from Esmeraldas city) in 2013, then Cascales, Sucumbios (&#x003E;300km away) in 2014, and then in Tobar Donoso, Carchi (&#x223C;150km away) in 2015 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). This is in line with an earlier study using microsatellites that showed that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates from the outbreak were genetically related to an Ecuadorian parasite isolate collected around 1990<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.

<title>Spatiotemporal genetic relatedness networks reveal signatures of recombination</title>
<p>We next reconstructed spatiotemporal genetic relatedness networks to explore signatures of local disease transmission and parasite microevolution after the outbreak. We applied a P<sub>TS</sub> threshold of &#x2265;0.50 to detect recombinant and/or genetically-related <italic>var</italic>codes. By using the date and location where each isolate was collected, we animated the network chronologically to examine spatiotemporal disease transmission dynamics during the outbreak in 2013 and post-outbreak in 2014 and 2015 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c, 3f</xref>, GIF). This analysis resolved parasite microevolution relevant to disease transmission after the outbreak and revealed that four <italic>var</italic>codes (<italic>var</italic>code3, <italic>var</italic>code4, <italic>var</italic>code6, <italic>var</italic>code7) were recombinants of the outbreak <italic>var</italic>code1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). The remaining <italic>var</italic>codes did not cluster in the network and were genetically distinct. These patterns were confirmed using BP<sub>TS</sub> estimates based on posterior means (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Fig. S8a</xref>) and their corresponding 95&#x0025; HDPIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. S5c-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">S8b-c</xref>). For the <italic>var</italic>codes that were recombinants and/or genetically-related (i.e., cluster in the networks in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Fig. S8a</xref>), 70.9&#x0025; (433/611) of the HDPIs were confidently above the threshold of BP<sub>TS</sub> &#x2265;0.50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. S5d</xref>). For <italic>var</italic>codes that were genetically-distinct (i.e., do not cluster in the networks), 98.4&#x0025; (368/374) of the HDPIs were confidently below the threshold of BP<sub>TS</sub> &#x2264;0.50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. S5f</xref>). As expected, the relatedness networks based on the 7 microsatellites did not resolve these patterns since all isolates were connected at the threshold of P<sub>AS</sub> &#x2265; 0.50 and genetic relatedness was overestimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Fig. S9a</xref>). Indeed, we were not always able to discriminate recombinants from genetically distinct parasites since several pairwise comparisons (25&#x0025;, 307/1232 by P<sub>TS</sub> and 16&#x0025;, 196/1232 by BP<sub>TS</sub>) that resulted in P<sub>AS</sub> &#x2265; 0.50 were found to be less related by <italic>var</italic> (P<sub>TS</sub> or BP<sub>TS</sub> &#x2264; 0.50) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). Furthermore, the majority of recombinants were classified as essentially clonal since they clustered together at the threshold of P<sub>AS</sub> &#x2265; 0.80 (allowing for differences in one microsatellite allele, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Fig. S6b</xref>).</p>
<p>We were able to detect that <italic>var</italic>code3 was in fact a recombinant of the outbreak <italic>var</italic>code1, even though it was sampled in San Lorenzo during the same time period as the ongoing outbreak in 2013 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c, 3e</xref>). With the available data we were unable to confirm whether <italic>var</italic>code3 was &#x2018;imported&#x2019; to San Lorenzo from Esmeraldas City. The most plausible explanation is that the recombination event occurred in San Lorenzo during the outbreak. Parasites with recombinant <italic>var</italic>code3 caused clinical episodes in multiple locations in 2014 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). The other recombinant <italic>var</italic>codes (<italic>var</italic>code4, <italic>var</italic>code6, <italic>var</italic>code7) were identified after the outbreak in 2014 or 2015. Whether the recombinant <italic>var</italic>codes resulted from sexual recombination events between outbreak <italic>var</italic>code1 and genetically distinct parasites that were already circulating at low levels and/or in asymptomatic reservoirs in Ecuador (e.g. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>) or those that were previously imported could not be ascertained from the current study population. Interestingly, all the recombinant <italic>var</italic>codes were identified in San Lorenzo indicating this area is a transmission hot spot and a reservoir of parasites with diverse <italic>var</italic> repertoires (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p>
<p>To further visualize the genetic profiles of <italic>var</italic>codes and confirm the observed recombination signatures, we constructed a clustered heatmap based on the presence and absence of the 195 DBL&#x03B1; types across all isolates, such that isolates with similar genetic profiles cluster together (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). This analysis confirmed that in the case of isolates identified as recombinants of the outbreak <italic>var</italic>code1 (i.e., <italic>var</italic>code3, <italic>var</italic>code4, <italic>var</italic>code6, <italic>var</italic>code7), a proportion of outbreak DBL&#x03B1; types as well as different DBL&#x03B1; types were present. This is consistent with the generation of a new <italic>var</italic>code through outcrossing between two genomes with different <italic>var</italic> repertoires by conventional meiosis (i.e., approximately &#x2265;50&#x0025; sharing of DBL&#x03B1; types). By contrast, the genetic profiles of <italic>var</italic>codes 2, 5, 8, and 9 had different DBL&#x03B1; types, leading to the definition as parasites with genetically distinct <italic>var</italic>codes. When using 7 microsatellites, these recombination signatures in the genetic profiles were not identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Fig. S9b</xref>).</p>

<title>Parasites with recombinant <italic>var</italic>codes most frequently caused <italic>P. falciparum</italic> clinical episodes following the 2012-13 outbreak</title>
<p>Prior to the outbreak there had been a steady decline in clinical cases, however, increased incidence of disease occurred after the outbreak. Therefore, we analyzed trends in the epidemiology of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases that occurred post-outbreak to understand if there were any key risk factors. Of the 25 individuals in our study that had a clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> episode after the outbreak in 2014 or 2015, we had age data for 18 individuals (72&#x0025;, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There was no significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis test, <italic>p</italic> &#x003D; 0.65) in the median age of individuals experiencing clinical episodes caused by parasites with the outbreak <italic>var</italic>code1 (19 years, range &#x003D; 19 &#x2013; 57 years, N &#x003D; 3 patients), a recombinant of <italic>var</italic>code1 (i.e., <italic>var</italic>codes 3, 4, 6, or 7) (25 years, range &#x003D; 17 &#x2013; 58 years, N &#x003D; 13 patients), or by a different <italic>var</italic>code (34.5 years, range &#x003D; 32 &#x2013; 37 years, N &#x003D; 2 patients). A greater diversity of <italic>var</italic>codes (1-9 inclusive) was associated with incidence of clinical malaria post-outbreak than during the 2013 outbreak (<italic>var</italic>codes 1,2,3). Indeed in 2014, 79&#x0025; of thecases sampled were caused by either parasites with the outbreak <italic>var</italic>code1 (21&#x0025;) or with any of the four recombinants of <italic>var</italic>code1 (58&#x0025;). The trend was similar in 2015 with 83&#x0025; of the cases sampled caused by either parasites with the outbreak <italic>var</italic>code1 (33&#x0025;) or with any of the four recombinants of <italic>var</italic>code1 (50&#x0025;), although our sampling of reported cases in 2015 after January was limited. Importantly, overall we found that 80&#x0025; of the cases we sampled after the outbreak were caused by either parasites with the outbreak <italic>var</italic>code1 (24&#x0025;) or with any of the four recombinants of <italic>var</italic>code1 (56&#x0025;), especially with varcode7. Thus, disease transmission after the outbreak in 2014 and into 2015 was predominantly associated with parasites with recombinant <italic>var</italic> repertoires of the outbreak clone.</p>

When we combined the sequences from Ecuadorian isolates with those previously sequenced, we identified 543 unique <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; types in South America (compared to 458 in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>). This is largely representative of the <italic>var</italic> diversity circulating in South American <italic>P. falciparum</italic> populations, as indicated by sampling accumulation curves approaching saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). <italic>Var</italic>coding resolved a total of 97 <italic>var</italic>codes in South America (P<sub>TS</sub> &#x2265; 0.90), with those identified in each country ranging from 9 in Ecuador and Venezuela, to 56 <italic>var</italic>codes in French Guiana (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Supplementary Fig. S11</xref>). The number of <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; types per isolate repertoire was low in all countries and indicative of only one <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome infecting an individual (i.e. repertoire size &#x2264; 60, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).

(d) A network visualization of the genetic relatedness of South American <italic>var</italic>codes at the threshold of PTS &#x2265;0.50. Due to the differences in time points and sample collections, for this analysis a genetically-related parasite did not necessarily reflect a recent transmission event. Every node represents a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolate and an edge represents the PTS value between two particular nodes/isolates. Isolates/<italic>var</italic>codes that cluster together (i.e., connected by edges) are genetically-related. (e) Relatedness of Ecuadorian <italic>var</italic>codes to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> populations from South America.

<p>To examine whether any of the parasites with Ecuadorian <italic>var</italic>codes were genetically related to other South American parasites, we constructed regional spatiotemporal relatedness networks and applied our threshold of P<sub>TS</sub> &#x2265; 0.50 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). We identified a genetically-related Peruvian <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolate that clustered with the outbreak and recombinant <italic>var</italic>codes (P<sub>TS</sub> &#x003D; 0.66-0.75 with <italic>var</italic>code1 isolates). This is consistent with previous analyses using microsatellites showing the outbreak source was possibly a residual parasite lineage circulating in Peru in 1999-2000 and in Ecuador in the early 1990s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. The fact that these isolates did not cluster with anything else suggests the outbreak may have been caused locally due to circulating parasites in unidentified reservoirs. <italic>Var</italic>code5, which was sampled in the Amazon had a very different genetic profile to the other <italic>var</italic>codes (&#x2265;83&#x0025; unique types, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). It is worth noting that the parasite isolate with <italic>var</italic>code5 also had a different genetic background with respect to its microsatellite haplotype as compared to the rest of the Ecuadorian isolates (3 of 7 unique microsatellite alleles). The epidemiological data for the putative infection location was recorded as possibly imported from Peru (EC40, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, our analysis would suggest that this <italic>var</italic>code is more related to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> populations from French Guiana and Venezuela. Nonetheless, Peruvian isolates also clustered with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates from French Guiana even though they did not cluster with <italic>var</italic>code5 and we found that 53&#x0025; of the types identified in <italic>var</italic>code5 were also identified in Peruvian parasites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). We were able to determine a putative importation of a Colombian parasite (<italic>var</italic>code9, EC53, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). The <italic>var</italic>codes 2 and 8 did not cluster with any other South American isolate suggesting parasites with these <italic>var</italic>codes may be local to Ecuador. The epidemiological data for the putative infection location for <italic>var</italic>code8 was recorded as Colombia (EC49 and EC50, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Although it did not cluster with Colombian <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates in our network analysis, we found that 67&#x0025; of the types identified in <italic>var</italic>code8 (collapsing all 3 isolates) were also identified in Colombian parasites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). For <italic>var</italic>code2, we found that 44&#x0025; of the types identified in <italic>var</italic>code2 were also identified in Colombia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>), providing evidence that parasites with <italic>var</italic>code2 and <italic>var</italic>code8 may represent residual parasites previously or recently imported from Colombia.</p>

Indeed, conservation of the DBL&#x03B1; types in all <italic>var</italic>codes was observed in space and time to varying degrees (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). We also found conservation of DBL&#x03B1; types on a continental scale with the number of the same types identified in any two or three countries being 124 (23&#x0025;) and 59 (11&#x0025;), respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Moreover, even DBL&#x03B1; types that were identified in relatively low frequencies in Ecuador (i.e., identified in a few <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates) were also identified in the South America dataset, often at relatively high frequencies in other countries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">Supplementary Fig. S12</xref>).

<title>No evidence of recombination in any DBL&#x03B1; type over the course of the outbreak</title>

DBL&#x03B1; types are very variable, with the average pairwise identity of the sequences encoding this domain being approximately 42&#x0025;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.

In total, we report 1,283 independent observations of the same 41 DBL&#x03B1; types identified in 36 cases with <italic>var</italic>code1 assessed over 2 to 3 years (any type was identified in a median of 34 infections, ranging from 1 to all 36 infections) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Supplementary Fig. S13a</xref>). Given our threshold of P<sub>TS</sub> &#x2265;0.90 to identify putatively identical <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; repertoires, only 10 of the 47 DBL&#x03B1; types found in the outbreak clone were not found in the majority of the isolates with <italic>var</italic>code1 (median frequency &#x003D; 1, max &#x003D; 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Supplementary Fig. S13a</xref>). Four of these were identified in the cases with recombinant <italic>var</italic>codes (median frequency &#x003D; 17.5, range &#x003D; 6-19), two of which were also identified in the Peruvian isolate that clustered with the outbreak/recombinants in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>, suggesting they are also conserved. The other 6/10 were singletons in the entire dataset (including the South America data) and could be a consequence of the PCR with degenerate primers and/or low-quality DNA.</p>
<p>Among the 15 cases with recombinant <italic>var</italic>codes (<italic>var</italic>codes 3,4,6, and 7), we report 339 independent observations of 39 of the 47 outbreak DBL&#x03B1; types. There were 26-27 outbreak types shared between <italic>var</italic>code1 and the recombinant <italic>var</italic>codes 3,4, and 7, and 17 types between <italic>var</italic>code1 and <italic>var</italic>code6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Supplementary Fig. S13b</xref>). These findings highlight the conservation of DBL&#x03B1; types of the outbreak clone in space and time, a pattern further supported by the fact that 31 of 47 outbreak DBL&#x03B1; types were found among previously recorded South American isolates (in 2002 to 2008<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Supplementary Fig. S13c</xref>). This evidence points to conservation of these types despite the many transmission events that must have occurred between 2002 and 2013-15 across South America. We found that the highest number of outbreak DBL&#x03B1; types were identified in Peru (N&#x003D;28, 60&#x0025;) followed by Colombia (N&#x003D;14, 30&#x0025;) and Venezuela (N&#x003D;8, 17&#x0025;), and the lowest in French Guiana (N&#x003D; 2, 4&#x0025;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Fig. S9c</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our investigation of the spatiotemporal incidence of clinical episodes of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in Ecuador by <italic>var</italic>coding supports the view that disease transmission after the 2012-2013 outbreak was sustained predominantly by Ecuadorian parasites. We observed persistence of the outbreak clonal lineage (identified with the same <italic>var</italic>codes) and outcrossing of this lineage with other locally circulating parasites causing clinical cases, rather than recent importation of clonally transmitted parasites. Our results point to the need for resources to be focused locally in Ecuador to uncover the circulating asymptomatic reservoirs of infection identified by <italic>var</italic>code recombination events. A role for human mobility must also be considered in the spread of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> as parasites with the same <italic>var</italic>codes were also observed across large distances (&#x223C;150-300km).</p>
<p>San Lorenzo was found to be a transmission hotspot likely due to mining activities and occupation-related travel in these areas, as well as its proximity to the Ecuador-Colombia border<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. These findings point to San Lorenzo for both genetic surveillance and targeted interventions. Importantly, our results provide strong evidence for ongoing transmission in Ecuador and provide the first baseline characterization of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigenic diversity and parasite <italic>var</italic>codes circulating in the northwest coast and Amazon regions of Ecuador. It is worth noting that several recent outbreaks have occurred in the same areas of Ecuador (in 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, 2019<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> and 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>) with malaria transmission remaining unstable rather than endemic.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that 58&#x0025; of clinical cases sampled in 2014 immediately after the outbreak in Ecuador were caused by parasites with recombinant <italic>var</italic>codes. The same trend was observed in 2015, although our sampling was limited relative to the number of reported cases for the months sampled. We ask is this a chance finding or a consequence of immune evasion? We hypothesize that these parasites with recombinant <italic>var</italic>codes have new combinations of <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; types that may provide an immunological advantage in a population with variable levels of immunity, as would be expected during elimination campaigns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Network analyses and computational models combining evolution and epidemiology point to variant-specific immune selection defining <italic>var</italic> population structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. In scenarios where transmission is low and there is limited <italic>var</italic> diversity, the chance of recombination is also relatively low and thus immune selection is weaker. Selection in the context of an E-2020 country like Ecuador is likely variable due to the recent transition from moderate to epidemic transmission over the last 15 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> with declining population immunity as a consequence of approaching elimination. Low population immunity would select for circulating clones leading to high similarity between <italic>var</italic> repertoires. Here, the signatures of recently recombined genomes with the outbreak clone that we detect in four <italic>var</italic>codes were clearly associated with the continued incidence of clinical disease after the outbreak. Thus parasites with recombinant <italic>var</italic>codes may present a risk factor for disease. We hypothesize that they may be better able to evade variant-specific immunity to PfEMP1 variants expressed by the outbreak clone by sharing 50&#x0025; or less of the DBL&#x03B1; types of the outbreak clone. The availability of <italic>var</italic> DBLa sequences provides the potential to test this hypothesis by serological methods that detect variant-specific immunity. In this context, inferences based on neutral markers do not give information about immune evasion genes and variant-specific immunity, whereas <italic>var</italic>codes identify circulating variants to which individuals can become immune. e.g. as was done in serologic studies in Papua New Guinea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> and the Brazilian Amazon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A previous study that included some of the same <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates from Esmeraldas City and San Lorenzo in the northwest coast described three main genetic clusters based on microsatellite genotyping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. In contrast, when considering the same isolates, <italic>varcoding</italic> resolved six <italic>var</italic>codes circulating in the northwest coast. In this study, as expected comparative analyses to &#x201C;gold-standard&#x201D; microsatellite genotyping demonstrated that <italic>var</italic>coding provided higher discriminatory resolution to detect fine-scale genetic variation and describe parasite microevolution related to disease transmission in epidemiological time. These findings were in accordance with the rapidly evolving <italic>var</italic> multigene family due to immune selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, the overall number of microsatellite loci examined and the fact that two loci were fixed in the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> decreasing the denominator of polymorphic microsatellite markers from seven to five. Similar observations have been described in an earlier study in Venezuela where sympatric parasites identical at neutral microsatellite loci were shown to have very different <italic>var</italic> repertoires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. These South American genetic epidemiology studies can be compared to those of a peri-urban area in Senegal where reduced transmission has resulted from intense vector and antimalarial control. In Senegal, highly related genotypic clusters of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates were resolved by both <italic>var</italic> and use of a 24-SNP barcode as neutral loci rather than microsatellite loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Genotyping <italic>var</italic> loci under immune selection in conjunction with neutral loci proves to be informative to validate clonality and avoids the need for whole genome sequencing as a potential rapid response to an outbreak investigation. Even in areas where WGS is routinely conducted, <italic>var</italic>coding has the potential to identify relevant samples for downstream WGS as part of a larger and complementary genomic surveillance framework.</p>
<p>In contrast to the microevolution of parasite <italic>var</italic>codes, we documented conservation of individual <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; types over space and time. This is similar to Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> where we see highly variable but many conserved DBL&#x03B1; types yet rapidly evolving <italic>var</italic> repertoires or <italic>var</italic>codes. Here we observed conservation of the outbreak <italic>var</italic>code1 clone DBL&#x03B1; types after transmission within and between multiple human hosts on the scale of months to two years in Ecuador (1,283 independent observations of the same types when examining 36 cases with <italic>var</italic>code1). Moreover, 110 of the 195 (56.4&#x0025;) Ecuadorian DBL&#x03B1; types were identified across South America over 5 to 13 years (2,130 independent observations of the Ecuadorian DBL&#x03B1; types in 128 different infections from <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>). These observations are consistent with balancing selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> and in line with other studies demonstrating high levels of <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; sequence conservation on the time scale of up to 23 years in Brazil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Another independent example of conservation of DBL&#x03B1; sequences over time is found in a peri-urban area of Senegal over 7 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. This pattern of conservation of <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; types observed in diverse sites confirms the potential of this genetic marker for malaria surveillance.</p>
<p>Of note, the observed conservation of DBL&#x03B1; types in natural infections in humans in Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> and South America would not be predicted by data from <italic>in vitro</italic> passage of long-term cloned lines of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> showing high rates of mitotic recombination within <italic>var</italic> genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Indeed, Claessens et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> reported a very high rate of 2-8 x10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> mitotic recombinants created per erythrocytic cycle for three of four long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured lines, &#x201C;with DBL&#x03B1; domains showing the most recombinations&#x201D;. The clone tree of HB3, selected for passage through mosquitos, did not show any recombinants suggesting that the high rates observed may relate to passage <italic>in vitro</italic>. While we identified conservation rather than diversification of <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; types in space and time, it is possible that mitotic recombinants are generated on the observed time scale but not transmitted. Such is the case in HIV (e.g. reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>). Further exploration of within and between host diversification of <italic>var</italic> genes in natural infections requires a more detailed genomic approach analyzing recently adapted parasite lines.</p>
<p>This is the first case study demonstrating the translational application of the <italic>var</italic>code for outbreak surveillance in epidemic/unstable malaria transmission such as E-2020 settings. Specifically, data presented here have shown that <italic>var</italic>coding was able to resolve the population genetics of sustained disease transmission after an outbreak in Ecuador. We conclude that <italic>var</italic>coding requiring a single PCR with degenerate primers has great potential as a simple, cost effective and high-resolution approach to examine <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigenic diversity in relation to population immunity as well as genome diversification by recombination. This will prove particularly useful in the context of changing patterns of human mobility and gene flow in the Americas where there is high demand for such a diagnostic surveillance method. The tool will also be useful in other epidemic or low transmission settings targeting elimination across the globe.</p>
<p>Here we show that <italic>var</italic> repertoire evolution via sexual recombination was associated with sustained transmission resulting in clinical infections. This is in line with our previous predictions of epidemic disease transmission in South America with parasites with novel <italic>var</italic> repertoires, or <italic>var</italic>codes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and serves as a warning of what may come in terms of monitoring the complexity of malaria resurgence in Latin America with both importation and microevolution of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Surveillance with neutral markers alone cannot investigate this potential risk related to recombination of variant antigen gene repertoires. The widespread migration of Venezuelans has already led to massive increases in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases in Brazil and Colombia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, as well as in the Peru-Ecuador border<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Such migration points to the possibility of importation of diverse parasites with antigenically novel <italic>var</italic> genes as we predicted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and is now also worrisome in the context of increased transmission of malaria in tropical regions due to the diversion of healthcare resources to the COVID-19 pandemic, as recently warned by the WHO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Going the distance to elimination must be supported by appropriate molecular surveillance.</p>

<title>Study design, study area and sample collection</title>
<p>In this molecular epidemiological study, we examined samples that were collected passively from 2013 to 2015 in endemic areas of Ecuador, namely the northwest coast and the Amazon region, as part of ongoing malaria surveillance by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health and patients showing at the local clinics. During 2013, the majority of samples were collected from an ongoing outbreak that occurred in Esmeraldas city, Esmeraldas province. Details of the sample collection are described in S&#x00E1;enz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In 2014 and 2015, the &#x201C;post-outbreak&#x201D; samples were mostly collected from across the northwest coast with few from the Amazon region, reflective of the epidemiology of clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases in Ecuador (Northwest coast: 20 and 173 cases; Amazon: 11 and 16 cases in 2014 and 2015, respectively). Details of the sample collection are described in Vera-Arias et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. It is worth noting that although cases were reported throughout 2015, samples were not available for many of them due to logistical challenges. Briefly, subjects who were diagnosed with falciparum malaria either by light microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test were asked if they wanted to participate in the study and signed an informed consent form. The participants had to: 1) live in the areas where the samples were taken, 2) be over 2 years old, 3) agree to participate, 4) sign an informed consent form, 5) give a blood sample, 6) be able to understand the informed consent. From each participant a blood sample (either venous blood or dried blood spot) was collected as well as their responses to a basic demographic questionnaire (including places recently travelled and their address).

Our customized bioinformatic pipeline has been described in detail in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.

<title>Genetic relatedness analyses</title>
<sec id="s4f1">
<title>Measuring pairwise type or allele sharing</title>
<p>To estimate genetic relatedness among isolates, we calculated the similarity index Pairwise Type Sharing (P<sub>TS</sub>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, as adapted by He et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> to account for differences in <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; sampling across isolates in the case of <italic>var,</italic> and Pairwise Allele Sharing (P<sub>AS</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> in the case of microsatellites and constructed similarity matrices. Because <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is haploid we refer to <italic>var</italic> repertoires and microsatellite haplotypes in the same manner, i.e. a <italic>var</italic> repertoire of DBL&#x03B1; types or a multilocus haplotype of microsatellite alleles transmitted together. Every parasite isolate was compared to every other parasite isolate in the population to determine the proportion of shared loci (i.e. <italic>var</italic> types or microsatellites), but only &#x201C;retrospective&#x201D; pairwise comparisons were analyzed as a conservative approach to account for time order for the Ecuador-specific analyses. In other words, since we were interested in using the outbreak as a baseline this approach allowed us to look at genetic relatedness of an isolate with everything else circulating before its identification. For the comparative analyses with South American data we included all pairwise comparisons and did not correct for time order due to the differences in sampling time points (five to thirteen years before the Ecuadorian isolates were collected).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f2">
<title>Measuring Bayesian pairwise type sharing</title>
<p>Genetic relatedness (or repertoire overlap) can also be explored more rigorously with unbiased Bayesian pairwise type sharing (BP<sub>TS</sub>, Johnson et al <italic>in preparation</italic>), which accounts for uncertainty in P<sub>TS</sub> estimates due to differences in isolate repertoire size. This approach uses Bayesian inference methods, which estimate repertoire overlap and uncertainty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, and uses them in a subsequent P<sub>TS</sub> calculation, carrying that uncertainty forward. The prior distribution for repertoire size, used in inference, was informed by observations as follows. First, the median observed repertoire size in Ecuadorian isolates was 37 types, ranging from 11 to 43 (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). Second, the number of expected <italic>var</italic> genes with DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> domains from whole genome sequencing data of the Honduran laboratory reference strain HB3 was 42 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and 50 <italic>var</italic> genes based on long-read PacBio sequencing of HB3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. And third, based on our sequencing data of 37 technical replicates of HB3, the median repertoire size or number of DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types per isolate was 39 (range 36-41 types), with 40 types consistently identified in the majority of replicates (range 21-37 replicates) (Supplementary Text 1). We therefore used a uniform prior on repertoire sizes between 40 and 50 types, combined with the general Bayesian repertoire overlap framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> to produce unbiased estimates (posterior means). These were used to confirm our P<sub>TS</sub> estimates. As expected, the P<sub>TS</sub> and BP<sub>TS</sub> estimates were positively correlated (Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficient &#x003D; 0.919, <italic>p</italic> &#x003C; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). To measure uncertainty in central estimates, we computed a 95&#x0025; highest density posterior interval (HDPI), a Bayesian version of confidence intervals, for each pairwise estimate. Like a frequentist confidence interval, the width of the HDPI provides a measure of uncertainty of each pairwise comparison. All posteriors were sampled using MCMC.</p>

<title>Interpretation of genetic relatedness measures</title>
<p>Since <italic>P. falciparum</italic> undergoes sexual recombination (i.e. meiosis) in the mosquito, conventional genetic interpretations can be applied to P<sub>TS</sub> and P<sub>AS.</sub> Therefore, pairwise isolate comparisons resulting in a P<sub>TS</sub> or P<sub>AS</sub> of 0 (0&#x0025; shared loci), 0.5 (50&#x0025; shared loci), and 1 (100&#x0025; shared loci) would indicate genetically distinct isolates, recombinant isolates, and clones or genetically-identical isolates, respectively. We applied this approach to define &#x201C;<italic>var</italic>codes&#x201D; as groups of isolates sharing &#x2265;90&#x0025; of their DBL&#x03B1; types (P<sub>TS</sub> &#x2265; 0.90) to identify putatively identical genomes within the margin of error of detection of 1-5 DBL&#x03B1; types in an isolate (i.e., within the margin of error of detection of all DBL&#x03B1; sequences in an isolate using degenerate primers for <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; PCR). We confirmed our interpretations of <italic>var</italic>codes, recombinants and genetically distinct isolates by comparing to unbiased BP<sub>TS</sub> estimates (posterior means) and examining the lower and upper bounds of the 95&#x0025; HDPIs as a measure of the statistical uncertainty of each pairwise comparison.</p>
<p>In the case of microsatellite genotyping, we applied a threshold of P<sub>AS</sub> &#x2265; 0.90 (sharing &#x2265;90&#x0025; of their microsatellite alleles) to define clones and also applied a threshold of P<sub>AS</sub> &#x2265; 0.80 to identify putatively identical genomes within the margin of error of detection of 1 microsatellite allele in an isolate (for comparative purposes to the threshold for <italic>var,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).

<title>Visualization of genetic relatedness networks</title>
<p>To visualize the genetic relatedness among isolates as determined by P<sub>TS</sub> or P<sub>AS</sub>, we constructed networks using the R packages <italic>ggraph</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> and <italic>tidygraph</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> where isolates are depicted as nodes and edges as the P<sub>TS</sub> or P<sub>AS</sub> values at a given threshold. The R package <italic>ggspatial</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> was used to plot spatial networks using latitude/longitude coordinates for sampling location. To visualize genetic relatedness of parasites over time we used the R package <italic>gganimate</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> to construct spatiotemporal relatedness networks. We generated a clustered heatmap based on the presence/absence matrix of DBL&#x03B1; types to visualize the genetic profiles of each isolate in Ecuador and each country in South America using the R package <italic>pheatmap</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> and the &#x201C;complete&#x201D; clustering method. Unrooted neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees based on pairwise genetic distance (calculated as 1-P<sub>TS</sub>) were constructed using the R packages <italic>ape</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> and <italic>ggtree</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>We used R version 3.5.2 for all analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. The package <italic>dplyr</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> was used for further data curating. We used base R and the R package <italic>epiR</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> to perform chi-squared tests for univariate analyses of categorical variables to compare proportions and for non-parametric tests to compare distributions of continuous variables between two groups (Mann-Whitney U test) or among <italic>k</italic> groups (Kruskal-Wallis test) with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. To evaluate how well we sampled the true pool of <italic>var</italic> DBL&#x03B1; diversity (i.e. the true number of genetic variants circulating) in Ecuador and in South America, we used the R package <italic>vegan</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup> to generate species accumulation curves.</p>

<p>As described in the Methods, the degenerate primers we use amplify the DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> domain of <italic>var</italic> genes. We performed an additional validation of our PCR (using these degenerate DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> primers) and sequencing methodology to understand the margin of error of detection of all DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types in an isolate. DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types were translated into amino acid sequences and classified as upsA or non-upsA, using the classifyDBLalpha pipeline (Ruybal-Pes&#x00E1;ntez et al. 2017) to examine whether the expected genomic proportions of upsA/non-upsA were obtained in each isolate.</p>
<p>Given our study was conducted in South America, we used the Honduran laboratory reference strain HB3 as a benchmark for the expected number of total DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types (i.e. repertoire size), as well as the proportion of upsA/non-upsA. Whole genome sequencing of HB3 has identified 44 <italic>var</italic> genes, with 8 upsA DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types (defined by DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> domain 1), 34 non-upsA DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types (DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> domains 0 and 2) and 2 upsE (<italic>var2csa</italic> genes, defined by DBLpam domains and do not have DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> domains) (Rask et al. 2010). We independently verified this using 37 technical replicates of <italic>var</italic> DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> PCR amplification and illumina sequencing of our HB3 laboratory isolate. It is worth noting that since HB3 has two <italic>var2csa</italic> genes that do not have DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> domains, these will not be amplified by our degenerate primers, so we expect that only 42 of the <italic>var</italic> genes of HB3 could be amplified.</p>
<sec id="s5a">
<title>HB3 technical replicates</title>
<p>From the data obtained from 37 HB3 technical replicates, we identified the expected repertoire sizes with a median of 39 DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types (range: 36-41). A median of 7 upsA DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types (range: 6-8) and a median of 33 non-upsA DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types (range: 30-34) were identified (<xref rid="figST1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The median genomic proportion of upsA DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types was 17.5&#x0025; (range: 15.4-19.5&#x0025;) and 82.5&#x0025; (range: 80.5-84.6&#x0025;) for non-upsA DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types (<xref rid="figST2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). We found that of the 46 identified in the 37 technical replicates, 40 of them were consistently identified in the majority of replicate isolates (range 21 to 37 replicates). Of these 40 types, 7 were ups-A and 33 were non-upsA. All of these findings are in line with what is expected from whole genome sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Rask et al. 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Field isolate genomic proportions of upsA and non-upsA DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types</title>
<p>The 543 unique DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types identified in the 186 South American <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates (N &#x003D; 58 Ecuadorian P. falciparum isolates from this study, N &#x003D; 128 previously published <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates from Colombia, French Guiana, Peru and Venezuela) were translated into amino acid sequences and classified as upsA or non-upsA, using the classifyDBLalpha pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Ruybal-Pes&#x00E1;ntez et al. 2017</xref>).

<title>Inheritance of DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types in the recombinant <italic>var</italic>codes</title>
<p>For the outbreak <italic>var</italic> code1, its 47 DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> types were classified as 5 upsA and 42 non-upsA. In <xref rid="figST5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> we look specifically at the &#x201C;inheritance&#x201D; of upsA (blues) vs non-upsA (greens) types from the parental outbreak <italic>varc</italic>ode1 in the case of the parasites with recombinant <italic>var</italic> codes (<italic>var</italic> codes3,4,6,7). This provides a proxy to examine inheritance of types with regards to their chromosomal location. The proportion of the outbreak types that were inherited in the recombinant parasite <italic>var</italic> codes is indicated in the darker shades of blue or green, showing that the proportion of inherited types varied both by <italic>var</italic> code and upsA/non-upsA. Overall, the DBL<italic>&#x03B1;</italic> type sharing patterns in parasites with recombinant varcodes are consistent with inheritance of 50&#x0025; types, with a higher proportion of non-upsA inherited types (&#x223C;40-70&#x0025;, i.e. 17 to 30 of the 42 types) vs upsA (&#x223C;20-50&#x0025;, i.e. 1 to 3 of the 5 upsA types). The exception was <italic>var</italic> code7 where 60-80&#x0025; of upsA were inherited, i.e. 3-4 of the 5 upsA types. The lighter shades correspond to those types that were not inherited from the outbreak clone but from the other parent.</p>
