<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to excess fat accumulation in the liver. In animal experiments and human kinetic study, we found that administration of combined metabolic activators (CMA) promotes the oxidation of fat, attenuates the resulting oxidative stress, activates mitochondria and eventually removes excess fat from the liver. Here, we tested the safety and efficacy of CMA in NAFLD patients in a placebo-controlled 10-week study. We found that CMA significantly decreased hepatic steatosis and levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, uric acid, and creatinine, whereas found no differences on these variables in the placebo group after adjustment for weight loss. By integrating clinical data with plasma metabolomics and inflammatory proteomics as well as oral and gut metagenomics data, we revealed the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with the reduced hepatic fat and inflammation in NAFLD patients and identified the key players involved in the host-microbiome interactions. In conclusion, we observed that CMA can be used develop a pharmacological treatment strategy in NAFLD patients.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), defined as the hepatic fat accumulation of &#x2265;5&#x0025; unrelated to alcohol consumption and other liver diseases, comprises pathologies that include hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, and hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anstee <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). NAFLD is closely associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Due to the rapid rise in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes; it is the leading cause of chronic liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Estes <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Younossi <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Globally, at least one in four people have hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abeysekera <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bugianesi, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Current management strategies, including lifestyle modification, increased physical activity, and dietary intervention, have limited adherence and minimal prolonged success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alferink <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Romero-G&#x00F3;mez <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sanyal, 2019</xref>). No drugs have been approved to treat NAFLD, and effective treatment options with long-term safety are urgently required. Although research is paving the way for the development of therapeutics, the results of early clinical trials of drugs targeting single pathways have been mostly unsuccessful. Combining compounds that reduce lipid accumulation and hepatocellular injury has been proposed as a more suitable therapeutic strategy for this complex disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barbier-Torres <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barbier-Torres <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ertunc &#x0026; Hotamisligil, 2016</xref>). Targeting multiple pathways is more likely to translate into successful outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Friedman <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mardinoglu <italic>et al</italic>, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mardinoglu <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>A key mechanism in the pathogenesis of NAFLD is inadequate removal of hepatic fat by fatty acid oxidation. Our previous work combining in-depth multi-omics profiling and hepatocyte-specific integrated networks identified three landmark metabolic features of hepatic steatosis: limited serine availability, reduced <italic>de novo</italic> glutathione (GSH) synthesis, and altered nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&#x002B;) metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mardinoglu <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mardinoglu <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that NAFLD could be treated with combined metabolic activators (CMA), including L-carnitine tartrate to facilitate mitochondrial fatty acid uptake from cytosol; the NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> precursor nicotinamide riboside to induce hepatic mitochondrial &#x03B2;-oxidation and facilitate fatty acid transfer through the mitochondrial membrane, and the potent glutathione precursors L-serine and N-acetyl-l-cysteine to reduce oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mardinoglu <italic>et al</italic>, 2018b</xref>). We further hypothesized that administration of these metabolic activators would promote mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and oxidation and reduce hepatic fat and inflammation. In animal toxicology studies and a human calibration study for CMA, we found that the metabolic activators were well tolerated and increased the activators&#x2019; plasma levels and their associated metabolites. Additionally, administration of CMA effectively increased fatty acid oxidation and <italic>de novo</italic> glutathione generation, as judged by metabolomic and proteomic profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). In this placebo-controlled phase 2 study, we tested our hypotheses and the efficacy and safety of CMA in NAFLD patients by integrating clinical data with plasma metabolomics and inflammatory proteomics as well as oral and gut metagenomics.</p>

<title>Patient Characteristics</title>
<p>Of 56 patients screened for the trial, 32 met the eligibility criteria (see Methods and Supplementary Appendix) and were randomly assigned to receive treatment or placebo. Twenty-four patients were excluded according to the study protocol (Datasets S1, S2 and S3), and one eligible patient moved to another city before the randomization. Of the remaining 31 eligible patients, 20 were randomly assigned to the CMA group and 11 to the placebo group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). One patient was excluded from analysis as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown. The 30 remaining patients completed the study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). However, because of the COVID-19 lockdown, eight were unable to visit the Day 14 visit&#x2019;s trial site but completed the final visit on Day 70. The patients&#x2019; mean age was 40.4 years (25&#x2013;63 years), and 77.4&#x0025; were men (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ between groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Dataset S4).</p>

<title>CMA Decreases Hepatic Steatosis and Improves Clinical Parameters</title>
<p>Adherence to the treatment regimen was more than 95&#x0025; and did not differ between groups. The primary outcome variable, hepatic fat content as judged from the proton density fat fraction estimated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-PDFF), was lower on Day 70 than on Day 0 in the CMA group (10&#x0025;, p = 0.028) but not in the placebo group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Dataset S3 &#x0026; S4). After adjustment for weight loss, this difference remained significant in the CMA group (p.adj = 0.033) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The serum level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was lower on Day 70 in both in the CMA group (39&#x0025;, p = 0.0003 vs Day 0) and placebo group (22&#x0025;, p = 0.025); however, after weight loss adjustment, the difference remained significant only in the CMA group (p.adj = 5.75e-07, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). On Day 14, the ALT level after weight loss adjustment was significantly lower only in the CMA group (24&#x0025;, p.adj = 0.0015) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Dataset S4). Similarly, the serum level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) on Day 70 vs Day 0 was lower in both the CMA group (30&#x0025;, p = 0.004) and the placebo group (20&#x0025;, p = 0.009); however, after weight loss adjustment, the AST level was significantly lower only in the CMA group (p.adj = 1.58e-05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Dataset S4).</p>
<p>The serum uric acid level was lower in the CMA group on both Day 14 (12&#x0025;, p.adj = 0.003) and Day 70 (15&#x0025;, p.adj = 1.12e-05), both before and after weight loss adjustment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Dataset S4). However, the creatinine level on Day 70 was significantly decreased only in the CMA group (8&#x0025;, p.adj=.0007), both before and after weight loss adjustment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Dataset S4). The serum levels of uric acid and creatinine did not change in the placebo group at either time point (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Dataset S4). Systolic blood pressure on Day 70 was 5&#x0025; lower in the CMA group (p = 0.023), whereas in the placebo group, it was unchanged and diastolic blood pressure had increased (p = 0.038) (Dataset S4).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>CMA Alters Plasma Metabolites</title>
<p>To characterize the patients and reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with the decrease in liver fat and improvement in clinical parameters in the CMA group, we generated untargeted metabolomics data from plasma samples and measured the levels of 1032 metabolites (Dataset S5). After excluding metabolites with missing values in &#x003E;50&#x0025; of samples, 929 metabolites were analyzed (Dataset S5). Metabolites, whose levels on Day 70 and Day 14 vs Day 0 differed significantly both before and after weight loss adjustment, are listed in Dataset S6; those that differed between groups are listed in Dataset S7.</p>
<p>Plasma levels of serine, nicotinamide, and carnitine, which are directly associated with CMA, and of metabolites indirectly associated with CMA were significantly higher on Day 70 than on Day 0 in the CMA group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Dataset S6), and those levels were significantly higher than in the placebo group (Dataset S7). Specifically, the plasma levels of N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide, N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, and 1-methylnicotinamide (associated with NR and NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> metabolism); of N-acetylglycine, N-palmitoylserine, N-oleoylserine, and N-stearoylserine (associated with serine and glycine metabolism); and of deoxycarnitine, acetylcarnitine, and butyrylcarnitine (associated with carnitine metabolism) were significantly higher on Day 70 than on Day 0 in the CMA group (Dataset S6). On the other hand, we found that the plasma level of cysteine associated with NAC showed tendency (p=.052) to be down-regulated on Day 70 vs Day 0 in the CMA group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Dataset S6). Hence, we observed that NAC has different plasma kinetics compared to the other three metabolic activators. We studied the association of the plasma level of individual metabolic activators with the plasma level of the metabolites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, Dataset S8). We provided a mechanistic explanation for the alterations in the plasma level metabolites other than administered metabolic activators.</p>

<p>We found that 110 metabolites differed significantly on Day 70 vs Day 0 (p &#x2264; 0.05) in the CMA group; 44 metabolites were involved in lipid metabolism (Figure S1), and 66 metabolites were involved in amino acids and other parts of the metabolism (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Dataset S6). Of the 66 metabolites that were significantly different on Day 70 vs Day 0 in the CMA group, 4 of them were significantly different in both groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), 62 of them were significantly different in only CMA group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), and 27 of them were significantly different only in the placebo group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Previously, we found that the increased plasma levels of kynurenine and kynurenate were associated with high hepatic fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Mardinoglu <italic>et al</italic>., 2018b</xref>). In a one-day clinical study of the acute effect of CMA on plasma metabolite levels, we found that kynurenine and kynurenate levels were significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). In the current study, plasma levels of kynurenate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) and kynurenine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) was significantly lower on Day 70 vs Day 0 in the CMA group both before and after weight loss adjustment (Dataset S6). On the other hand, the kynurenate plasma level was significantly increased on Day 70 vs Day 0 in the placebo group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, we found that the plasma level of 3-amino-2-piperidone associated with the urea cycle; arginine and proline metabolism were significantly decreased on Day 70 vs Day 0 in the CMA group, whereas its plasma level was significantly increased in the placebo group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Our analysis also revealed decreased metabolism of purine and xanthine in the CMA group on Day 70. Plasma levels of urate, xanthine, hypoxanthine 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil, 1,7-dimethylurate, and theophylline were significantly reduced in the CMA group on Day 70 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, Dataset S6). Consistent with these findings, plasma uric acid levels were significant decreased in this group. N-trimethyl-5-aminovalerate (TMAVA) was the most significantly reduced metabolite in the CMA group on Day 70, both before and after weight loss adjustment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, Dataset S6) and was significantly lower than in the placebo group (Dataset S7). TMAVA is linked to intestinal microbes and associated with lysine metabolism and is one of the best predictors of microalbuminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Haukka <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). In a previous study, the plasma level of TMAVA was significantly increased in NAFLD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> are responsible for metabolizing trimethyllysine to TMAVA, which was further modulated by antibiotic treatment in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). We also found that the plasma level of N,N,N-trimethyl-alanylproline betaine (TMAP) was significantly downregulated in the CMA group on Day 70, even after weight loss adjustment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, Datasets S6), as were creatinine levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Dataset S4). TMAP has been described as a novel potential biomarker of the dialytic clearance that can accurately define kidney function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Velenosi <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>CMA treatment correlated significantly with the plasma levels of serine, glycine, gamma-glutamylglycine, carnitine, TMAVA, 1-methylnicotinamide, N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide, and N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, Dataset S8). But none of these metabolites correlated significantly with the plasma cysteine level, indicating that cysteine utilization differs from that of other metabolites in the CMA.</p>

<title>CMA Reduces Inflammation</title>
<p>Plasma levels of 96 inflammatory protein markers were measured with the plasma proteome profiling platform Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) using an inflammation panel quantifying the plasma level of target proteins. After quality control and exclusion of proteins with missing values in more than 50&#x0025; of samples, 72 proteins were analyzed (Dataset S9). Proteins whose levels differed significantly between the visits in the CMA and placebo groups are listed in Dataset S10. The plasma levels of CD8A, CSF-1, CCL23, FGF-21, and oncostatin-M (OSM) were significantly decreased only in the CMA group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Dataset S10); however, no significant changes of plasma levels of inflammation-related proteins were found in the placebo group (Dataset S10).</p>

<p>The plasma level of FGF-21 is increased in NAFLD patients and is a potential diagnostic marker of NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rusli <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).

<p>The alterations in the gut microbiome have been associated with the NAFLD(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aron-Wisnewsky <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).

<p>We first compared the differences in the species&#x2019; abundances between Day 70 vs Day 0 in the CMA and placebo groups in the gut microbiome.

<p>Next, we compared the abundances of the species between CMA vs placebo groups on Day 70 in the gut microbiome. We found that the abundance of the butyrate-producing species (<italic>Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus, Eubacterium remulus</italic> and <italic>Eubacterium siraeum</italic>) were significantly increased in the CMA group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, Dataset S16 &#x0026; S17). Butyrate is a preferred energy source for gut epithelial cells, and it plays a vital role in maintaining health in humans. Notably, the abundance of acetaldehyde producer <italic>Rothia mucilaginosa</italic> was significantly downregulated in the gut microbiome of CMA group on Day 70 vs Day 0 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) and the placebo group on Day 70 vs Day 0 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, Dataset S16 &#x0026; S17).</p>
<p>Similarly, we compared the differences in the species&#x2019; abundances between Day 70 vs Day 0 in the CMA and placebo groups in the oral microbiome. We found that the abundance of the specific species of Proteobacteria (<italic>Cardiobacterium hominis</italic>), Bacteriodetes (<italic>Prevotella maculosa</italic>) and Actinobacteria (<italic>Corynebacterium matruchotii</italic> and <italic>Actinobaculum</italic> sp oral taxon 183) were significantly decreased in the CMA group (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> &#x0026; Figure S2, Dataset S18).

<p>We evaluated the association of the plasma levels of metabolites directly related with CMA with the abundance of species in the gut microbiome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>) and oral microbiome (Figure S2) and found that <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> is positively correlated with CMA related metabolites; namely cysteine, cysteinyl glycine, sarcosine, and N1-methylinosine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, Dataset S17).

Additionally, we observed that the plasma levels of N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide and N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide are significantly positively correlated with the abundance of <italic>Alistipes shahii</italic> and negatively correlated with the abundance of <italic>Bacteroides cellulosilyticus</italic> and <italic>Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, Dataset S17).</p>
<p>Changes in the gut microbiome are linked to inflammation by triggering molecules involving interleukins and other cytokines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Schirmer <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).

Interestingly, increased abundances of <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> and <italic>Bacteriodes fragilis</italic> in the gut microbiome were positively correlated with the plasma level of CD8A, indicating the key role of the microbiome in the modulation of CD8 T cell responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, S17).</p>
<p>Even though the oral and gut microbiome are distinct, a body of evidence claimed a strong relationship between these microenvironments due to the transfer of oral members to gut by a constant flow of saliva and ingestion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Therefore, we evaluated the species&#x2019; correlation in feces and saliva microbiome and revealed a significant positive correlation between species pairs, where only two pairs were negatively correlated (Figure S3). Interestingly, we found that the abundance of the species belongs to the Prevotella genus in the oral microbiome and the species belong to Bacteroides genus in the gut microbiome are affected apparently from each other&#x2019;s abundance (Figure S3).</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Based on data-driven modelling and systems biology, we have identified a CMA based on four components to increase the liver&#x2019;s fat oxidation and enhance the mitochondrial function in the cells, thus activating hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and &#x03B2;-oxidation along with reducing oxidative stress. To test this hypothesis in a clinical setting, we performed on a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of CMA in NAFLD patients. In this study, we found that CMA (10&#x0025;) reduces the hepatic fat content assessed by MRI-PDFF after 70 days, the primary outcome variable. Secondary outcomes were also significantly improved, including reductions in serum ALT (39&#x0025;) and AST (30&#x0025;) levels. Also reduced were CD8A, CSF-1, CCL23, and OSM levels, as shown by plasma proteomics analysis, indicating that CMA attenuates hepatic inflammation. The positive results were not linked to significant weight loss in the CMA group.</p>
<p>Analysis of untargeted metabolomics data confirmed the expected biological outcomes of CMA treatment. Levels of plasma N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, and 1-methylnicotinamide were increased, suggesting that nicotinamide riboside provides sufficient substrate and NAD<sup>&#x002B;</sup> for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. These metabolites have shown to be increased in a recent study, supporting the insulin-sensitizing ability of the nicotinamide mononucleotide, another NAD&#x002B; intermediate, in skeletal muscle of prediabetic women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yoshino <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Plasma levels of N-acetylglycine, N-palmitoylserine, N-oleoylserine, and N-stearoylserine were also increased, suggesting that CMA treatment improves the serine deficiency associated with hepatic steatosis. More importantly, fatty acid oxidation and carnitine metabolism were remarkably facilitated, as judged from the robust plasma levels of deoxycarnitine, acetylcarnitine, and butyrylcarnitine. Moreover, after weight loss adjustment, the levels of tryptophan metabolites, including kynurenate, kynurenine, and tryptophan betaine, decreased significantly after CMA treatment.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, CMA rapidly reduced uric acid levels. Significantly decreased metabolites associated with the uric acids were shown (Figure S4). Uric acid stimulates hepatic steatosis either directly or by activating NLRP3 inflammasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lanaspa <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wan <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Although the extent to which uric acid reduction contributed to the regression in hepatic steatosis is unclear, it likely had at least an additive effect. How might CMA reduce serum uric acid levels in overweight and obese subjects? A recent study revealed a strong association with uric acid and 1-methyhistidine levels, which is significantly decreased with CMA therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pietzner <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Another possible explanation is that the glycine derived from serine, lowers uric acid levels by stimulating uricosuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Oshima <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Given the significantly reduced level of purine metabolism, it is also possible that L-carnitine inhibited xanthine oxidase activity and uric acid production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Volek <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Further clinical studies that include hyperuricemic patients will be required to determine whether this effect can be generalized to treat patients with hyperuricemia. The direct or indirect impact of the microbiome on NAFLD remains poorly understood. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the gut and oral microbiome in NAFLD patients before and after administration of metabolic activators. Our results collectively indicated that CMA induced literature supported beneficial alterations such as positive correlation with the abundances of <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Grabherr <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Munukka <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>), <italic>Roseburia faecis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tamanai-Shacoori et al, 2017</xref>)</italic> or butyrate producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baxter <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Boesmans <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). In addition to identifying the key species, defining the distinct signatures of the microbiome and liver-related clinical parameters in the well-defined patient cohort is valuable in searching for new biomarkers for NAFLD.</p>
<p>A few limitations of the study need to be considered. First, the study was designed to include 45 participants; however, because of COVID-19 restrictions, only 32 subjects were enrolled. Second, patients who had type 2 diabetes or dyslipidemia or were taking anti-diabetic medications were excluded, which resulted in a more homogenous clinical trial group. Third, hepatic fat content and inflammation were assessed by MRI-based methods and plasma inflammatory protein markers rather than liver histology. Our findings warrant a clinical trial in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis to delineate the effects CMA on hepatic injury and inflammation.</p>
<p>The safety profile of CMA in these patients was consistent with the results of our previous one-day calibration study and clinical trials, including only a single component of the CMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Our present study showed that CMA was safe and well-tolerated in patients with NAFLD, and no major safety concerns were identified. In conclusion, CMA significantly reduced hepatic fat content and serum markers of hepatic injury in 10 weeks. These findings suggest that targeting multiple pathways by CMA is a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for NAFLD.</p>

<title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Trial Design and Oversight</title>
<p>Patients for this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study were recruited at the Ko&#x00E7; University Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey (Dataset S1). The trial was conducted following Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. An independent external data monitoring committee oversaw the safety of the participants and the risk-benefit analysis. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before trial-related procedures were initiated. The study was approved by the ethics committee at Ko&#x00E7; University (Decision No: 2018.351.IRB1.043). The study was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/">https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/</ext-link> with the accession number EudraCT_2018-000894-59 and at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link> with the accession number NCT04330326.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Overweight or obese patients 18&#x2013;70 years of age were enrolled in the trial if they were diagnosed with NAFLD and met all the inclusion criteria: body mass index &#x003E;27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, triglycerides &#x2264;354 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol &#x2264;175 mg/dl, and increased hepatic fat (&#x003E;5.5&#x0025;). Patients were excluded if they carried the PNPLA3 I148M (homozygous for I148M), had ALT or AST levels &#x003E;3-fold higher than the upper limit of normal, or had taken oral antidiabetics, including metformin, within three months. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix. The main characteristics of the study participants are presented in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Dataset S2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Randomization, Interventions, and Follow-up</title>
<p>Patients were randomly assigned to CMA or placebo (2:1). Patient information (patient number, date of birth, initials) was entered into the web-based randomization system, and the randomization codes were entered into the electronic case report form.</p>
<p>CMA treatment was given for 70 days after the initial diagnosis of high hepatic fat by MRI-PDFF. Patients in the treatment group took one dose of CMA (3.73 g L-carnitine tartrate, 1 g nicotinamide riboside, 12.35 g serine, and 2.55 g N-acetyl-l-cysteine) daily for the first 14 days (after dinner) and two doses daily for the next 56 days (after breakfast and dinner). Further information is provided in the Supplementary Appendix.</p>
<p>The subjects returned to the study centre for complete follow-up evaluations, including body composition analysis and adverse events recording. Hepatic fat was determined by MRI-PDFF on Days 0, 14 and 70. Plasma samples for proteomics and metabolomics analyses were obtained on Days 0, 14, and 70. After Day 70, subjects stopped taking their drugs (Dataset S1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Study Outcomes</title>
<p>The study&#x2019;s primary objective was to assess the difference in hepatic fat content, quantified by MRI-PDFF, between subjects treated for 70 days with CMA or placebo (Dataset S3). The secondary objectives were to assess the tolerability and safety profile of CMA, as judged by laboratory analyses and physical parameters (Dataset S4), and to examine additional efficacy parameters, as evaluated by biochemical, metabolomic and proteomics analysis.</p>
<p>The number and characteristics of adverse events, serious adverse events, and treatment discontinuation due to study drugs were reported from the beginning of the study to the end of the follow-up period as key safety endpoints (Supplementary Appendix). Changes in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse, respiratory rate, body temperature, pulse oximetry values), baseline values, and treatment status were recorded by phone contacts between the visits. A complete list of endpoints is provided in the Supplementary Appendix.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis</title>
<p>Plasma samples were collected on Days 0, 14, and 70 (Datasets S5&#x2013;S8) for nontargeted metabolite profiling by Metabolon (Durham, NC). The samples were prepared with an automated system (MicroLab STAR, Hamilton Company, Reno, NV). For quality control purposes, a recovery standard was added before the first step of the extraction. To remove protein and dissociated small molecules bound to protein or trapped in the precipitated protein matrix, and to recover chemically diverse metabolites, proteins were precipitated with methanol under vigorous shaking for 2 min (Glen Mills GenoGrinder 2000) and centrifuged. The resulting extract was divided into four fractions: one each for analysis by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS) with positive ion-mode electrospray ionization, UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion-mode electrospray ionization, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; one fraction was reserved as a backup.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>Inflammatory Protein Markers</title>
<p>In the plasma samples, inflammatory protein markers were determined with the Olink Inflammation panel (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) (Datasets S9&#x2013;S11). Briefly, each sample was incubated with 92 DNA-labeled antibody pairs (proximity probes). When an antibody pair binds to its corresponding antigens, the corresponding DNA tails form an amplicon by proximity extension, which can be quantified by high-throughput, real-time PCR. Probe solution (3 &#x03BC;l) was mixed with 1 &#x03BC;l of sample and incubated overnight at 4&#x00B0;C. Then 96 &#x03BC;l of extension solution containing extension enzyme and PCR reagents for the pre-amplification step was added. The extension products were mixed with detection reagents and primers and loaded on the chip for qPCR analysis with the BioMark HD System (Fluidigm Corporation, USA).To minimize inter and intra-run variation, the data were normalized to both an internal control and an interpolate control. Normalized data were expressed in arbitrary units (Normalized Protein eXpression, NPX) on a log2 scale and linearized with the formula 2<sup>NPX</sup>. A high NPX indicates a high protein concentration. The limit of detection, determined for each of the 92 assays, was defined as three standard deviations above the negative control (background).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4g">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Values are expressed as the mean &#x00B1; standard deviation (SD) (continuous variables) or as n (&#x0025;). Safety and exploratory efficacy endpoints were analyzed in all randomized patients who received CMA. Differences in clinical and physiological variables between time points were analyzed by paired <italic>t-test</italic>, followed by one-way ANOVA to find shifts between CMA and placebo groups at each time point. Missing values were removed in a pairwise fashion.</p>
<p>For analysis of plasma metabolomics, raw data from Day 14 and Day 70 in both groups were scaled to data on Day 0. Metabolite changes in the CMA group vs the placebo group over time (Dataset S6) were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Differences between the CMA and placebo groups on Day 0, Day 14 and Day 70 were also calculated (Dataset S7). Metabolites with a false-discovery rate of 5&#x0025; were considered statistically significant. The calculation was adjusted for weight loss in a linear model using the limma package in R (v4.0.2). Differences were considered significant at p &#x003C; 0.05.</p>
<p>For analysis of plasma proteomics, raw data from Day 14 and Day 70 were scaled to data on Day 0. Subsequently, ANOVA was used to calculate the CMA group changes vs placebo over time (Dataset S10). P &#x003C; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
<p>Finally, Spearman correlation analysis (false discovery rate &#x003C;0.05) was used to analyze the association between individual components of CMA and other metabolites (Dataset S8) and between the significantly altered clinical parameters (e.g., hepatic fat and plasma levels of ALT, AST, uric acid, and creatinine) and other metabolites (Dataset S13). Spearman correlation analysis was also used to study the associations between the plasma protein levels and the plasma metabolite levels (Datasets S12).</p>

<title>Metagenomics Data Analysis</title>
<p>Fresh stool and saliva specimens were collected and preserved using DNA/RNA Shield Fecal Collection tubes (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and DNA/RNA Shield Collection Tube (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA), respectively. DNA extractions from the faecal samples were done using QIAamp PowerFecal Pro DNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the saliva samples using QIAamp DNA Microbiome Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All protocol procedures were performed according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. Quantification of extracted DNA was determined fluorometrically on the Qubit&#x00AE; 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) using the QubitTM dsDNA HS Assay Kit. DNA purity was determined via 260/280 and 260/230 ratios measured on the NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States). The SMARTer Thruplex DNA-Seq (Takara Bio) was used for library preparation (Option:350 bp; Category: low input). Samples were sequenced on NovaSeq6000(NovaSeq Control Software 1.7.0/RTA v3.4.4) with a 151nt (Read1)-10nt(Index1)-10nt(Index2)-151nt(Read2) setup using &#x2018;NovaSeqXp&#x2019; workflow in &#x2018;S4&#x2019; mode flow cell. The Bcl to FastQ conversion was performed using bcl2fastq_v2.20.0.422 from the CASAVA software suite. The quality scale used is Sanger /phred33/Illumina 1.8&#x002B;.</p>
<p>Raw paired-end metagenomics data were analysed using Metaphlan3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Beghini <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) to extract each sample&#x2019;s taxonomic profiles. The abundant data were then analysed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to identify the species different between subjects with no steatosis compared to the other groups. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyse the associations between selected analytes and the taxonomic abundance data. The correlation between oral and gut metagenomics data (by filtering the species with abundance &#x003E; 1&#x0025; in at least 5 data points). The <italic>SciPy</italic> package was used. All analyses were done using Python 3.</p>
