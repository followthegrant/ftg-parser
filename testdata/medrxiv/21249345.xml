<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>While diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine development in the COVID-19 pandemic has proceeded at unprecedented speed and scale, critical gaps remain in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Current diagnostic strategies, including serology, have numerous limitations in addressing these gaps. Here we describe clinical performance of T- Detect&#x2122; COVID, the first reported assay to determine recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and immune repertoire profiling from whole blood samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Methods for high-throughput immunosequencing of the TCR&#x03B2; gene from blood specimens have been described<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. We developed a statistical classifier showing high specificity for identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, utilizing &#x003E;4,000 SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR sequences from 784 cases and 2,447 controls across 5 independent cohorts. The T-Detect COVID Assay comprises immunosequencing and classifier application to yield a qualitative positive or negative result. Several retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled to assess assay performance including primary and secondary Positive Percent Agreement (PPA; N=205, N=77); primary and secondary Negative Percent Agreement (NPA; N=87, N=79); PPA compared to serology (N=55); and pathogen cross-reactivity (N=38).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>T-Detect COVID demonstrated high PPA in subjects with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (97.1&#x0025; 15&#x002B; days from diagnosis; 94.5&#x0025; 15&#x002B; days from symptom onset), high NPA (&#x223C;100&#x0025;) in presumed or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative cases, equivalent or higher PPA than two commercial EUA serology tests, and no evidence of pathogen cross-reactivity.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>T-Detect COVID is a novel T-cell immunosequencing assay demonstrating high clinical performance to identify recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection from standard blood samples. This assay can provide critical insights on the SARS-CoV-2 immune response, with potential implications for clinical management, risk stratification, surveillance, assessing protective immunity, and understanding long-term sequelae.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has resulted in a global pandemic of over 75 million cases and 1.7 million deaths worldwide in 2020<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Despite rapidly accumulating data and recent approvals of vaccines, key gaps remain in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, including the nature and durability of the correlates of protection, the relationship between immune response and individual disease susceptibility and severity, and the possibility that some immune phenotypes may be more advantageous or efficient at preventing infection or severe disease<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Such knowledge gaps translate into critical areas of unmet need in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and epidemiologic monitoring of the pandemic. Currently, serologic (antibody) testing of IgM, IgG, and/or IgA isotypes is the primary modality for evaluating prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure, disease prevalence and incidence, and immune protection<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. While antibody testing has been shown to capture a larger percentage of exposures than PCR testing<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, its performance has a number of limitations, including low or absent antibody titers in individuals with asymptomatic or mild infection<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, declines in antibody levels over time<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, and false-positive results from cross-reactivity to other viruses, infections, or unrelated autoimmune conditions<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. There is also wide variability in performance across the numerous SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests currently available<sup><xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. In addition, it remains unclear whether the results of antibody testing correlate with long-term protective immunity or prevention of transmission<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Finally, serologic testing may not reflect the true extent of individual pre-existing immunity, as SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells have been identified in 20-50&#x0025; of individuals with no known exposure<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. These issues have severely limited the utility of serologic testing to inform individual risk or guidance of public behavior, including physical distancing, mask wearing or resumption of activities<sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent reports showing declining levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies only a few months after infection, particularly in asymptomatic individuals, have fueled concerns that achieving long-term immunity to SARS-CoV-2, whether by natural infection or by vaccination, will be challenging<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. This is supported by accumulating data regarding SARS- CoV-2 reinfections in as few as 2 months following initial infection<sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. The observation that pan-Ig antibody titers appear stable up to 4 months following diagnosis suggests that long-term immunity to SARS-CoV-2 involves complex and multifactorial mechanisms, including the action of long-lived plasma cells and coordination between the humoral and cellular immune responses<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. It is not known what proportion of exposed individuals will exhibit a memory antibody response, although early data suggest that &#x223C;10&#x0025; of individuals recover from SARS- CoV-2 infection yet have no detectable antibodies<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to the humoral response, cellular responses play a central role in SARS-CoV-2 immunity<sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Indeed, the majority of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including convalescent patients across a wide spectrum of disease severity, generate CD8&#x002B; and CD4&#x002B; T- cell responses<sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, which have been associated with milder disease and protection from infection<sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. T cells also play a critical role in activating the humoral response and can precede antibodies to serve as the first sign of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in asymptomatic or mild illness<sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. SARS-CoV-2&#x2013;specific T cells are persistent, remaining elevated at least 6 months post-infection, in some cases in the absence of seroconversion<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Finally, aberrant T- or B-cell responses have been implicated in the immune dysregulation underlying severe COVID and inflammatory sequelae including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and in adults (MIS-A)<sup><xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, myocardial involvement<sup><xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, and post-acute syndromes such as &#x201C;long COVID<sup><xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.&#x201D; Exploration of the precise contributions and timing of both humoral and cellular responses is needed to fully understand the biological basis for long-term immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated complications. This has become particularly salient with the advent of mass vaccination strategies for COVID-19, where identifying the correlates of vaccine-mediated immunity is central to assessing the durability of protection, whether pre-existing immunity influences the vaccine response<sup><xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, and whether recently-reported viral escape mutants with enhanced infectivity<sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> can evade vaccine-induced immunity.</p>
<p>A number of features inherent to the biology of the T-cell immune response make it a desirable target for identifying and tracking disease exposure. The cellular immune response is: 1) sensitive to very small amounts of antigen; 2) specific, binding only to specific antigens; 3) naturally amplified through clonal expansion; 4) systemic, as T-cell clones circulate in the blood; and 5) persistent, as it is maintained in long-term memory. Here we describe the implementation and extensive clinical validation of T-Detect&#x2122; COVID, a novel high-throughput assay to determine recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on T-cell receptor gene sequencing and subsequent repertoire profiling from whole blood samples, following US Food and Drug Administration guidance &#x201C;<italic>Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised) May2020.&#x201D;</italic> We demonstrate high positive and negative percent agreement of this assay to identify or exclude prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases across several cohorts and longitudinal timepoints. We also show that the assay has equivalent or better performance than commercially-available EUA antibody tests at all timepoints evaluated<sup><xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, and lacks cross-reactivity to several viral and/or respiratory pathogens.</p>

<sec id="s2">
<title>METHODS</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Ethics</title>
<p>All samples were collected pursuant to an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved clinical study protocol. For residual samples collected under prospective study protocols, informed consent was obtained from participants. All other samples from cohorts described below were collected as clinical remnant samples. (See Supplement for detailed information).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Clinical Cohorts</title>
<p>Clinical specimens were collected via distinct study arms: 1) a retrospective arm with SARS- CoV-2 positive and negative residual samples from prior research studies and remnant clinical samples; and 2) a prospective arm to collect samples from participants with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and testing either positive or negative by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. These two study arms provided samples to demonstrate the clinical agreement of the T-Detect&#x2122; COVID Assay to determine the PPA and NPA. Study populations are described below and in the Supplement.</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>PPA Study Cohorts</title>
<p>The primary PPA study evaluated residual blood samples (N=222) from subjects diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the EUA Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test from a single US reference lab (New York) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="21249345v1_tbl1.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Secondary PPA assessments were performed using both retrospectively and prospectively collected samples from multiple cohorts (N=77; ImmuneRACE and ImmuneSense&#x2122; COVID-19 cohorts, Supplement) and identified as positive based on a variety of EUA testing methods performed by a number of different labs. Given the potential for variability in RT-PCR performance given the use of numerous tests by multiple labs, samples were categorized by days since symptom onset (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b2">
<title>NPA Study Cohorts</title>
<p>The primary NPA included 124 retrospective frozen clinical remnant blood samples collected prior to December 2019 (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and thus presumed negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These samples were collected over two years, during all months (including cold/flu season), and from diverse geographical areas in the United States (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 2.</label>
<caption><title>Description of SARS-CoV-2 negative samples for primary and secondary NPA</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="21249345v1_tbl2.tif"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>The secondary NPA study included blood samples from subjects enrolled prospectively (ImmuneSense COVID-19) from Oct-Nov 2020 who presented with SARS-CoV-2 symptoms but tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR EUA, BioFire RP V2.1, and EUA antibody tests (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Clinical Specimens</title>
<p>From all sources, whole blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes, frozen, and shipped to Adaptive for immunosequencing. Paired serum samples were tested using two different EUA antibody assays: 1) Elecsys&#x00AE; Anti-SARS-CoV-2; Roche (all isotypes); and 2) SARS-CoV-2 Antibody, IgG; LabCorp. Detailed serology assay information is in the Supplement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Classifier Development and Training</title>
<p>We have previously described the development of a SARS-CoV-2 classifier based on TCR&#x03B2; DNA sequences from blood samples<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Briefly, one-tailed Fisher&#x2019;s exact tests were performed on all unique TCR sequences comparing their presence in SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive samples (n=784) with negative controls (n=2,447) to generate a list of SARS-CoV-2-associated sequences which are exclusive to, or greatly enriched, in PCR-positive samples. These sequences were used to create a classifier by logistic regression with two dependent variables, the number of unique TCR&#x03B2; DNA sequences encoding a SARS-CoV-2-associated sequence and the total number of unique TCR&#x03B2; DNA sequences in the sample. The diagnostic model threshold is set to demonstrate 99.8&#x0025; specificity against a set of 1,657 held out negative controls not used in training<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>T-Detect COVID Assay</title>
<sec id="s2e1">
<title>Process Overview</title>
<p>The T-Detect COVID Assay consists of 1) a core assay designed to sequence and quantify rearranged TCR&#x03B2; sequences from gDNA extracted from peripheral blood and 2) diagnostic software, which applies a COVID-specific algorithm to the TCR&#x03B2; sequence repertoire data to determine a result. The system consists of reagents, instrumentation, software and instructions needed to perform the process steps as summarized in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig1" position="float" fig-type="figure">

<graphic xlink:href="21249345v1_fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e2">
<title>Sample Collection and Processing</title>
<p>Peripheral whole blood is collected in a 10mL EDTA vacutainer tube and shipped overnight at ambient temperature to the Adaptive clinical laboratory. Upon receipt it is accessioned and stored refrigerated at 4C until processed that same day via automated gDNA extraction or stored frozen at &#x2013;80C if extraction is at a later date.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e3">
<title>Sample and Library Preparation, Sequencing, and Pipeline Analysis</title>
<p>Detailed methods for sample preparation, immunosequencing, and pipeline analysis have been described previously<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Briefly, a target gDNA sample input of 18&#x00B5;gs is isolated from 2mL of fresh or frozen peripheral whole blood (6mL is requested). This target gDNA input ensures that samples achieve a minimum unique productive rearrangements (UPR) input QC specification. A multiplex PCR strategy with synthetic TCR&#x03B2; molecules added to each reaction is used to amplify rearranged TCR&#x03B2; sequences from gDNA. PCR libraries are loaded together on a single sequencing run and sequencing performed using the Illumina NextSeq 500/550 System. Sequence data are extracted and reads are attributed to data derived from biological vs. synthetic templates to derive template estimates for each identified receptor sequence as well as input cell counts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e4">
<title>T-Detect COVID algorithm</title>
<p>The COVID-specific algorithm (classifier) which was developed as described above and locked prior to initiating any of the T-Detect COVID validation studies is applied to the core assay output. The classifier identifies and quantifies any SARS-CoV-2-associated TCRs from a predetermined list of several thousand SARS-CoV-2-associated TCRs and also quantifies non-SARS-CoV-2 TCR sequences. These factors are mathematically combined into a score representing the relative enrichment for SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR sequences. This score is compared to a pre-specified threshold derived during algorithm training to classify the patient sample as positive or negative for an immune response to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="s3">
<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Public enhanced sequences associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection distinguish cases from controls</title>
<p>Initial development of the COVID classifier utilized public enhanced SARS-CoV-2 sequences from two cohorts, Discovery Life Science (DLS, from New York, USA) and NIH/NIAID (from Italy), comprising a total of 483 cases, with 1,798 controls collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. A total of 1,828 enhanced SARS-CoV-2 sequences were identified from this first dataset which collectively distinguish cases from controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Notably, these enhanced sequences were also substantially enriched in 397 cases from three additional held-out cohorts: ISB (Institute of Systems Biology&#x2019;s Covid-19 Immune Response Study; Seattle, WA), H12O = (Hospital 12 de Octubre; Madrid, Spain), and BWNW = (Bloodworks Northwest; Seattle, WA) but not seen at the same elevated rates in 1,702 additional held-out controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>).</p>

<p>As additional data enabled identification of more SARS-CoV-2 associated TCRs to improve performance of the classifier<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, our final classifier was trained using 784 cases from all five cohorts referenced above (and in Supplemental Table 1), as well as 2,447 controls. We then set the diagnostic model threshold to 99.8&#x0025; specificity on an independent set of 1,657 negative controls not used in training. The final classifier includes a total of 4,470 SARS-CoV-2 associated sequences. The classifier&#x2019;s performance appears robust to potential confounders such as age and sex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a,b</xref>), and its performance has been tested in several independent studies<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, suggesting equal or better sensitivity to antibody serology testing.</p>

<title>High Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) with SARS-CoV-2 PCR</title>
<p>Two separate positive percent agreement (PPA) studies were undertaken to evaluate T-Detect COVID Assay performance in subjects with confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR: a primary PPA analysis relative to days since diagnosis and a secondary PPA analysis relative to days from symptom onset. In the primary PPA study, 205/222 samples tested were from unique subjects and passed all QC and threshold requirements making them eligible for analysis. In the secondary PPA study, all 77 samples tested were from unique individuals, passed QC and threshold requirements, and were included for analysis.

<p>The biology of the T-cell mediated response to infection inherently requires specificity between the TCRs in SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples and the cognate antigens unique to SARS- CoV-2. The classifier development for this assay leveraged this biologic mechanism. The clinical call threshold was established by utilizing 1,657 controls/known negative samples collected in the U.S. prior to December 2019, from populations with a high prevalence of vaccination against, or infection with, potentially cross-reactive viruses.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of myriad diagnostic testing strategies and platforms. Despite the critical roles of both humoral and cellular immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery, serologic testing is the predominant means of assessing previous infection, population-level prevalence and incidence, and potential immunity. Serology tests offer advantages of relatively low cost, fast turnaround time, and scalability; at the time of this publication, over 100 SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests are available for clinical use including over 60 with EUA status<sup><xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. However, the limitations of serologic testing, including high variability in test performance across platforms and antibody isotypes tested<sup><xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, waning or loss of antibody signal over time<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, and absence of detectable antibodies in up to 10&#x0025; of individuals including those with immunocompromising conditions<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, expose unmet clinical and public health needs for immunologic testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 that are consistent, durable, and more informative.</p>
<p>Using TCR gene sequencing from whole blood samples, we describe a sequence-based assay to identify recent or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection which demonstrates high PPA (&#x003E;97&#x0025; beyond 15 days following diagnosis), high NPA in presumed or confirmed negative SARS-CoV-2 infection (&#x223C;100&#x0025;), equivalent or higher PPA compared to commercially available EUA serology tests, and lack of cross reactivity with a number of viral and/or respiratory tract pathogens. This performance was consistent across several retrospective and prospective cohorts and longitudinal sampling timeframes. Utilizing this approach in a real-world setting, we have shown previously that robust T-cell signals are persistent at least 6 months after primary SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup><xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, consistent with other reports<sup><xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. In the SARS-CoV-1 pandemic, detectable virus-specific T-cell responses were observed in recovered individuals up to 17 years later<sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. In direct real-world comparisons with serologic testing, we have observed up to a 20&#x0025; lower sensitivity of commercially available antibody tests in identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to T-Detect COVID, with greater reductions in serology performance occurring at later timepoints following infection<sup><xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Finally, we have reported a direct correlation between the magnitude of the measured SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response (in depth and breadth) and prior disease severity<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>These observations support the potential clinical utility of T-cell profiling in the COVID-19 pandemic as a means of risk stratification of disease progression and outcomes, detection of remote prior infection, informing public health and surveillance strategies, and clarifying the correlates of immune protection by providing a more comprehensive characterization of the immune response. We have previously applied our statistical classification framework based on immunosequencing data and T-cell repertoire profiling in determining CMV serostatus as a proof of principle<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The generation, validation, and application of different algorithms to immunosequencing data has the potential to yield clinical insights across multiple disease areas, particularly in infectious diseases and autoimmunity.</p>
<p>Robust T-cell profiling can also inform vaccine development. Vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 are capable of inducing type 1 helper T-cell (Th1) responses, in addition to high levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies that decline over time<sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Indeed, Th1-skewed responses have been shown to drive protective humoral and T-cell responses in patients receiving vaccines directed against other viruses<sup><xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Thus, a combination of serological testing and high-throughput T-cell repertoire profiling could be beneficial for fully characterizing the nature of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, including assessment of the T-cell response and potential immune escape in recently-described viral variants that have evidence for increased infectivity and transmission<sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, understanding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for elucidating the etiology of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 and inflammatory sequelae. Recent data suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 may develop autoantibodies that target proteins involved in the humoral or cellular response, resulting in decreased levels of B cells or T cells<sup><xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Similarities to Kawasaki&#x2019;s disease have led some to propose that multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and in adults (MIS-A), rare complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, may result from aberrant T- or B-cell responses to the virus<sup><xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. A subset of patients with COVID-19 also present with cardiomyopathy, viral myocarditis or one of a spectrum of syndromic features associated with &#x201C;long COVID,&#x201D; all of which have been linked to immune dysfunction<sup><xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. Comprehensive, high-throughput methods of interrogating the cellular immune response in these conditions can provide important clinical insights.</p>
<p>We acknowledge several study limitations, including small samples sizes in some cohorts tested (&#x003C;15 days post-symptom onset), very limited data from pediatric cohorts (&#x003C;18yo), and the lack of availability of other seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV) samples for cross-reactivity testing. For the latter, we made extensive efforts to locate retrospective samples for subjects with common respiratory infections but were unsuccessful as blood is not commonly drawn in the clinical diagnosis or treatment of these respiratory viruses. Importantly, there is a high reported prevalence of antibodies against each of the four HCoVs, with greater than 98&#x0025; of individuals displaying antibodies against 3 of the 4 common strains<sup><xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, a significant number of our controls would be expected to have immune responses against HCoVs, adding confidence to the specificity of our TCR signal.</p>
<p>Diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine development for COVID-19 have proceeded at unprecedented speed and scale. T-Detect COVID is the first TCR sequencing-based assay for interrogation of the cellular immune response in SARS-CoV-2, which demonstrates &#x2265;95&#x0025; positive agreement in identifying prior exposure/infection with &#x223C;100&#x0025; negative agreement and equivalent or higher performance than commercial EUA serologic testing. As such, it can provide critical insights into disease pathogenesis, severity, recovery, and protection. Future studies will help establish the merits of this approach for immunology research, vaccine/drug development, and public health/surveillance strategies.</p>

<title>Detailed Study Protocol Information</title>
<p>All samples were collected pursuant to an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved clinical study protocol, &#x201C;ImmuneSense&#x2122; COVID-19 Study&#x201D; (PRO-00781/ADAP- 007/WIRB#20202820/NCT04583982.) Residual samples collected under prospective study protocols obtained informed consent from participants under a separate protocol: &#x201C;ImmuneRACE&#x201D; (ADAP-006/WIRB# 20200625/NCT04494893). All other samples from cohorts described were collected as clinical remnant samples.</p>

<title>Detailed Methods</title>
<sec id="s5b1">
<title>Description of cohorts used for secondary analyses</title>
<p>The ImmuneRACE study is a prospective, multi-cohort, exploratory study of participants exposed to, infected with, or recovering from COVID-19 (NCT04494893). Participants from across the United States were consented and enrolled via a virtual study design, with cohorting based on participant-reported clinical history following the completion of both a screening survey and study questionnaire. Whole blood, serum, and a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab were collected from participants by trained mobile phlebotomists. Participants with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 test were included as residual, retrospective samples in the CV study.</p>
<p>The ImmuneSense&#x2122; COVID-19 Study&#x2019;s prospective study arm enrolled individuals with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 who were being tested for SARS-CoV-2 at two drive-thru testing sites in New Jersey. Whole blood, serum, and a nasopharyngeal swab were collected from participants at study sites. An electronic questionnaire was administered by study staff. Individuals testing positive via Abbot&#x2019;s RT PCR were included in the secondary PPA analysis. Individuals testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR EUA, BioFire RP V2.1, and EUA antibody tests were included in the NPA analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5b2">
<title>Clinical Specimens</title>
<p>From all sources, whole blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes, frozen, and shipped to Adaptive for immunosequencing. When paired serum samples were collected, they were tested using two different EUA antibody assays: 1) Elecsys&#x00AE; AntiSARS-CoV-2; Roche: qualitative detection of high affinity antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 including all isotypes, but preferentially detects IgG antibodies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.labcorp.com/tests/164068/sars-cov-2-antibodies">https://www.labcorp.com/tests/164068/sars-cov-2-antibodies</ext-link>); and 2) SARS-CoV-2 Antibody, IgG; LabCorp: qualitative detection of IgG antibodies to SARSCoV-2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.labcorp.com/tests/164055/sars-cov-2-antibody-igg">https://www.labcorp.com/tests/164055/sars-cov-2-antibody-igg</ext-link>).</p>
