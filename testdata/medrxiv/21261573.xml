<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Breast cancer is a kind of cancers with the higher incident rate in women in the world. The latest statistics showed that nearly 1.5 million women suffered from breast cancer every year, accounting for 25&#x0025;-30&#x0025; of all malignant tumors in women. Incidence rate of breast cancer has been increasing year by year with the improvement of living standard and lifestyle and the deterioration of living environment in China<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]</sup>. Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, and there are great differences in tissue morphology, molecular phenotypes, clinical manifestations, therapeutic effects and prognosis<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a kind of subtype of breast cancer with negative estrogen receptor (ER), negative progesterone receptor (PR) and negative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). accounting for 15&#x223C;20&#x0025; in all breast cancer types<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]</sup>. It has the characteristics of poor tumor differentiation, strong invasiveness, easy local recurrence and distant metastasis<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]</sup>. The effective treatment methods are mainly chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and it is often insensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The present study found that TNBC is a group of tumors with different biological behavior. There are obvious differences in molecular biological characteristics, clinical manifestations and prognosis, and can be divided into more different subtypes<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>BRCA1 gene is located in human 17q21 with a length of about 100kb, including 24 exons and 22 introns, there are 22 exons with transcription and coding functions, and finally encode into phosphorylated protein containing 1863 amino acids, which plays a role in DNA damage repair, homologous recombination, cell cycle regulation, transcriptional activation and inhibition and centrosome replication<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]</sup>. BRCA1 gene is the most common susceptibility gene for breast cancer. The proportion of breast cancer with BRCA1 mutation in the lifetime is as high as 60&#x0025;&#x223C;80&#x0025;, and the onset age is more than 20 years earlier than that of the general population<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]</sup>. A large number of studies have shown that the proportion of TNBC in BRCA1 mutation carriers is higher, and often shows large size, poor differentiation, strong invasion, and easy to have local recurrence and distant metastasis; more than 30&#x0025; of the TNBC are associated with mutations in the BRCA1 gene<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated and analyzed the clinical features of TNBC patients in Beijing, compared the difference between (recurrence and metastasis) group and non-(recurrence and metastasis) group in age distribution, family history of breast cancer, pathological type, histological grade, clinical stage, vascular tumor thrombus, tumor size and lymph node metastasis and the expression of 15 BRCA1 gene SNP loci, which may provide some clues for clinic staff for TNBC treatment in Beijing.</p>

<title>Investigation subject</title>
<p>The investigation subjects in this study were TNBC breast cancer patients who were admitted to the Cancer Hospital of China Academy of Medical Sciences in the past 5 years. There were a total of 280 breast cancer patients, They were Han population of China, had complete demographic data, clinical pathological data and follow-up data. The patients in the study were divided into (recurrence and metastasis) group and non-(recurrence and metastasis) group according to whether there was recurrence or metastasis. Usually according to the criterion, patients who had no local recurrence or distant metastasis for more than 3 years from diagnosis to enrollment were considered there was no recurrence and metastasis.</p>
<p>All the patients in the study were diagnosed as TNBC patients, when expression of ER, PR and HER2 were negative considered as TNBC patients. The expression of ER and PR was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), The expression of HER-2 was determined by IHC or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). When the positive ratio &#x003C;10&#x0025; in breast cancer cells considered ER negative and PR negative, the criteria for HER2 negative were immunohistochemical staining (-)/(&#x002B;) or fluorescence in situ hybridization without amplification.</p>
<p>All enrolled patients were followed up for a long time by consulting the original medical records, outpatient reexamination and telephone follow-up, and the tumor recurrence, metastasis and survival of enrolled patients were recorded in detail.</p>

<title>Investigation methods</title>
<p>TNBC breast cancer patients were classified according to age distribution, family history of breast cancer, pathological type, histological grade, clinical stage, vascular tumor thrombus, tumor size and lymph node metastasis and the expression of 15 BRCA1 gene SNP loci, and compared the difference between (recurrence and metastasis) group and non-(recurrence and metastasis) group.</p>
<p>For BRCA1 gene SNP determination, firstly BRCA1 gene was retrieved from the SNP public database provided and the human genome genetic variation integration map published by the thousand people genome project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>), all SNP loci related to the known BRCA1 gene information in the Chinese Han population were selected, combined with the statistical characteristics of minimum allele frequency (MAF) and Hardy Weinberg equilibrium <italic>p</italic> value (HWPval), the above candidate SNP sites were screened to obtain the best labeled SNP. Selection requirements was MAF&#x003E;0.1 and HWPval&#x003E;0.1. Then the labeled SNP sites were replaced and supplemented according to the location of SNP sites (missense mutation sites in exon region, UTR region, promoter region and intron region were usually selected, and synonymous mutation was not selected) and the positive SNP sites related to BRCA1 gene reported in the literature at home and abroad. Finally, sequence primers were designed for the selected loci by software. Considered the interaction between different primers, 15 SNP loci were selected finally. The specific information of SNP loci of BRCA1 gene is shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>TNBC has the poor prognosis and worse survival, endocrine therapy and targeted therapy is ineffective for TNBC treatment; the effective treatment methods are mainly chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but they are often insensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]</sup>, therefore, it is of important clinical significance to understand the clinical characteristics and pathogenesis of TNBC patients for local oncologist. In this study, we collected and analyzed the clinical data of a total 280 case of TNBC patients which admitted to the oncology hospital of China Academy of Medical Sciences. There were 85 cases TNBC patients aged under 40 years old, and 195 cases TNBC patients aged above 40 years old, accounting for 30.36&#x0025; and 69.64&#x0025; in total TNBC breast cancer patients respectively, patients there were 117 cases breast cancer patients occurred recurrence and metastasis, accounting for 41.79&#x0025; in total 280 cases breast cancer patients with TNBC in Beijing area; clinical stage, vascular tumor thrombus, tumor size and lymph node metastasis in (recurrence and metastasis) group were significantly different from their in non-(recurrence and metastasis) group, those data demonstrated that the age of TNBC were 40 years old, and there were the higher recurrence and metastasis in TNBC patients in Beijing area.</p>
<p>And then we detected and analyzed expression of 15 BRCA1 gene SNP loci in (recurrence and metastasis) group and non-(recurrence and metastasis) group, found that there were many difference in several SNP loci, but the frequencies of genotypes in the (recurrence and metastasis) group and non-(recurrence and metastasis) group were similar, there was no statistical significant correlation between the SNP genotype of the BRCA1 gene and the recurrence and metastasis risk of TNBC (P&#x003E;0.05). Those data demonstrated that the BRCA1 gene SNP loci in TNBC patients expression of BRCA1 gene in different TNBC patients, and the mechanism of TNBC was genetic variation, recurrence and metastasis of negative breast cancer is relatively complicated.</p>
