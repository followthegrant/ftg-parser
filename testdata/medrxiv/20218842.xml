<title>Abstract</title>
<p>COVID-19 has more severely impacted socioeconomically (SES) disadvantaged populations. Lack of SES measurements and inaccurately identifying high-risk locales can hamper COVID-19 mitigation efforts. Using South Korean COVID-19 incidence data (January 20 through July 1, 2020) and established social theoretical approaches, we identified COVID-19-specific SES factors. Principal component analysis created composite indexes for each SES factor, while Geographically Weighted Negative Binomial Regressions mapped a continuous surface of COVID-19 risk for South Korea. High area morbidity, risky health behaviors, crowding, and population mobility elevated area risk for COVID-19, while improved social distancing, healthcare access, and education decreased it. Our results indicated that falling SES-related COVID-19 risks and spatial shift patterns over three consecutive time periods reflected the implementation of reportedly effective public health interventions. While validating earlier studies, this study introduced a methodological blueprint for precision targeting of high-risk locales that is globally applicable for COVID-19 and future pandemics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>COVID-19 corroborated insights gained from SARS, H1N1 influenza, and MERS pandemics that more severely affect socioeconomically (SES)-disadvantaged populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Area-health and SES lead to differential incidence and mortality as they define the disease agent exposure extent, susceptibility to contracting disease once exposed, and disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Although existing studies provided COVID-19 risk factors, none identified COVID-19-vulnerable locales associated with SES factors with acceptable generalizability and methodological capacity.</p>
<p>Current studies use isolated arbitrary SES variables based on researchers&#x2019; preferences. These lack conceptual clarity, and thereby fail to truly uncover how SES affects health outcomes. Consequently, a lack of harmony (reduced external validity) exists among the studies conducted across national and sub-national settings. This lack impedes rapid response and effective control measures, especially for developing countries relying on resource-rich countries for guidance. To address this, we integrated Coleman&#x2019;s Social Theory and Blumenshine&#x2019;s mechanistic framework (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), which permits a universal SES definition and SES indicator selection mechanistically/causally relevant to the health outcome.</p>

<p>Subscripts (i, j, k): Number of variables used from the data sources. Data sources: Korean Community Health Survey by the KCDC, Health Insurance Statistics by the National Health Insurance Services, Disability Status by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Death Cause Statistics by the National Statistics Agency, Korean Census Bureau, Internal Migration Statistics by the Statistics Korea, and the State of Urban Planning Report by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism. &#x002A;Material, Human and Social Capital refers to latent structural components of the area health and SES determinants Health and SES connected by arrows indicate the integration of area health and SES as a composite exposure in this study, hereinafter, denoted as a health/SE. &#x25A1; Area-health/SE themes identified relevant to COVID-19 based on the person and population-level literature.

</fig>
<p>SES data span an expanse of highly intercorrelated variables such as <italic>healthcare utility rate, insurance coverage rate</italic>, and <italic>unmet healthcare needs</italic>, each used interchangeably as a healthcare access measure. A composite measure approach can summarize the multi-dimensional information of individual SES variables, while addressing the inadequacy of traditional statistics in simultaneously handling multiple highly intercorrelated variables. A commonly-used index, area-deprivation index (ADI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, can adjust models to SES as a confounder, but not when SES is the exposure. Since disease risk is determined by multiple SES factors, understanding SES-related disease risk requires SES concept-specific data. Therefore, we recommend causally-important multiple composite indexes, as these allow researchers to delineate the mechanism through which SES theme(s) increase the COVID-19 risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus far, only one study explored geographic methodology with a multi-scale Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) accounting for selected SES variables (median household income, income inequality, percentage of nurse practitioners, and black female population) in the US<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Since multi-scale GWR doesn&#x2019;t fit a beta distribution typical for infectious disease rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, we recommend Geographically Weighted Negative Binomial Regression (GWNBR) to improve accuracy. This directly takes discrete count data without further transformation, and is robust to overdispersion, spatial/temporal clustering and false-positives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in waves with country-specific mitigation strategies producing sharp declines. We chose South Korean COVID-19 incidence data because it presented extremely high overdispersion and spatial clustering, being more complex than typical infectious disease data. South Korea, as a real extreme case scenario, allowed us to check our framework&#x2019;s functionality. Our study&#x2019;s goals were to 1) provide methodological guidance for identifying COVID-19-vulnerable locales associated with SES factors; and 2) operationalize a framework using South Korean data to demonstrate its value and in the interpretation of the results.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Study design and population</title>
<p>We used COVID-19 incidence data from January 20 through July 1, 2020, released from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and prepared by the DS4C project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Analytical data consisted of 11 811 COVID-19 cases aggregated by 250 districts (Table S1) aligned to SAS&#x2019;s South Korean geographic matrix. Since data was unavailable for Daegu&#x2019;s subparts, we estimated the incidence from KCDC&#x2019;s press release cluster reports.</p>

<title>Conceptual model</title>
<p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the Coleman-Blumenshine Framework (CBF) refined approach, based on Coleman&#x2019;s Social Theory and Blumenshine&#x2019;s mechanistic framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The model defines SES as a function of social and human capitals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and emphasizes pathways by how SES indicators differentially increase SARS-CoV-2 exposure and susceptibility to developing COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Based on the CBF model and COVID-19 risk factors literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, we identified seven area-level health and SES factors that determined the SARS-CoV-2 exposure level and the likelihood of developing COVID-19 after exposure.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>SES measurement</title>
<p>All SES related data sources were retrieved from the Korean Statistical Information Service&#x2019;s (KOSIS) online data archive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Table S3 presents the reviewed data sources used for SES measurement. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows 24 data items out of 124 candidates relevant to the seven health/SE areas. We used an independent variable proxy for <italic>education</italic>, and by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) created six thematic composite indices: <italic>healthcare access, health behavior, crowding, area morbidity, education, difficulty to social distancing</italic>, and <italic>population mobility</italic>. Factors were computed as linear combinations of the original variables selected for each health/SE theme. We used the first component scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> in calculating the composite scores since they explained the largest data variation. Then we computed each variable&#x2019;s weight by dividing each factor score by the sum of all variable factor scores as:</p>

where <italic>i</italic> relates to each theme&#x2019;s variable and <italic>p</italic> is the number of each theme&#x2019;s variables. Each thematic composite index was computed as the weighted average for all 250 district values. For example, the composite index for <italic>health behavior</italic> was calculated as:

Six thematic composite indices and an individual proxy for education (percentage of high school educated people) were used in the final models as independent variables.</p>
<p>The ratio of the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile and each theme&#x2019;s maximum value was for <italic>healthcare access</italic>: 2.5; <italic>health behavior</italic>: 1.2; <italic>crowding</italic>: 1.9; <italic>area morbidity</italic>: 1.3; <italic>education</italic>: 1.5; <italic>difficulty to social distancing</italic>: 3.0; and <italic>population mobility</italic>: 10.3.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Our model outcome was the confirmed case counts of COVID-19 aggregated by 250 districts. Global negative binomial regression (GNBR) and GWNBR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> computed relative risk of COVID-19 associated seven area health/SE themes.</p>

<title>Local spatial models</title>
<p>We used Gaussian GWNBR to model a discrete count data and handle overdispersion issue. GWNBR computed parameter estimates for all districts following:

</table-wrap>
<p>We implemented separate global and local spatial models for the early, middle, and late pandemic phases. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> presents the relative COVID-19 risk with its 95&#x0025; CI from GNBR models, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, the relative risk spatial distribution from GWNBR associated with seven thematic areas by pandemic phases. Supplementary Table S4 provides more details on the stratified GNBR models. GWNBR fit data better than the global model given smaller AIC for the middle and late phases, respectively, (AIC<sub>gwnbr</sub> &#x223C;1034 vs AIC<sub>gnbr</sub>&#x223C;1044, AIC<sub>gwnbr</sub> &#x223C;1038 vs. AIC<sub>gnbr</sub>&#x223C;1074) except for the early phase of the pandemic (AIC<sub>gwnbr</sub> &#x223C;3533 vs AIC<sub>gnbr</sub>&#x223C;1527). This reflects the large spatial case cluster emerging from Daegu during the early phase that subsequently spread to its neighboring districts. The GNBR and GWNBR model results agreed across all pandemic phases. In the early phase, lower <italic>healthcare access</italic> and <italic>education</italic>, and increased risky <italic>health behavior, area morbidity, difficulty to social distancing</italic>, and <italic>population mobility</italic> associated with higher COVID-19 risk. <italic>Crowding-associated</italic> risk was not significant in GNBR.

<p>Early phase maps showed elevated risk in noncontiguous districts, which may reflect virus transmission in the initially affected districts before spreading over expanded areas. Relative risks associated with healthcare access, health behavior, and crowding indices were significant in the early phase where each index varied in spatial coverage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In the middle phase, only healthcare access remained significant with a northwest (capital region) and southwest spatial shift from the south and east. In the late phase, the risk associated with these three factors became significant and concentrated around the capital region, Chungcheongbuk-do, and Jeollabuk-do provinces. The period and observed spatial pattern here are consistent with the second wave that emerged in Seoul and its surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Other health/SE themes were not significant risk factors in the late phase. <italic>Difficulty to social distancing</italic> increased COVID-19 risk in the capital and middle regions in the early phase which then shifted to the country&#x2019;s southeast part in the middle phase. <italic>Area morbidity</italic>-associated risk was concentrated in the western part which then gradually shifted north in the middle phase. <italic>Education-</italic>associated risk was higher in the west in the early phase until it shifted southwest in the middle phase. <italic>Population mobility</italic> elevated COVID-19 risk only in the early phase for South Korea&#x2019;s northern, easter, and western parts.</p>
<p>We investigated the correlations between all pairs of composite indices (Table S5). The largest Pearson&#x2019;s correlation coefficient was 0.603 between healthcare access and area morbidity. We verified no multicollinearity given that the model standard error of area morbidity was the smallest (0.0064) and healthcare access standard error was small (0.025) compared to the largest standard error, 0.09, associated with crowding. For comparison, GNBR and GWNBR models were carried out with the same variables and stratified by the same periods (NBR: <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, and GWNBR: <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). AIC and dispersion coefficients were used to compare the models&#x2019; performances in computing COVID-19 risk associated with multiple health/SE themes across the country.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>GWNBR created a continuous surface of relative COVID-19 risk for all 250 districts associated with area-health and socioeconomic determinants by the pandemic phases (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Our findings are consistent with individual and population-level studies that reported elevated COVID-19 risk associated with less <italic>healthcare access</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and <italic>education</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and more <italic>risky health behavior, crowding, specific comorbidities</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, <italic>difficulty to social distancing</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and <italic>population mobility</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Our study&#x2019;s high internal validity was shown since the GNBR and GWNBR results agreed except for <italic>crowding</italic> in the early phase.</p>
<p>Our approach captured significant spatial variation by pandemic phases for all themes, consistent with the reported pattern of COVID-19 distribution in the country. Since its first confirmed case on January 20th, 2020, South Korea experienced two major outbreak waves in Daegu and Seoul, and the surrounding Gyeonggi-do province, respectively, in February (early phase) and May 2020 (late phase). The country responded to the first wave with nationwide directives that included mass testing based on contact tracing, self-quarantine/isolation, strengthening medical centers for rapid diagnostics, emergency medical responses, and treatment aids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. These specific measures combined with high public adherence to the school and business closures, personal hygiene, and social distancing significantly dropped the case counts until the second wave erupted in May when businesses reopened<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>SES-related risk declined over the pandemic phases. Analysis stratified by periodic phases found that the initially high risk in the early period gradually decreased in strength and spatial coverage in the middle and late phases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> &#x0026; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The exceptions were health behavior and crowding-associated risk, which increased in the late phase. Reductions could be explained by the impact of effective control measures that lowered the risk associated with these determinants and/or a drop in an effective reproduction number (Re), as the number of infection-susceptible people decreased over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>Types of significant SES risk factors varied over the pandemic phases</italic>. In the early phase, all health/SE themes were significant risk factors. In the middle phase, all of the previous risk factors except for risky <italic>health behaviors, population mobility</italic>, and <italic>crowding</italic> were significant. In the late phase, only increased risky <italic>health behavior</italic>, increased <italic>crowding</italic> and reduced <italic>healthcare access</italic> remained significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence. The decrease in risk associated with risky <italic>health behaviors, population mobility</italic> and <italic>crowding</italic> in the middle phase could reflect the impact of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s declaration implementing active interventions for social distancing, community health education, testing with local contact tracing and screening center followed ups with quarantine and isolation during the first weeks of March. Notably, the late phase findings are consistent with the risk factors reported associated with the second wave in early May. During the late phase, South Korea experienced the culmination of strain in its struggling health system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> which may have led to reduced <italic>healthcare access</italic> as indicated by our findings. In addition, our findings may have captured behavioral fatigue at the population-scale as a response to the country&#x2019;s multiple quarantine period extensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. This was observed in other countries that likely were exacerbated by business re-openings in early May. The elevated risk associated with increased <italic>crowding</italic> occurred during the second wave of outbreak and happened in Seoul and its surroundings, the most crowded region of the country. In contrast, the elevated risk associated with decreased crowding in the early pandemic reflects the population density of the associated locales. The health behavior-associated increase in risk is consistent with reports showing increased risk with poor <italic>emotional health</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, <italic>smoking</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and <italic>obesity</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Lusignan et al.,2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> reported smoking was a protective factor; however, the authors warned that the proportion of current smokers in their study sample was low (11.4&#x0025;), resulting in a wide confidence interval of the reported odds ratio, 0.59 (0.42-0.83). This increases the uncertainty of this result. Increased COVID-19 risk among the people with lower education has been explained as a reduced <italic>awareness of disease risk</italic> and <italic>low-income</italic>. Thus, not being able to afford losing employment resulted in reduced exercise of protective measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>Spatial variation in the SES-related risk factors across the pandemic phases potentially reflect the geography-specific control measures and/or the differential public response to the measures</italic>. GWNBR models revealed the pandemic phase-specific spatial variation for all health/SE themes except for population mobility which was not significant beyond the early phase. This may indicate that the effectiveness of the control measures varied over time potentially due to the differential interventions or the public response across the municipal districts. Our findings may also indicate a dynamic change in population vulnerability throughout the pandemic &#x201C;a person not considered vulnerable at the outset of a pandemic can become vulnerable depending on the policy response&#x201D; as a <italic>Lancet</italic> editorial stated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The factors increasing our recommended framework&#x2019;s robustness include: 1) SES measurement and relationship conceptualization of the exposure (health/SE themes) and outcome (COVID-19 incidence) based on the refined conceptual framework; 2) joint use of conceptual and statistical modeling; 3) complementary use of global and local spatial statistics; and 4) stratified analysis by pandemic phases that enable us to capture the spatial variation over pandemic phases. However, this methodological framework relies on carefully collected country-specific data.</p>
<p>Biases due to differential testing rates country-wide are low since the testing was based on contact tracing, and government-supported (free). Our study is subject to ecological fallacy inherent to the study design. However, our empty hierarchical mixed model accounting for the individual and district-level data shows that 61&#x0025; of the COVID-19 incidence distribution variation was explained by the district-level factors, leaving 39&#x0025; of the variability for explanation by individual factors. We verified that the data estimation for Daegu city subparts did not affect the study results significantly. The comparison of the intercept, standard error, relative risk and P-value between the models with and without the estimated data showed that the intercept and standard error were diminished by 2.2&#x0025; and by 9.2&#x0025;, respectively in the models including estimated data [each calculated by 100 (&#x2212;12,29 -(&#x2212;12.56))/-12.29 and 100 (1.88-2.95)/1.88, respectively]. A significance level change was observed for none of the model estimates, except for <italic>crowding</italic>. The P-value changed from &#x223C;0.06 to &#x223C;0.04 when the estimated data were excluded. However, the <italic>crowding-associated</italic> risk remains significant at P = 0.1. Model details are provided in Table S2. To assess the periodic trend in the relative COVID-19 risk associated with SES factors, we conducted stratified analyses by the early, middle, and late phases corresponding with January 20-March 20, March 21-April 15, and April 16-July 1, 2020.</p>
<p>We intended this framework to improve international knowledge exchange and enable rapid pandemic responses in high-risk populations. To illustrate practical application of this framework in South Korea, decision-makers could have prioritized improved healthcare access and promoted protective health behaviors focusing more on the crowded areas in the capital and surrounding regions in the second wave of the pandemic. Such precision targeting can bolster preventive measures to reduce the healthcare burden and economic damage.</p>
