<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Global electrical heterogeneity (GEH) is associated with sudden cardiac death in the general population. The association between GEH and sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) leading to appropriate ICD therapies in systolic heart failure patients with primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) is unclear.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study. GEH parameters including spatial ventricular gradient (SVG) direction and magnitude, QRS-T angle, and sum absolute QRST integral were measured on 12-lead ECGs prior to primary prevention ICD implantation. Multiple imputations using chained equations were employed to address missingness. Survival analysis using cause-specific hazard functions compared the strength of associations with two competing outcomes: sustained VT/VF leading to appropriate ICD therapies and all-cause mortality without appropriate ICD therapies.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We analyzed data from 2,668 patients (age 63&#x00B1;12y; 23&#x0025; female; 78&#x0025; white; 43&#x0025; nonischemic cardiomyopathy; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 28&#x00B1;11&#x0025; from 6 academic medical centers). After adjustment for demographic (age, sex, race, study center), clinical (LVEF, NYHA class, cardiomyopathy type, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, atrial fibrillation, renal function, medications), device (number of leads, manufacturer, ICD therapy programming), and traditional ECG characteristics, SVG elevation (Hazard Ratio (HR) per 1 standard deviation (SD) 1.14 (95&#x0025; CI 1.04-1.25); <italic>P</italic>=0.004), SVG azimuth (HR 1.12(1.01-1.24); <italic>P</italic>=0.039); SVG magnitude (HR per 1 SD 0.75 (0.66-0.85); <italic>P</italic>&#x003C;0.0001), and QRS-T angle (HR per 1 SD 1.21 (95&#x0025; CI 1.08-1.36); <italic>P</italic>=0.001) were associated with appropriate ICD therapies. The association of SVG azimuth with competing outcomes was distinctly different (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>dif</italic></sub>=0.007).</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In patients with primary prevention ICDs, SVG direction is independently associated with sustained VT/VF and appropriate ICD therapies, but not competing mortality.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patients with cardiomyopathy (CM) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are at elevated risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and in this population, current guidelines recommend consideration of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for primary prevention of SCD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. However, current guidelines for implantation of primary prevention ICDs rely primarily on LVEF and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, which are overall poor predictors of ICD benefit, especially in patients with nonischemic CM (NICM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> As ICD implantation is associated with the cost to the medical system and risk to individual patients, improved methods of identifying patients most likely to benefit from primary prevention ICDs are needed.</p>
<p>Global electrical heterogeneity (GEH) is an emerging and promising electrocardiographic marker of SCD risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> GEH is a comprehensive characterization of the spatial ventricular gradient (SVG),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> including SVG vector direction (azimuth and elevation), magnitude, its scalar value, and spatial QRS-T angle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> It integrates static and dynamic alternations in ventricular repolarization and conduction, which have been linked to ventricular arrhythmias in studies from the bench to the bedside.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> Abnormal GEH is associated with SCD in the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> where it is explicitly associated with SCD over non-arrhythmic modes of death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, and an increased risk of drug-induced torsades-de-pointes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> The utility of assessing GEH for SCD risk stratification in CM patients with reduced LVEF who meet primary prevention ICD indications, however, is unknown. As GEH might be a useful way of identifying patients who are most (or least) likely to benefit from primary prevention ICD implantation, we conducted a novel retrospective multicenter cohort study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> to determine the associations between the clinical, device, traditional ECG, and GEH parameters with sustained ventricular arrhythmias requiring appropriate ICD therapies and competing mortality without appropriate ICD therapies.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>The study design and protocol has been previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> In brief, we conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study that included data from six academic medical centers in the United States: OHSU in Portland, OR, Veteran Administration Portland Healthcare System (Portland VA) in Portland, OR, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, MA, the University of Colorado (U Colorado) in Aurora, CO, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) in Los Angeles, CA, and Stanford University (Stanford U) in Palo Alto, CA. We included all patients above the age of 18 years with chronic systolic heart failure (HF) due to infarct-related cardiomyopathy and/or NICM, who underwent implantation of any ICD [including single chamber, dual-chamber, cardiac resynchronization defibrillator (CRT-D), or subcutaneous] for primary prevention of SCD between the years of 1996 and 2019, and had an available digital 12-lead ECG recording. Patients with inherited channelopathies and cardiomyopathies, congenital heart disease, and those with ICD implanted for secondary prevention were excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>ECG analysis: global electrical heterogeneity measurement</title>
<p>A digital 12-lead ECG recorded around the time of initial ICD implantation was collected (median 0 days (interquartile range 0-29 days). Raw, digital ECG signals were analyzed in the Tereshchenko laboratory at OHSU, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> At least two physician-investigators manually labeled each cardiac beat (SH, EB, LGT). The Kors transformation matrix was used to transform 12-lead ECGs into orthogonal XYZ vectorcardiograms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> The time-coherent global median beat was constructed using the dominant type of beat present in the ECG, and the origin point of the vectorcardiogram was identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> We included three categories of median beats: normal (N) median beats included normal sinus rhythm, atrial pacing, junctional rhythm, and ectopic atrial rhythm; ventricular pacing (VP) median beats included right ventricular or biventricular pacing; supraventricular (S) median beats included atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with a consistent QRS morphology. QT interval was corrected using Bazett, Fridericia, and Hodges equations. The presence of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) on 12-lead ECG was noted.</p>
<p>We constructed spatial peak and area QRS and T vectors as well as their vector sum (the spatial ventricular gradient (SVG)) and measured their magnitude, direction (azimuth (orientation in the XZ plane) and elevation (orientation in the XY plane)), and spatial QRS-T angles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Scalar approximations of the SVG were measured via the sum absolute QRST integral (SAIQRST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and by the QT integral on vector magnitude (VMQTi) lead.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> Quality control of automated ECG analysis was performed to verify appropriate beat identification and fiducial point annotation (KTH). Open-source MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) code for GEH measurement is provided at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://physionet.org/physiotools/geh">https://physionet.org/physiotools/geh</ext-link> &#x0026;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Tereshchenkolab/Origin">https://github.com/Tereshchenkolab/Origin</ext-link>.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Primary Competing Outcomes</title>
<p>The primary outcome was defined as the first sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia event (VT or VF) with appropriate ICD therapy (either anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) or shock). All-cause death without preceding appropriate ICD therapy served as the primary competing outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Clinical characteristics and ICD programming</title>
<p>Patients&#x2019; demographics, clinical history, and laboratory values at the pre-implant clinical evaluation were abstracted from the medical record. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> ICD detection parameters were obtained at the time of device implant or at the time of appropriate ICD therapies if they occurred during follow-up. To harmonize ICD therapies programming across different device manufacturers and generations, we comprised two ICD programming categories: (1) therapies delay (longer time or more intervals needed for VT/VF detection) and (2) historical (more aggressive) programming (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Normally distributed continuous variables were reported as means and standard deviation (SD). An unadjusted comparison of circular variables (spatial QRS-T angle, SVG azimuth, and SVG elevation) was performed using the Wheeler-Watson-Mardia test. Circular variables were reported as mean and 95&#x0025; confidence interval (CI). ANOVA (for normally distributed continuous variables) and Pearson&#x2019;s &#x03C7;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> test (for categorical variables) were used to compare ECG characteristics in patients with and without primary and competing outcomes. Unadjusted analyses were performed using the dataset with missing values.</p>
<p>As we conducted a retrospective study, the data contained missing values for reasons unrelated to the study itself. Missingness data for individual covariates are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>. The most likely reason for missing values (incomplete data in the medical record) was unrelated to the unobserved data but likely was dependent upon the observed data (e.g., ICD therapy), which is characteristic for data missing at random. Therefore, we employed multiple imputations using chained equations (MICE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, which does not require the multivariate normal assumption. Our study&#x2019;s investigation of data missingness showed an arbitrary pattern. Observations with missing primary outcomes were excluded. We used predictive mean matching with 20 nearest neighbors for continuous variables, logistic regression for binary variables, ordinal logistic regression for ordinal variables, and multinomial logistic regression for nominal variables with 66 imputations, exceeding the minimum required by the von Hippel method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Convergence was confirmed. Relative variance increase, fraction missing information, and relative efficiency were assessed for each multivariable model and confirmed acceptable.</p>
<p>After examining a normal quantile plot, we included QRS-T and SVG elevation angles in all adjusted statistical analyses without transformation because their distributions were nearly normal. The SVG azimuth angle is ranging from &#x2212;180&#x00B0; to &#x002B;180&#x00B0;. Thus, as recommended,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> we transformed SVG azimuth by doubling its value and then adding 360&#x00B0;.</p>
<p>As the risk of sustained VT/VF leading to appropriate ICD therapy competes with the risk of death without appropriate ICD therapy, we employed cause-specific hazards functions, estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. For a model with sustained VT/VF and appropriate ICD therapy outcome, all-cause death event was censored at the date of death if there was no documented sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia at any time since implant until death. Accordingly, for a model with death without preceding sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia with appropriate ICD therapy outcome, sustained VT/VF with appropriate ICD therapy event was censored at the arrhythmic event date. Alive and event-free patients were censored at the time of the last device follow-up.</p>
<p>We compared the strength of association of demographic, clinical, ECG, and device characteristics between the two competing outcomes (appropriate ICD therapies and all-cause death) by testing the null hypothesis that the coefficients for a given variable (<italic>b</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> and <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>) were the same across the two competing outcomes by calculating Z-scores:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="20248369v1_ueqn1.gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>s</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. is a standard error and determining their statistical significance.</p>
<p>To study an association of GEH with the primary competing outcomes, we constructed four models. All models (1-4) with GEH exposure variables were adjusted for the type of median beat, mean RR interval, presence of PVCs, and possible distortion of median beat by premature beats. Model 1 was adjusted for demographic characteristics (age, sex, race) and study center. Model 2 included model 1 variables with additional adjustment for known clinical risk factors of the primary competing outcomes [LVEF, NYHA class, CM type, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, atrial fibrillation, eGFR<sub>CKD-EPI</sub>, and medications (use of beta-blockers, ACEi/ARBs, and class 1 or III antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD)]. Model 3 contained all covariates included in model 2, and, in addition, device characteristics: device type (ICD or CRT-D), manufacturer, and programming (including VT and VF zone cutoffs). Model 4, in addition to model 3 variables, was adjusted for traditional ECG metrics: heart rate, QRS duration, and Hodges-corrected QT interval. To standardize comparisons, we expressed continuous variables per 1 SD.</p>
<p>To test the study findings&#x2019; robustness under missing at random assumption, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using an imputed dataset based on complete ECG data. The dataset without missing pre-implant ECG data included 2251 patients; 480 of them had sustained VT/VF with appropriate ICD therapy, and 401 died without appropriate ICD therapy.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using STATA MP 16.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). A <italic>P</italic> value &#x003C; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>After excluding the ineligible patient records and those with missing outcomes, our study population included 2,668 patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Clinical characteristics are shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Mean age was 63.1 &#x00B1; 13.0 years, 23.4&#x0025; of patients were female, 9.7&#x0025; of patients were African-Americans, 7.5&#x0025; were Hispanic, and 4.5&#x0025; were Asian. Approximately 51&#x0025; of patients had ischemic CM, 83&#x0025; were NYHA class II-III, 79&#x0025; were using the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)-modifying medications, and 85&#x0025; of patients were on beta-blockers. On average, renal function was normal (average eGFR 70 mL/min/1.73 m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>). Diabetes was present in 36&#x0025; of patients, and 34&#x0025; of patients had a history of atrial fibrillation. CRT-D devices were implanted in 36&#x0025; of patients.</p>

<p>Over a median retrospective follow-up of 4 years, 541 patients experienced sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia leading to appropriate ICD therapy [incidence rate 50.1 (95&#x0025; CI 46.0-54.5) per 1000 person-years], and 479 patients died without appropriate ICD therapy [incidence rate 44.0 (95&#x0025;CI 40.2-48.1) per 1000 person-years]. The average rate of appropriate ICD therapy was similar to the rate of death without appropriate ICD therapy: &#x223C; 5&#x0025; per year.</p>
<p>An average heart rate, QRS duration, and QTc were within the normal range (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Patients who died without appropriate ICD therapy had a higher heart rate than those who remained alive and event-free (P=0.030) and a longer QTc than those who developed sustained VT/VF and were treated with appropriate ICD therapy. Patients who received appropriate ICD therapies were more likely to have PVC recorded on 12-lead ECG, smaller SVG magnitude and SAIQRST, wider QRS-T angle, and SVG vector pointing more superiorly, in comparison to events-free patients (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>In minimally adjusted model 1 (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), male sex, black race, atrial fibrillation, use of AADs, history of MI and revascularization procedures, NYHA class III, and higher BUN were associated with increased risk of appropriate ICD therapies. In contrast, greater age, eGFR, and LVEF were associated with a lower risk of appropriate ICD therapies. Adjustment for cardiac disease substrate, risk factors (model 2), and device programming (model 3) explained the association of race, atrial fibrillation, MI and revascularization, NYHA class, and BUN with sustained VT/VF, which became non-significant. In fully adjusted analysis (model 4), only age, male sex, use of AADs, LVEF, and eGFR remained significantly associated with sustained VT/VF and appropriate ICD therapies (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>In minimally adjusted model 1, ICD device type and programming were significantly associated with sustained VT/VF and appropriate ICD therapies (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Adjustment for HF characteristics, risk factors, comorbidities, and traditional ECG metrics (models 2-4) did not change the strength of the association.

<title>Association of GEH with primary competing outcomes</title>
<p>In minimally adjusted analysis, the presence of PVCs and all GEH metrics were associated with sustained VT/VF and appropriate ICD therapies (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), although there were differences between area-based and peak-based measurements. However, the adjustment for known clinical risk factors and device characteristics explained that association for SAIQRST and VMQTi. Notably, after full adjustment in model 4 (including heart rate, QTc, and QRS duration), area and peak spatial QRS-T angle and SVG elevation, area SVG magnitude, and peak SVG azimuth were associated with appropriate ICD therapies (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In comparison, only resting heart rate, spatial QRS-T angle, and area SVG magnitude associated with competing mortality outcome. The strength of associations diminished from model 1 to model 4, suggesting confounding by the HF substrate (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<p>In minimally adjusted competing risk analysis, heart rate and QTc had significantly different cause-specific hazards associated with the two competing outcomes (<xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Supplemental Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>However, these differences were explained by differences in clinical risk factors. In adjusted models, QRS duration and corrected QT interval were not associated with either appropriate ICD therapies or total mortality. After adjustment, only PVCs and peak SVG azimuth had significantly different cause-specific hazards associated with two competing outcomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The presence of PVCs was associated with a 42&#x0025; higher risk of appropriate ICD therapies but did not associate with competing mortality risk. Each additional 1 SD increase in peak SVG azimuth (&#x002B;36&#x00B0;, backward) was associated with a 12&#x0025; increase in the hazard of appropriate ICD therapies and a 10&#x0025; reduction in the hazard of total mortality without appropriate ICD therapy. Accordingly, 1 SD reduction in peak SVG azimuth (&#x2212;36&#x00B0;, forward) was associated with a 12&#x0025; decrease in the hazard of appropriate ICD therapies and a 10&#x0025; increase in the risk of death without appropriate ICD therapy. Area SVG azimuth showed a U-shaped association with appropriate ICD therapy (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) but not competing death risk (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the spatial QRS-T angle and SVG magnitude were associated with both appropriate ICD therapy and death without appropriate ICD therapy. For each 1 SD (33&#x00B0;) increase in area QRS-T angle, we observed an &#x223C;20&#x0025; increase in the hazard of both outcomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Each additional 1 SD increase in area SVG magnitude (25 mV&#x002A;ms) was associated with a 25&#x0025; <italic>reduction</italic> in the hazard of appropriate ICD therapies and a 14&#x0025; <italic>reduction</italic> in the hazard of death without appropriate ICD therapy.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This large multicenter retrospective cohort study of novel risk factors for SCD had two important findings. First, in competing risk analysis, we showed an independent association of GEH with ventricular arrhythmias leading to appropriate ICD therapies. After adjusting for demographic, clinical, ECG, and device characteristics, SVG vector pointed to distinctly different directions in patients who developed sustained VT/VF rescued by appropriate ICD therapies (backward-upward, counterclockwise) versus those who died without ICD therapy (forward, clockwise). SVG magnitude and spatial QRS-T angle were associated with both competing outcomes.</p>
<p>Second, we showed significantly different strength of association of age, diabetes, use of beta-blockers and ACEIs, NYHA class, BUN, ICD device programming features and VT zone cutoff, and the presence of PVCs between the two competing outcomes (appropriate ICD therapies and all-cause death). There was no difference in the associations of sex, CM type, atrial fibrillation, AAD use, LVEF, eGFR, and ICD device type with both competing outcomes.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Differences in the risk factors of two competing outcomes</title>
<p>The importance of considering naturally competing outcomes in ICD patients is critically important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> However, very few studies conducted a formal comparison of the strengths of association of a risk factor with two competing outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> In our study of primary prevention ICD recipients, unsurprisingly, ICD therapy programming category and VT zone programming threshold were distinctly different attributes of the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia with appropriate ICD therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> After adjustment for HF characteristics, comorbidities, and management, each additional 15 bpm increase in VT zone threshold was associated with reducing the hazard of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and appropriate ICD therapies by 25&#x0025;. ICD therapy delay (NID VT &#x2265; 30/40 intervals or VT detection time &#x2265; 10 sec) reduced the hazard of appropriate ICD therapy by 58&#x0025;. Our results are consistent with the well-recognized fact that appropriate ICD therapies occur more frequently than SCD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and ICD programming determines whether patients receive unnecessary therapies for what would have been nonsustained VT with longer ICD detection times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>We observed that diabetes, BUN, NYHA class, and HF therapy (ACEIs, beta-blockers) were strongly associated with all-cause death without appropriate ICD therapies but <italic>did not</italic> associate with the primary arrhythmic outcome. These clinical characteristics are often perceived as risk factors of both outcomes. Observed differences in these clinical risk factors&#x2019; association with two competing outcomes should be considered in planning future clinical studies and developing SCD risk models.</p>
<p>Age was associated with both outcomes in distinctly different ways. After adjusting for confounders, for every 1 SD (13 years) increase in age, the hazard of death without preceding appropriate ICD therapy <italic>increased</italic> by 35&#x0025;, while the hazard of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia leading to appropriate ICD therapy <italic>decreased</italic> by 21&#x0025;. Age is a ubiquitous risk marker. It is well-recognized that many ICD recipients, despite having an ICD, often die secondary to progressive heart failure or other non-cardiac comorbidities that congregate with advanced age.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Similarities in the risk factors of two competing outcomes</title>
<p>Noticeably, a set of particular clinical risk factors (sex, type of CM, atrial fibrillation, use of AADs, LVEF, eGFR), and ICD type had similar associations with both outcomes, suggesting common or overlapping mechanisms. All of these risk factors are well-known, however, our study conducted a novel formal statistical comparison of the strengths of their associations with competing outcomes in primary prevention ICD recipients. Besides apparent ICD device failure to detect and treat life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, ICD is ineffective in clinical scenarios when ventricular tachyarrhythmias accompany an unsurvivable myocardial injury. Common mechanisms of two competing outcomes highlight challenges in selecting an ideal candidate for primary prevention ICD. On the other hand, targeting common mechanisms can be especially rewarding, resulting in a sizable reduction of cardiovascular mortality. Primary prevention of atrial fibrillation, HF, and kidney dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> can potentially reduce the risk of both competing outcomes and should be a focus of future investigations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Global electrical heterogeneity</title>
<p>Our study confirmed that after multivariable adjustment in competing risk analysis, there is an independent association between SVG direction and sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias leading to appropriate ICD therapies, but not competing death outcome. The SVG vector points towards the area of the myocardium with the shortest excited state,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and deviations from normal suggest the accumulation of a critical mass of abnormal electrical substrate, which might predispose to ventricular arrhythmias. Our results support the use of GEH, and specifically the orientation of the area SVG vector, as a marker of abnormal underlying electrophysiological substrate responsible for a propensity for sustained ventricular arrhythmias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Further studies of mechanisms behind SVG directions are warranted.</p>
<p>Notably, we observed that PVCs&#x2019; presence on 12-lead ECG was also associated with competing risk of appropriate ICD therapy, but not all-cause mortality. Cardiac memory developing in response to PVCs may affect GEH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> It is well known that PVCs are associated with the development or worsening of HF, as well as that PVCs can trigger life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Further studies of the interaction between an underlying arrhythmogenic substrate (manifesting by GEH) and PVCs (manifesting by cardiac memory development) are needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms, leading to novel therapies.</p>
<p>In contrast to SVG direction, which had significantly different cause-specific hazards associated with two competing outcomes, area SVG magnitude and spatial QRS-T angle had similar associations with both outcomes. Finding of QRS-T angle being associated with both competing outcomes is expected. Numerous previous studies showed an association of QRS-T angle with broadly defined cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Our results underscore the importance and added value of a comprehensive GEH concept, which includes measurement of SVG direction, in addition to the QRS-T angle.</p>
<p>Similarly to this study, in another primary prevention ICD study (PROSE-ICD),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> we observed that smaller SVG magnitude and SAIQRST were associated with increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias ICD therapies. In contrast, in the MADIT-II study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and the general population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> <italic>larger</italic> SAIQRST and SVG magnitude were associated with ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. Such discrepant results highlight the complexity of ECG amplitudes interpretation, which remains poorly understood. Observed differences could be only partially explained by racial/ethnic differences in patient populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> We speculate that another plausible explanation of such a discrepancy could be cardiac memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> In relatively healthy individuals, after the restoration of previously altered ventricular conduction, cardiac memory manifests by an increase in T and SAI QRST magnitudes. In contrast, in patients with preexistent ventricular remodeling due to CM, if ventricular conduction remains persistently altered, SAIQRST and SVG magnitudes diminish further.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> Future studies of GEH are needed to improve further our understanding of how these parameters are affected by different patient characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Statistical assessment of competing risks</title>
<p>In this study, we preferred to use cause-specific hazards rather than the analysis of subdistribution hazards because Fine and Gray&#x2019;s method is not valid for causal inference and can produce misleading results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> We used cause-specific hazard that removes an individual from the risk set when <italic>any</italic> type of event occurs. In contrast, the subdistribution hazard does not remove an individual from the risk set when a competing event occurs. Nonetheless, those who experience one competing event are no longer at risk of the other competing event. As a result, the Fine and Gray method does not isolate distinct causal effects on the competing risks but instead may confound them. The interpretation of Fine and Gray&#x2019;s method is challenging when outcomes are not rare (as in this study).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> On the other hand, cumulative incidence functions are useful for prediction, which we utilized in our previous study where we developed a GEH-based SCD competing risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>Our study&#x2019;s strengths include the large sample size and population drawn from a diverse group of medical centers from across the United States. However, because the study included only academic medical centers, the results may not apply to all patients with ICDs. Because of our study&#x2019;s retrospective nature, ICD programming was not standardized, and differences in ICD detection and treatment parameters could have influenced the results, although we attempted to correct this by including ICD programming in our multivariable models. There was no postmortem ICD interrogation data, and we cannot precisely determine if there were ventricular arrhythmias close to the time of death. Importantly, appropriate ICD therapy is a surrogate for SCD, as all ventricular arrhythmias treated by the ICD would not necessarily have led to cardiac arrest or SCD. As in any observational study, residual confounding cannot be completely eliminated.</p>
