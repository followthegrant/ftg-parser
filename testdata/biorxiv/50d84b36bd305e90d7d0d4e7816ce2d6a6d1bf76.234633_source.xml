Despite detailed characterization in model organisms, the analogous human structures remain a mystery. We have previously shown that when stimulated with BMP4, micropatterned colonies of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) self-organize to generate early embryonic germ layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref></sup>. Here we show that in the same type of colonies WNT signalling is sufficient to induce a PS, and WNT with ACTIVIN is sufficient to induce an organizer, as characterized by embryo-like sharp boundary formation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, and expression of the organizer specific transcription factor GSC. Moreover, when grafted into chick embryos, WNT and ACTIVIN treated human cells induce and contribute autonomously to a secondary axis while inducing neural fate in the host.

We have previously shown that when grown on geometrically confined disks hESCs respond to BMP4 by differentiating and self-organizing into concentric rings of embryonic germ layers: with ectoderm in the center, extra-embryonic tissue at the edge, and mesoderm and endoderm in between<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref></sup>.

The expression profile of COLLAGEN IV, which in mouse demarcates the basement membrane between the epiblast and the visceral endoderm and which breaks down as the PS progresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref></sup>, and the 3D organization of cells around this boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-8" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2D-H</xref>), was highly reminiscent of the morphological signature of a PS. Confirming the PS nature of these structures, we find evidence of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) with SNAIL expression and an E-CADHERIN (E-CAD) to N-CADHERIN (N-CAD) switch where the mesendodermal fates later establish themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-9" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-5" hwp:rel-id="F5">Supp. Fig. 2B</xref>).

We find that both WNT and WNT3A+ACTIVIN treatment results in co-expression of OTX2 and FOXA2 in the same micropattern region that expresses SOX17, this set of markers together being characteristic of anterior PS in mouse. However, as in the mouse, only the condition with the highest NODAL signalling, i.e. WNT3A+ACTIVIN, results in the expression of the organizer-specific marker GSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-10" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2J-K</xref>, and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-2" hwp:rel-id="F6">Supp. Fig. 3C</xref>). WNT3A+ACTIVIN also leads to the highest expression of key secreted inhibitors known to be produced by the organizer and its deriviatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref></sup>, such as CHORDIN, DKK1, CER1, LEFTY1, and LEFTY2, and it also leads to the highest expression of NODAL, which at later stages in mouse is also specific to the organizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-1" hwp:rel-id="F7">Supp. Fig. 4D</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-22">The induction of characteristic organizer markers, the emergence of a sharp COLLAGEN IV based morphological boundary dividing the PS and epiblast regions, and the induction of EMT all provide evidence in support of the induction of a human organizer in an early primitive streak by WNT3A+ACTIVIN treatment. However, as originally defined by the classic amphibian experiments, an organizer is determined functionally as a group of cells that can induce a secondary axis when grafted ectopically into host embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup>. In this context, the grafted cells should contribute directly to the ectopic axis (autonomously), and induce neural tissue in the cells of the host (non-autonomously). In order to test for the most stringent and functional definition of an organizer, we used an <italic toggle="yes">ex ovo</italic> cross-species transplantation strategy based on previous mammalian organizer studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref></sup>, grafting fluorescent reporter hESC micropatterns treated for 24 or 48 hours with WNT3A+ACTIVIN into the marginal zone of Early Chick (EC) culture embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref></sup> (stage HH 2 to 3+). We used 500μm diameter rather than 1000μm diameter micropatterns as these gave a purer population of GSC+ cells, and we grafted at 24 hours post-treatment as well as at 48 hours post-treatment as 24 hours is when GSC first becomes apparent and is also co-expressed with BRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-2" hwp:rel-id="F7">Supp. Fig. 4A-C</xref>). For the reporter line, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 generated RUES2-GLR (Germ Layer Reporter) cell line, as it encodes 3 separate fluorescent markers at the endogenous locations for each of the 3 germ layers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-1" hwp:rel-id="F8">Supp. Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6" hwp:id="xref-fig-9-1" hwp:rel-id="F9">6</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-23">We found that RUES2-GLR grafts survived, mingled with host cells, and induced and contributed to a secondary axis that became obvious between 24-48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-1" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3B-L</xref>). Both the live cell reporter and a human-specific nuclear antigen revealed that the human cells directly contributed to the ectopic axis autonomously and continued differentiating in their new location, contributing both BRA and SOX17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-2" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3H, L-M</xref>). This mirrors previous observations in mouse-to-mouse organizer grafting experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup>. Confocal cross-sectioning of these secondary axes often revealed self-organizing features directly resembling those found in the early chick and mouse embryo, for example correct layering of germ layers, and central elongated notochord-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3 N-R</xref> and Supp. Video 1). Analysis of molecular markers also established that the human cells induced neural tissue in the chick non-autonomously: SOX2 and SOX3 were ectopically induced in chick cells that surrounded the human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-4" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3E-G, I-K, S</xref>). Additional <italic toggle="yes">in situs</italic> and antibody staining for HOXB1, GBX2, and OTX2 established that the neural tissue was predominantly posterior in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-5" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3 T-V</xref>). Since in the mouse the early-gastrula-organizer (EGO) and late-streak node also does not induce anterior neural structures when grafted to another mouse embryo, this result suggests that our human organizer is closer to these organizer stages than to the mouse mid-gastrula-organizer (MGO) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref></sup>. As controls, RUES2-GLR grafts treated instead with WNT3A, WNT3A+SB, BMP4, or blank media showed less overall survival and never induced chick neural markers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-1-1" hwp:rel-id="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-2" hwp:rel-id="F8">Supp. Fig. 5A</xref>). Taken together with the morphological, cellular, and molecular evidence described above, this functional test in an embryonic environment provides the most stringent evidence for the induction of a human organizer.

The already established and registered RUES2 hESC line (NIHhESC-09-0013) was used as the parental line. In order to achieve three independent targeting events in the same line, we approached each gene sequentially, since the efficiencies of recombination were not high enough for simultaneous targeting. First, for SOX17 targeting, we generated an homology donor plasmid (pSOX17-HomDon) containing:
i) a left homology arm that contain 1kb sequence right upstream of the SOX17 stop codon,
ii) a P2A-H2B-tdTomato cassette,
iii) a floxed Neomycin selection cassette (loxP-PGK-Neo-pA-loxP) and iv) a right homology arm containing a 1kb sequenceimmediately downstream of the SOX17 stop codon. Note that, since the H2B-tdTomato will be separated from the SOX17 gene by a self-cleaving P2A peptide, the fluorescent reporter will not be fused to SOX17, and therefore it will only be a reporter of the activation of the SOX17 expression, as the two proteins may have different half-lives. We initially tried a direct fusion of the SOX17 and tdTomato, but the fusion made the protein not properly localize to the nucleus, and therefore we decided to use a self-cleaving strategy. All DNA fragments were amplified from pre-existing plasmids or genomic DNA using Q5 polymerase with the primers listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-4-1" hwp:rel-id="T4">Supplementary Table 3</xref>, and joined together using standard DNA ligation protocols. An sgRNA recognizing a sequence near the stop codon of the SOX17 gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS4" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-5-1" hwp:rel-id="T5">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) was cloned into a Cas9-nickase expression vector (pX335 from the Zhang lab, Addgene plasmid #42335). This plasmid, together with the pSOX17-HomDon plasmid, were nucleofected into RUES2 cells using a Nucleofector II instrument and Cell Line Nucleofector Kit L (Lonza). Geneticin (a Neomycin analog) was added to the cultures 5 days after nucleofection, and kept in for 7 more days, to ensure selection of correctly targeted clones. Colonies derived from single geneticin-resistant cells were picked and expanded for screening. PCR amplification and Sanger-sequencing were used to identify correctly heterozygously targeted clones, with no unwanted mutations in the SOX17-sgRNA target site, both in the targeted and in the untargeted alleles. Positive clones were also validated for karyotyping (G-banding). The top 4 potential off-target sites of the sgRNA were PCR amplified and Sanger sequenced to ensure no unwanted mutations were present. The pluripotency status and absence of differentiation of the clones were validated through immunofluorescence staining. Once a perfectly validated SOX17-tdTom clone was identified, its youngest freezedown was thawed to undergo BRA gene targeting. Targeting of BRA followed a similar strategy as SOX17, but containing a Puromycin resistance cassette. Colonies derived from single puromycin-resistant cells were screened and validated as with the previous SOX17 targeting. After a fully validated double-targeted clone (SOX17-tdTom and BRA-mCer) was identified, it underwent sequential SOX2 targeting. Contrary to the SOX17 and BRA cases, for SOX2 targeting a direct fusion of SOX2 and mCitrine protein was possible without affecting its localization or function, and therefore the SOX2-mCitrine reporter constitutes a faithful reporter of both the “on” and “off” expression rates. The SOX2 homology donor consisted of: i) a 1kb left homology arm, ii) an mCitrine-T2A-Blasticidin cassette, and iii) a 1kb right homology arm.

After 1 hour ROCK-inhibitor was removed and replaced with standard MEF-CM, supplemented with Pen/Strep (Life Technologies), and incubated overnight. The following morning the micropatterned coverslip was carefully removed from the dish and placed in a coverslip holder (CYTOOchambers from CYTOO), to which 1mL of MEF-CM+Pen/Strep+50ng/mL BMP4 was added to induce differentiation. Immediately after media addition, the holder was transferred to a spinning-disk confocal microscope (CellVoyager CV1000, Yokogawa), in which fluorescent images were acquired every 30 minutes for 2 days. Multichannel time-lapse movies were generated from the raw images using ImageJ analysis software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="supplementary-material" hwp:id="sec-13"><title hwp:id="title-19">SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE LEGENDS</title><fig id="figS1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F4" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-4-1 xref-fig-4-2 xref-fig-4-3"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;234633v1/FIGS1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F4</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">figS1</object-id><label>Supplemental Figure 1</label><caption hwp:id="caption-9"><title hwp:id="title-20">Controls for investigating hESC PS initiation hierarchy</title><p hwp:id="p-52">(a) Micropatterned colonies stimulated with IWP2, SB, or blank media, fixed and stained for germ layer molecular markers after 48hrs.</p><p hwp:id="p-53">(b) qPCR for BMP4 of unpatterened small colonies stimulated for 4hrs conditions arraigned on the x-axis.
