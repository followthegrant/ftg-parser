The sample consists of 800 children with problems in attention, learning and / memory, as identified by a health or educational professional, and 200 typically-developing children recruited from the same schools as those with difficulties. All children are completing assessments of cognition, including tests of phonological processing, short-term and working memory, attention, executive function and processing speed.

This group have problems that vary from difficulties in mastering language, reading and mathematics through to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and many children have multiple areas of difficulty. For most children who are struggling academically, additional support is provided through education services within the school setting. Others also receive specialist interventions through health services including CAMHS (for ADHD) and speech and language therapy services. The long-term economic and social outcomes of this common and highly heterogeneous group of struggling learners include low rates of employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">de Beer, Engels, Heerkens &amp; van der Klink, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">Parsons &amp; Bynner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Emerson &amp; Hatton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">Whitehurst &amp; Lonigan, 1998</xref>) and increased risks of mental health and behavioural problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Emerson &amp; Hatton, 2007</xref>). Understanding the underlying causes of these problems provides the key to advancing the development of targeted intervention and prevention strategies and ameliorating these adverse outcomes.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">The current study adopts a transdiagnostic approach to identifying the cognitive, behavioural, neural and genetic mechanisms underpinning learning difficulties. It moves away from investigating tightly-defined deficits related to highly specific developmental impairments of cognition towards studying multiple levels the mechanisms and dimensions of disorder in a heterogeneous population. This approach is strongly endorsed by the RDoC NIMH project, in which the primary focus to date has been on psychiatric conditions including mood disorders and psychoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">Cuthbert &amp; Insel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">Doherty &amp; Owen, 2014</xref>). It is now widely recognised as equally valuable for cognitive developmental disorders in which there are also high levels of comorbidity, high variability in symptoms for individuals with specific diagnoses and high-levels of cooccurrence of symptoms across different areas of learning difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Casey, Oliveri, &amp; Insel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">Sonuga-Barke &amp; Coghill, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">Zhao &amp; Castellanos, 2016</xref>). In putting aside singular diagnostic categories, the aim is to understand and characterise the (possibly multiple) dimensions of disorder at the level of the individual child, guiding effective choice of intervention.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Levels of comorbidity across different aspects of learning difficulties are high. Reading difficulties are estimated to co-occur up to 50% of the time with maths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">Moll, Kunze, Neugoff, Bruder &amp; Schulte-Korne, 2014</xref>) or language problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">McArthur, Hogben, Edwards, Heath &amp; Mengler, 2000</xref>).

The plan is to recruit a broad sample of children with problems of attention, learning and/or memory (CALM, n=800) and a school-matched group of children who are developing typically (TD, n=200). Recruitment of the CALM group began in 2014 and will be completed in the summer of 2018. These children have been recruited through health and education professionals supporting children who meet the inclusion criteria. Formal diagnoses are not required and no exclusions are made on the basis of comorbid psychiatric, psychological or physical health conditions. Exclusionary criteria are non-native English speakers, uncorrected sensory impairments and the confirmed presence of genetic or neurological conditions known to affect cognition. Recruitment of the TD group will be via schools attended by multiple children in the CALM group and will commence in autumn 2018.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">All children complete a broad set of assessments of cognitive abilities known to be impaired in children with learning difficulties including tests of phonological processing, STM and working memory, executive function, attention and fluid reasoning (IQ). They are also given a set of learning measures assessing maths, language and literacy skills. At the time of the clinic visit, children are offered an optional MRI brain scan and asked to provide an optional saliva DNA sample. Parents / carers complete multiple questionnaires about family history and the child’s behaviour, mental health and communication skills. The breath of the recruitment criteria, the scale of the study and the multiple levels of assessment across behaviour, cognition, the brain, and genes make this study a unique resource for understanding the mechanisms of learning difficulties in childhood. The dataset will be made open to the scientific community within 6 months of the completion of data collection and cleaning. We anticipate that this will be in 2020.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-5"><title hwp:id="title-6">Aims and hypotheses</title><p hwp:id="p-11">The primary aim is to use data-driven, hypothesis-free methods to identify dimensions that characterise children based on cognition, behaviour and brain. Adopting a systems neuroscience approach, we will map between these different levels of explanation. Secondary aims are to define groups of children with common cognitive, neural and behavioural profiles and mapping dimensions and data-defined groups against traditional diagnostic categories.</p><p hwp:id="p-12">DNA samples will allow us to extend the dimensional analyses to the genetic level. This will be achieved primarily through participation in genetic consortia combining genotype data from developmental cohorts for genome-wide screening of speech, language and reading skills. Existing gene expression data (<ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="http://www.brain-map.org/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brain-map.org/" hwp:id="ext-link-2">http://www.brain-map.org/</ext-link>) will be combined with neural data from the CALM sample to identify broad gene groups whose regional expression profile matches important brain organizational features within the sample. These will be used to derive polygenic risk scores to explore how underlying genetic mechanisms might relate to differences in brain organization and in turn be associated with specific patterns of cognitive impairment.</p><p hwp:id="p-13">Although the primary statistical approach to be adopted in the study is hypothesis-free, the dataset will provide rich opportunities to test theories of development and disorder, as the following two examples show. First, the large sample of children at educational risk provide high levels of power that can be used to tease apart the cognitive pathways that contribute to different aspects of academic learning. For example, the data can distinguish whether working memory plays a unique role in supporting learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Gathercole &amp; Alloway, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Gathercole, Alloway, Kirkwood, Elliott, Holmes &amp; Hilton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">Swanson &amp; Sasche-Lee, 2001</xref>) or instead that its links with academic achievement are mediated by core domain-specific skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Cain, Oakhill &amp; Bryant, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">Nation, Adams, Bowyer-Crane &amp; Snowling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">Szucs et al., 2013</xref>). Second, data collected from the CALM group include substantial numbers of children both with and without ADHD who have learning difficulties. This will enable us to test whether in the children with ADHD, the learning problems have the same cognitive origins as the children with no ADHD or are at least in part are the disruptive consequences of the hyperactive and impulsive behavior distinguishing this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">Sonuga-Barke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">McGrath et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" hwp:id="sec-6"><title hwp:id="title-7">Methods and design</title><sec id="s3a" hwp:id="sec-7"><title hwp:id="title-8">Approval</title><p hwp:id="p-14">Ethical approval was granted by the National Health Service (NHS) Health Research Authority NRES Committee East of England, REC approval reference 13/EE/0157, IRAS 127675.</p></sec><sec id="s3b" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-9">Design</title><p hwp:id="p-15">This is a cohort study collecting individual differences measures of cognition and behaviour alongside MRI and DNA data.</p></sec><sec id="s3c" hwp:id="sec-9"><title hwp:id="title-10">Recruitment and Procedure</title><p hwp:id="p-16">Two groups of children aged 5 to 18 years are being recruited. The CALM group (n=800) are referred via health and education practitioners. These include school Special Educational Needs Coordinators (SENCos), paediatricians, speech and language therapists (SaLTs), or psychiatrists and psychologists working in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). The majority of referrers work in the South East of England. Referrers are asked to pass an information pack to families with children who they judge in their professional opinion to have problems in the areas of attention, learning and / or memory. Families send an expression of interest form to CALM if they would like to participate in the study. The research team then contacts the referrer to discuss the child’s problems and asks the referrer to describe the child’s primary reason for referral from a choice of attention, literacy, maths, language, memory problems or general poor educational progress. If the child meets the inclusion criteria a CALM clinic appointment letter is sent to the family. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-1-1" hwp:rel-id="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the likely referral profile for n=800 based on the first n=650 children attending the clinic.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float" hwp:id="T1" hwp:rev-id="xref-table-wrap-1-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;303826v1/TBL1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">T1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">tbl1</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><p hwp:id="p-17">Number of children by referral route and primary reason for referral (n female) for first 650 children attending CALM</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="303826_tbl1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-1"/></table-wrap><p hwp:id="p-18">The TD group will be 200 children who are typically developing. They will be recruited from schools attended by 1 or more children in the CALM group. School SENCos who have referred children with difficulties to CALM will provide a point of contact within schools. All children on the school register with exception of those who have already been referred to CALM, those with sensory impairments and those who are non-native English speakers will be invited to participate. Children will be given an information pack in school to take home to their parents / carers, which will contain an expression of interest form to be returned to CALM. Appointments for assessments at the CALM clinic will be made upon receipt of expression of interest forms.</p><p hwp:id="p-19">All families attend the CALM clinic at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, U.K., for the cognitive and behavioural assessments. At the beginning of the session written consent is obtained from the parent/ carer and verbal assent is taken for the child. The assessment takes approximately 3.5 hours. Families are instructed to administer medication as normal if their child has a prescription, and wear glasses / hearing aids as normal if necessary. Cognitive and learning tasks, plus the child questionnaires, take place one-to-one between the examiner and the child in a dedicated testing room. Families sit in a waiting room outside the testing room and are asked to complete behaviour, family history and mental health questionnaires about the child. For younger children sticker charts are used to motivate the child during the session. All children are awarded a small prize at the end of the session and families are reimbursed for their time and travel.</p><p hwp:id="p-20">The assessment protocol has two scheduled breaks. During the first, the child is invited to provide an optional DNA (saliva) sample. Families are asked to provide separate consent and assent for providing optional DNA samples. The child’s height and weight is also measured in this break. During the second break the family is given the opportunity to try a mock MRI scanner. The researcher explains how an MRI scan works and gives the child the opportunity to practice going inside and laying still the mock scanner. At the end of the cognitive testing session, families are invited for an additional visit for the child to have an optional MRI scan. Expressions of interest for scanning are taken at this time and followed up with a telephone call to make a separate appointment and ensure the child is suitable for scanning. Consent and assent for scanning are obtained prior to the MRI scan. All families are asked to provide optional consent to be contacted regarding future research projects.</p><p hwp:id="p-21">Families are reimbursed for their time and travel. Following the cognitive and behavioural assessment a report summarising the child’s strengths and weaknesses is sent to referrers of children in the CALM group (n=800) to be used by the referrer to guide their ongoing support for the child.</p><sec id="s3c1" hwp:id="sec-10"><title hwp:id="title-11">Recruitment Phases</title><p hwp:id="p-22">The children (N = 1000) are being recruited in four phases.

The maximum list length is nine digits. Backward Digit Recall (verbal WM) follows the same procedure except children attempt to recall the memory items in reverse sequence. Maximum list length is set to seven digits. The Dot Matrix subtest (visuo-spatial STM) requires children to recall the locations of a series of dots presented one at a time in a four by four matrix. Up to nine dots can be presented in a sequence. In Mr X (visuo-spatial WM) the child must first decide whether the two Mr X figures are holding a ball in the same hand as each other. The Mr X figure on the left is upright, while the Mr X on the right can be rotated to one of seven positions. The child is asked to remember the location of the ball held by the Mr X on the right, and after successive displays of pairs of Mr Xs the child attempts serial recall of positions in which the ball was held.

The instruction sequences consist of descriptions of actions to be performed on a set of five stationery items (a ruler, an eraser, a pencil, a folder, and a box), in each of three colours (red, yellow, or blue). There are two actions: touch (e.g., touch the red pencil) and pick up (e.g., pick up the yellow ruler). Actions involving touching and picking up are concatenated using the adverb “then” to produce increasingly longer sequences that vary in length but not in lexical complexity. A span-type procedure is employed in which the length of the instruction sequence increases systematically. Each span consists of a block of six trials. Testing starts at one action (e.g., Touch the red ruler), increases by one action per block (e.g., touch the red ruler and then pick up the yellow pencil), and is terminated after three incorrect trials in one block. The object array is in view at all times. Participants listen to the instructions and are restricted from manipulating any of the objects. At the end of the presentation, participants are asked to perform the actions in sequence. Responses are recorded as accurate if all elements of the individual action phrase—action, object, and colour—are correctly recalled in their original serial position in the instruction sequence.

The Simple Reaction Time subtest measures attention-based reaction time. Children focus on a square centred on a blank screen and press a key as soon as blue blob appears anywhere on screen. The task lasts six minutes on average and average response time in seconds is scored. Sustained attention is measured using the Vigil (8 years +) and Barking (&lt;8 years) subtests that require children to count in their heads the number of auditory items (bleeps or barks) heard at random intervals over ten trials. The number of trials correct is scored. Visual selective attention is assessed using the Hector Cancellation (8 years+) and Balloon Hunt (&lt;8years) subtests. Both are time-limited cancellation tasks requiring children to cross out as many target items (either balloons or circles) as possible in a visual scene presented on paper. There are six scenes in total for Hector Cancellation and four for Balloon Hunt. Each varies by the number of distractor items. The total number of targets correctly identified across all scenes is recorded. The switching task, Reds, Blues, Bags and Shoes, is administered only to children over the age of 8 years. Children first sort four repeating visual items (red or blue bags and shoes) according to colour (red or blue) or use (worn on the hand or foot). In further trials children must switch between the sorting rules after every five items. The raw score is mean reaction time on switch trials.

A basal set is established when a child completes all 12 items in set with one or no errors. If the child makes more than one error, previous sets are administered in reverse order until the basal set is established. Subsequent sets of increasing difficulty are administered until the ceiling set is established: eight or more errors in a set of 12 items.

Such methods will include class-based analyses (e.g. latent class or cluster analyses) and clustering algorithms that have been previously used to identify groups of children with distinct learning profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">Archibald, Cardy, Joanisse &amp; Ansari, 2013</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-56">Direct group comparisons will be made via MANOVAs to test particular hypotheses as the dataset is formed. Bayesian methods will be employed to evaluate the strength of the evidence for and against the null hypothesis in addition to traditional null hypothesis testing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Kass &amp; Raftery, 1995</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-43"><title hwp:id="title-44">Discussion</title><p hwp:id="p-57">Supporting adults with learning difficulties costs the UK’s NHS £560 million per year for inpatient care.
