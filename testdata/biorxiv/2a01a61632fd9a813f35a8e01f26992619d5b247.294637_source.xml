Resolving these cell types requires both single neuron resolution and high throughput, a challenging combination with conventional methods. Here we introduce BARseq, a multiplexed method based on RNA barcoding for mapping projections of thousands of spatially resolved neurons in a single brain, and relating those projections to other properties such as gene or Cre expression. Mapping the projections to 11 areas of 3579 neurons in mouse auditory cortex using BARseq confirmed the laminar organization of the three top classes (IT, PT-like and CT) of projection neurons. In depth analysis uncovered a novel projection type restricted almost exclusively to transcriptionally-defined subtypes of IT neurons. By bridging anatomical and transcriptomic approaches at cellular resolution with high throughput, BARseq can potentially uncover the organizing principles underlying the structure and formation of neural circuits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Key words</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">high throughput</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">projection mapping</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">cellular barcoding</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4"><italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">auditory cortex</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-6">cell type</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="70"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta hwp:id="custom-meta-1"><meta-name>special-property</meta-name><meta-value>contains-inline-supplementary-material</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta-wrap>

Within these structures are uncounted different neuronal types, each characterized by its own pattern of connections, gene expression and physiological properties. Understanding how diverse neurons are organized thus requires methods that can map various neuronal characteristics at cellular resolution, with high-throughput, in single brains.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">A particular challenge is to map the long-range axonal projection patterns that form the physical basis for neuronal circuits across brain areas. Traditional neuroanatomical methods based on microscopy can be used to visualize neuronal morphology, including long-range projections, but the throughput of these methods remains low despite recent advances in methodology (up to â¼50 neurons per single cortical area) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">Economo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Gong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54" hwp:id="xref-ref-54-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-54">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, these methods usually rely on dedicated imaging platforms specifically designed for neuronal tracing, which are not widely accessible to many laboratories.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">To allow high-throughput projection mapping, we previously developed MAPseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">Han et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">Kebschull et al., 2016a</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">left</italic>), a sequencing-based method capable of mapping projections of thousands of single neurons in a single brain. MAPseq achieves multiplexing by uniquely labeling individual neurons with random RNA sequences, or âbarcodes.â However, like most other sequencing methods, the original MAPseq protocol relies on tissue homogenization, so the precise location of each soma is lost. Thus with MAPseq, it is difficult to combine information about projections with other types of information, such as gene expression and neuronal activity.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4 xref-fig-1-5 xref-fig-1-6 xref-fig-1-7 xref-fig-1-8 xref-fig-1-9 xref-fig-1-10 xref-fig-1-11 xref-fig-1-12"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;294637v3/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><p hwp:id="p-7">Multiplexed projection mapping using <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing. (A) Workflow of MAPseq (<italic toggle="yes">left</italic>) and BARseq (<italic toggle="yes">right</italic>). In both MAPseq and BARseq, a barcoded viral library is delivered to the area of interest. The source area and several target areas are then dissected. In MAPseq, barcodes in all dissected areas are sequenced using Next-Gen Sequencing (NGS). Barcodes at the source site are then matched to those at the targets to find the projection patterns of individual neurons. In BARseq, the injection site is sequenced <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic>, thus preserving spatial information. (B) NGS vs. <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing. In conventional NGS (<italic toggle="yes">top</italic>), DNAs are anchored to a flow cell (blue), amplified locally, and sequenced. During each sequencing cycle, one fluorescence-labeled base is incorporated using the amplified DNA as template. The sequence is read out from the sequence of fluorescence over cycles. In <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing (<italic toggle="yes">bottom</italic>), RNA is reverse transcribed and amplified <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> on a slide (yellow). The amplified cDNAs are then sequenced using the same chemistry as NGS and imaged <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic>. Sequences can be read out together with spatial information. (C) Comparison of <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing and hybridization techniques. Methods shown on the left use multiple rounds of hybridization to probe and read out multiple mRNAs. Methods shown in the middle use sequencing to multiplex read out of <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> hybridization signals. Methods shown on the right copy target sequences from the mRNA into the rolonies, allowing true sequencing of mRNA <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic>. (a) In merFISH, multiple probes with barcode sequences on both ends are hybridized to each target mRNA. The probes are then read out using multiple rounds of hybridization using fluorescently labeled secondary probes. (b) In seqFISH, multiple rounds of HCR (hybridization chain reaction)-amplified FISH are carried out on the same target mRNAs, and the mRNA identities are read out using the color sequence. (c) In STARmap, a linear probe and a padlock probe are hybridized to adjacent sequences on the target. When bound, the linear probe acts as a splint to allow circularization of the padlock probe. The circularized padlock probe is then used as template for rolling circle amplification (RCA). (d) In the non-gapfilling padlock method, the target mRNA is reverse-transcribed to cDNA. A padlock probe then hybridizes to the cDNA and is circularized. The circularized padlock probe is then used as template for RCA. (e) In the Circligase-based FISSEQ, the cDNA is circularized using an ssDNA ligase. This circularized cDNA is then used as template for RCA. (f) The gapfilling padlock method is similar to the non-gapfilling version, except that a gap between the two arms of the padlock is filled by copying from the cDNA, thus allowing the actual cDNA to be sequenced. (D) Representative images of barcode rolonies (yellow) generated in primary hippocampal neuronal culture coexpressing barcodes and GFP (cyan). All GFP positive neurons were filled with barcode amplicons, indicating efficient barcode amplification in neuronal somata. (E) Images of the first four sequencing cycles of the same neurons shown in (D). The bases corresponding to the four colors and the sequences of the three neurons circled in (E) are indicated to the right.

BARseq preserves the spatial organization of neurons during projection mapping, and further allows co-registration of neuronal projections with mRNA expression in a single specimen. We show that BARseq is able to recapitulate the known spatial organization of major classes of neocortical excitatory neuronsâcorticothalamic (CT), pyramidal tract-like (PT-l; we call these neurons pyramidal tract-like because, unlike pyramidal tract neurons in the motor cortex, these neurons in the auditory cortex do not project to the spinal cord), and intratelencephalic (IT) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">Shepherd, 2013</xref>)âin the mouse auditory cortex and can additionally uncover previously unknown organization beyond these major classes. BARseq thereby complements traditional neuro-anatomical approaches by providing a high-throughput method for linking axonal projections, spatial organization, gene expression, and potentially other neuronal properties that define neuronal cell types and circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-5">Results</title><p hwp:id="p-9">In what follows, we first demonstrate robust <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing of cellular barcodes in neuronal culture.

By contrast, cellular barcodes used for projection mapping are much shorter (30-nt), more diverse (â¼10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup>), and may differ from each other by just a few nucleotides.

To confirm that BARseq maintains the high sensitivity and accuracy of MAPseq, we compared it to conventional retrograde cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) tracing of contralateral projections. We injected a highly diverse (â¼10<sup>7</sup> barcodes) viral library into the auditory cortex and CTB in the contralateral auditory cortex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-6" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2G, H</xref>).

Projection patterns obtained from bulk tracing were mostly those expected from PT-l neurons, but also included some callosal projections, suggesting a small contribution from Fezf2-expressing IT neurons (Matho et al., in preparation). We sequenced 1291 projection neurons with good sequencing quality <italic toggle="yes">in situ,</italic> including 72 neurons co-labeled by tdTomato driven by Fezf2-2A-CreER, and assayed their projection patterns to 11 target areas (see STAR Methods). The Fezf2+ population included 53 (74%) PT-l neurons projecting to the tectum and the thalamus, eight (11%) CT neurons projecting to the thalamus only, nine (13%) IT neurons in layer 5 projecting to the contralateral cortex, and two (3%) neurons in layer 5 projecting to the striatum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-2" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). The lack of corticotectal projection in the callosal projecting neurons is unlikely an artifact caused by limited detection sensitivity of corticotectal projections, because these neurons also project to other telencephalic areas that PT-l neurons do not. Neurons labeled with Fezf2-2A-CreER thus consisted mainly of PT-l neurons, along with a small fraction of callosally-projecting neurons in layer 5 and CT neurons in layer 6. The projection patterns of Fezf2+ neurons were thus consistent with previous bulk cell-type specific tracing results using the same Cre line (Matho et al., in preparation).

To determine the extent of contamination from fibers of passage, we examined the striatal projections of putative CT neurons (i.e. neurons that project to the thalamus, but not to any cortical area or the tectum) and putative PT-l neurons (i.e. neurons that project to the tectum, the thalamus, but not to any cortical area) from the two BARseq brains (the MAPseq brain was excluded because it may include PT-l neurons from neighboring areas that did not project to the tectum, and may be misidentified as CT neurons). Both types of neurons send descending fibers through the internal capsule adjacent to the caudal striatum, and thus can be used to evaluate fibers of passage contamination in the striatum. Consistent with the fact that PT-l but not CT neurons project to the striatum, only 8 / 250 (3.2%) putative CT neurons sequenced <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> projected to the caudal striatum, whereas 59 / 245 (24%) putative PT-l neurons sequenced <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> projected to the caudal striatum. The fact that â¼97% of putative CT neurons did not show projection to the caudal striatum reinforce previous observations that fibers of passage have minimal impact on projections mapped in these experiments.</p><p hwp:id="p-28">At the mesoscopic level, the projection patterns of the auditory cortex revealed by BARseq were consistent with anterograde tracing in the Allen Mouse Connectivity Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">Oh et al., 2014</xref>). In MAPseq and BARseq, the strength of the projection of a neuron to a target is given by the number of individual barcode molecules from that neuron recovered at the target. This is analogous to a conventional fluorophore mapping experiment, in which projection strength is assumed to be proportional to GFP intensity.

BARseq thus provides quantitative measurements of long-range projections in the auditory cortex consistent with those obtained by conventional bulk labeling techniques.</p><p hwp:id="p-29">The projection patterns of individual neurons were remarkably diverse. To quantify this diversity, we binarized projection patterns, using a conservative threshold for projection detection (four molecules per barcode per area, given by the OB negative control). We observed 264 distinct patterns, or 13% of the 2<sup>11</sup> = 2048 possible patterns. This high diversity was unlikely an artifact of projections missed by BARseq due to false negatives: 237 to 247 unique projection patterns remain even when a false negative rate of 10-15% was assumed (see STAR Methods). This high diversity was also unlikely to be caused by limited sensitivity of MAPseq for neurons with fewer barcodes overall: A significant fraction of these projection patterns (112 / 264 = 42%) can be accounted for solely by strong projections (see STAR Methods), and eliminating neurons with weaker primary projections resulted in only a moderate reduction in the diversity of projection patterns (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-5" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>, blue line). Furthermore, this reduction was largely due to the reduction in sample size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-6" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>, red line). Because of the conservative thresholding we used and the fact that the auditory cortex may project to areas we did not sample, the actual number of distinct projection patterns may be higher.</p><p hwp:id="p-30">The majority (85%) of cortical projection neurons projected to two or more target areas (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-7" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>) after binarization. The ratio of the projection strengths of the two strongest projections follow a log normal distribution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-8" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>), and about half of all neurons have a secondary projection that is at least 20% as strong as their primary projections. These estimates were based on neurons whose primary projections were strong enough to observe a secondary projection, and therefore were not limited by the sensitivity of MAPseq/BARseq or by the variability in the expression level of barcodes. This high projection diversity and multiple projections per neuron are consistent with findings in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-7" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">Han et al., 2018</xref>), and may be a general feature of cortical projections.</p></sec><sec id="s2f" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-11">BARseq recovers structured projections across major classes of projection neurons</title><p hwp:id="p-31">Simple hierarchical clustering on the non-binarized projections (see STAR Methods) partitioned neurons into established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>) cortical classes: CT (corticothalamic), PT-l (pyramidal tract-like), and IT (intratelencephalic, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-1" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).

As expected, the major classes segregated strongly with laminar position: Superficial layers contained predominantly IT neurons, whereas deep layers contained predominantly PT-l and CT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-2" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>; see STAR Methods and Fig. S3B-E for the estimation of layers using layer-specific marker genes).

First, although IT neurons projected to both the caudal striatumâan area implicated in auditory decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55" hwp:id="xref-ref-55-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-55">Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013</xref>)âand the rostral striatum, PT-l neurons projected only to the caudal striatum. We confirmed this finding by triple retrograde tracing (Fig. S4A): A significant fraction of neurons (66 / 296) projecting to the rostral striatum also projected to the caudal striatum, but none (0 / 296) projected to the tectum (Fig. S4B, C). Second, we identified a minor population of PT-l neurons in layer 6 of the auditory cortex in addition to the more common layer 5 PT-l neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-3" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This population of layer 6 PT-l neurons has previously been reported to differ from the layer 5 PT-l neurons based on physiological and other properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">Slater et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to the differences observed between the layer 5 and layer 6 PT-l neurons, the corticotectal projections were slightly stronger in layer 5 than those in layer 6, but with considerable overlap [Fig. S4D (PT-Tect); 11.7 Â± 2.2 (mean Â± stdev), N = 80 for layer 6 neurons and 13.8 Â± 1.6, N = 185 for layer 5 neurons, p &lt; 0.0001 using bootstrap K-S test]. The strengths of other major projections were indistinguishable between the two groups (Fig. S4D-PT, p = 0.5 for both corticothalamic projections and corticostriatal projections using bootstrap K-S test). The results of BARseq were thus consistent with, but went beyond, classical taxonomy.</p></sec><sec id="s2g" hwp:id="sec-9"><title hwp:id="title-12">Projection subclusters do not segregate by laminae</title><p hwp:id="p-35">Even within the major classes, projections from the auditory cortex to individual targets were often correlated (Fig. S5A). For example, an ITi neuron with a strong projection to the somatosensory cortex was also likely to have a strong projection to the visual cortex, but a weak striatal projection (Fig S5Ab). Such correlations suggest that the remarkable diversity of projections did not arise purely by chance, e.g. by a process in which each neuron selected targets at random. We therefore exploited the large sample size available from BARseq to look for statistical signatures of the organization of projections from auditory cortex.</p><p hwp:id="p-36">To explore the statistical structure underlying these projection patterns, we performed hierarchical clustering on the projection patterns. For this analysis, we did not binarize the projection patterns; we considered not only whether a neuron projected to an area, but also the strength of that projection. This clustering uncovered structure well beyond the previously established top-level classes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-4" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5C, D</xref>; see Fig. S5B-E and STAR Methods for details of clustering methods). Depending on the precise clustering algorithm and statistical criteria used (Fig. S5F), as many as 25 subclusters were revealed. Most of these subclusters were robust: 5682/6391 (89%) of neurons were unambiguously assigned into one of the 25 subclusters using a probabilistic approach (see STAR Methods; Fig. S5G, H). All top-level subclusters were observed in all three brains (Fig. S6A; see STAR Methods for likely misclassification of some striatal-projecting PT-l neurons as CT neurons due to choice of projection targets sampled). BARseq thus uncovered organization in projections well beyond the previously described major divisions.</p><p hwp:id="p-37">As noted above, the three major cortical classesâPT-l, IT and CTâare spatially segregated into laminae. By contrast, most subclusters defined by projection pattern, especially those within the IT class, spanned many layers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-5" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5C, E</xref>; p = 0.95 for cluster hierarchy 2-7, Kurskal-Wallis test; see STAR Methods). For example, a subcluster consisting of IT neurons that project only to contralateral cortical areas, but not the ipsilateral cortex or the striatum (Leaf 1, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-6" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), can be found across all laminae. This mixed laminar distribution of projection patterns was consistent across brains (Fig. S6B, C; see STAR Methods). Therefore, laminar position could not fully explain projection patterns or diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2h" hwp:id="sec-10"><title hwp:id="title-13">BARseq associates projections with transcriptionally defined IT subtypes</title><p hwp:id="p-38">Although projection subclusters did not segregate cleanly into laminae, we hypothesized that the conjunction of laminar position and gene expression might predict projection patterns.

Because the presence of a contralateral projection is the characteristic that distinguishes the ITc from the ITi projection subcluster, most (84%; 377/448) IT1 or IT2 neurons were ITc, whereas fewer than half (43%; 123/287) of IT3 or IT4 neurons were ITc (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-5" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>). These features of projections specific to IT3 and IT4 subtypes reinforce the observation that the rules governing the projections of IT3 and IT4 neurons are distinct from those governing IT1 and IT2 neurons.</p><p hwp:id="p-47">Finally, we discovered finer quantitative differences across individual subtypes defined by gene expression. Although we identified two projection patterns (contralateral projections to deep layers and ITi-Ctx projections) shared by both IT3 and IT4, these two projection patterns were differentially enriched between the two subtypes. ITi-Ctx projections were both stronger (Fig. S7C, p = 0.012 comparing IT3 and IT4 using rank sum test) and more frequent in IT4 subtype compared to those in IT3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-6" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>; 13% in IT3 compared to 34% in IT4 neurons, p = 3e-5 using Fisherâs exact test). In contrast, contralateral projections were twice as frequent in IT3 neurons compared to IT4 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-7" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>; 89 / 155 IT3 neurons compared to 34 / 132 IT4 neurons, p = 6e-8 using Fisherâs exact test). Within a subtype defined by gene expression, projections further correlate with gene expression: The probability of projecting contralaterally was higher among IT3 neurons with high Cdh13 expression (p = 0.001, Fisherâs exact test, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-8" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>), an observation further confirmed using CTB retrograde tracing (Fig. S7D, p &lt; 0.0001 using rank sum test).</p><p hwp:id="p-48">Although the analyses above support the idea that gene expression and laminar position are correlated with projection pattern, the relationship between IT subtypes defined by gene expression and subclusters defined by projection patterns was in general complex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-9" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>). Thus, although some projection patterns were enriched in some subtypes [e.g., ITi-Ctx neurons (leaf 14 and 15) and ITc neurons of leaf 4 and 5; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-10" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>], no projection subcluster was specific to a single subtype. Indeed, in many cases, the same projection subcluster could be found in all four IT subtypes; two examples of projection subclusters found in all four transcriptomic subtypes are shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-11" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7F</xref>. Such shared projection patterns across subtypes were common: 54% of IT neurons (400 / 735) were more similar in projections to a neuron of a different IT subtype than to any neuron of its own subtype (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-12" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7G</xref>; Fig. S7E-G). This mixed projection pattern is in contrast to the clear separation of projection patterns across the three higher-level classes of neurons (IT/PT-l/CT). Thus whereas at the top levels of the hierarchies, the classical partitioning into IT/PT-l/CT neurons captures the correlational structure of multiple cellular properties, including gene expression, laminar position and projection pattern, our results suggest that further subclustering based on one experimental property (such as gene expression) leads to categories that do not map neatly onto clustering based on another property (such as projections).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" hwp:id="sec-12"><title hwp:id="title-15">Discussion</title><p hwp:id="p-49">Here we have described BARseq, a barcoding-based neuroanatomical method that can relate high-throughput projection mapping with other neuronal properties at cellular resolution through <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing. As a proof of principle, we applied BARseq to the projections in the auditory cortex. BARseq of 3579 neurons recapitulated the organization of cortical projections into the classic IT/PT-l/CT subtypes. Within these classic subtypes, BARseq also revealed the impressive diversity of projection patterns: We observed 264 distinct projection patterns, falling into as many as 25 distinct clusters. We then combined BARseq with single cell analysis of gene expression of an additional 735 IT neurons. We identified projection patterns exclusive to, or enriched in, specific transcriptionally defined subtypes. BARseq thus revealed rich and complex relationships between gene expression and projection patterns that would have been difficult to uncover using conventional transcriptomic and/or anatomical techniques.</p><sec id="s3a" hwp:id="sec-13"><title hwp:id="title-16">Multiplexed projection mapping using cellular barcodes</title><p hwp:id="p-50">BARseq achieves multiplexed projection mapping by matching barcode sequences found at the soma with sequences recovered at projection targets. This strategy, which differs fundamentally from that used by traditional single-neuron tracing experiments based on one or a few distinct tracers, confers both unique advantages and limitations upon BARseq.</p><p hwp:id="p-51">BARseq fundamentally differs from conventional optical approaches in that projections are determined by matching barcodes, not tracing. Barcode matching, unlike optical tracing, does not accumulate error over distance. In conventional optical approaches to mapping projections, axons are reconstructed by observing continuity between successive optical or physical sections. Any lost or distorted section may result in an error, and in general the probability of error increases exponentially with the length of the axonal projection and the number of neurites multiplexed. For example, even with a low error rate of 1% per 50 Âµm, more than half of axons traced would be in error within 5 mm. By contrast, because BARseq relies on matching sequences to reconstruct projections, errors do not accumulate for long axons: A distant subcortical projection is just as reliably matched to its source as a projection to a nearby cortical area. Furthermore, the high diversity of barcodes (tens of millions in our experiments) can uniquely label tens of thousands of neurons in a single experiment. Therefore BARseq can determine projection patterns for orders of magnitude higher densities of neurons (hundreds to thousands of neurons per cortical area, and tens of thousands neurons per brain) than even the most advanced state-of-the-art multiplexed optical tracing methods [â¼50 neurons per cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">Lin et al., 2018</xref>)], without the need of specialized high-speed microscope that is often required for advanced anatomical techniques.</p><p hwp:id="p-52">In BARseq, the spatial resolution at which projections are resolved is determined by the size of the cubelets dissected. In this study, we chose to dissect brains relatively coarselyâonly sufficient to distinguish among brain areas and between superficial and deep cortical layers, but this resolution was sufficient to resolve the organization of projections across neuronal subtypes. For questions requiring higher spatial resolution, BARseq can be further improved with laser capture microdissection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Huang et al., 2018</xref>) or direct <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing of projection barcodes, thus potentially resolving axonal projections and dendritic morphology at subcellular resolution. Such an approach would yield an âinfinite color Brainbow,â allowing reconstruction of densely labeled neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3b" hwp:id="sec-14"><title hwp:id="title-17">The organization of projections across neuronal subtypes</title><p hwp:id="p-53">The partitioning of neurons into types and subtypes is useful to the extent that these classes can infer multiple neuronal properties. The utility of these classes and subclasses arises from the fact that these properties co-vary. For example, knowing whether a cortical neuron is excitatory or inhibitory, or the excitatory subtype (IT/PT-l/CT) to which it belongs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>), allows us to infer a great deal about the neuronâs pattern of gene expression, morphology, connectivity and projection pattern. The partitioning of cortical neurons into excitatory vs. inhibitory, and of excitatory neurons into IT/PT-l/CT subtypes, is well supported by many lines of data.</p><p hwp:id="p-54">Within these major subtypes of excitatory neuron, the predictive value of further subdivisions has been less clear. It has been reported that some PT-l subtypes defined by gene expression correspond to specific projection patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">Economo et al., 2018</xref>), and some CT subtypes show subtype-dependent biases in their projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">Chevee et al., 2018</xref>). However, a systematic approach to determining the co-variance of two or more properties would require high-throughput measurements of multiple properties simultaneously, a feat that would be challenging using previous approaches. Indeed, it has only recently been possible to obtain such data on even a single property such as gene expression or projection pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-9" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">Kebschull et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-55">The combination of BARseq with <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> transcriptional mapping has the potential to systematically determine the co-variation of multiple properties. As a proof-of-principle, we combined BARseq and FISH to explore the projections of transcriptionally defined IT subtypes. Using this approach, we identified a novel projection pattern (ITi-Ctx) restricted almost entirely to two transcriptionally defined IT subtypes (IT3 and IT4). We also identified several other ways in which patterns of gene expression covaried with projection patterns (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-13" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). However, in marked contrast to the one-to-one relationship between top-level subtypes (IT/CT/PT-l) defined by gene expression and projection pattern, we did not observe a simple mapping of these properties within IT neurons.</p><p hwp:id="p-56">The mixed projection patterns observed across IT subtypes defined by gene expression are unlikely to have resulted from errors in classifying neurons to subtypes, because we were able to identify both specific and promiscuous projection patterns in the same IT subtypes. This question can be further tested by correlating projections with more marker genes to better define IT subtypes by gene expression. To achieve this, BARseq can potentially be combined with highly-multiplexed FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Codeluppi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Eng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">Shah et al., 2016</xref>) or <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> sequencing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-7" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">Ke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50" hwp:id="xref-ref-50-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-50">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) to correlate the expression of dozens to hundreds of genes to projections.

Briefly, the neurons were fixed in 10% formalin, washed in PBST (PBS with 0.5% tween-20), and dehydrated in 70%, 85%, and 100% ethanol for an hour. After rehydration in PBST, we incubated the samples in 0.1M HCl for 5 mins, followed by three PBST washes.

The ImmEdge hydrophobic barrier pen also produced good amplification (Fig. S1Ad), but the HybriWell-FL system offered better control of liquid evaporation during heating steps and easier handling. All slides with brain slices were thus first sealed in HybriWell-FL chambers (22 mm x 22 mm x 0.25 mm; Grace Bio-labs) for reactions. The brain slices were washed three times in PBS supplemented with 0.5% Tween-20 (PBST), followed by a pepsin digestion step. This step was necessary to increase accessibility of fixed RNAs (Fig. S1B) and to reduce the GFP signal from the cells (cyan in Fig. S1B), which may interfere with sequencing signals. We found that 3 mins of 0.2% pepsin digestion in 0.1 M HCl at room temperature greatly increased rolony formation (Fig. S1Bb) compared to no pepsin treatment (Fig. S1Ba), whereas 5 mins of pepsin digestion caused excessive tissue loss (Fig. S1Bc). We therefore used 3 mins of pepsin digestion for BaristaSeq in most brain slices, but the optimal timing could vary with different fixation conditions.

A Fezf2-2A-CreER::Ai14 animal was injected at three postnatal months with barcodes in the auditory cortex as described above for BARseq. After 24 hours, the animal was anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The injection site was punched out using a 2 mm diameter biopsy punch, and the rest of the brain was flash frozen for dissection of projection areas. The injection site punch was then post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 hours, cryo-protected in 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose in PBS for 12 hours each, mounted in OCT, and frozen. The punch was then cryo-sectioned to 14 um slices using the tape-transfer system and imaged for GFP, RFP, and DIC channels on a Nikon TE2000 microscope with a Crest X-light spinning disk confocal. The slices were then processed for BARseq as described above. Sequencing was done as described above for 14 cycles, except that the imaging was done on a Nikon TE2000 microscope with a Crest X-light spinning disk confocal. In addition, a set of sequencing images was taken after each cleavage step. This background image records the residual tdTomato signals in the sequencing images. After registering and subtracting the background image from sequencing images, we then median filtered the images, performed background subtraction, corrected for channel bleed-through, and registered sequencing images as described above. We also registered the âTâ channel of the first sequencing cycle to the tdTomato images taken before library preparation. We then picked cell bodies from the sequencing images using the âFind Maximaâ function in ImageJ, base-called for barcode sequences, and read out the intensity from the tdTomato images. We filtered out cells with sequencing quality lower than 0.7. We considered cells with tdTomato signal over 20000 as Fezf2+ neurons. These cells were visually inspected to make sure that they had good morphology and were labeled by tdTomato.

To estimate the contribution of strong projections, we defined a strong secondary projection as one whose normalized count for a particular barcode was at least 10% of the strongest projection for that barcode.</p><p hwp:id="p-113">We then estimated whether each projection pattern could have resulted from missing projections due to false negatives. For each âtargetâ projection pattern, we identified all âparentâ projection patterns with one more projection.

If the ratio of neurons with the target projection pattern to the ratio of neurons with parent projection patterns was smaller than the false negative rate, then we eliminated the target projection pattern. We repeated this process for all projection patterns, and counted the remaining projection patterns.

This would allow at least 2 barcodes to be observed in the secondary projection.

Louvain community detection identified 2-4 clusters at each hierarchy, and therefore did not fully correspond to the clusters obtained by bifurcation only at any hierarchical level. However, the resulting clusters from both methods, especially high-level nodes, were similar to those obtained using k-means. We chose to base all further analyses on clustering using k-means, because the major classes were better separated than using spectral clustering and the imposed bifurcation was easier to interpret than the clusters produced by Louvain community detection.</p><p hwp:id="p-120">We then used a probabilistic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>) to assign neurons to these clusters. For each pair of clusters, we trained a random forest classifier on 80% of the data. We then used the classifier to classify the remaining 20% of the data. We repeated this process five times, each time using a mutually exclusive group of 20% of data, so that all data were classified once. We repeated this whole process 10 times for each pair of clusters, so that all data were classified between each pair of clusters 10 times. For each barcode, we then removed all cluster memberships that were scored 0 out of 10 in any one of the pairs involving that cluster. The remaining clusters (i.e. ones that have scored at least 1 out of 10 comparisons in any pairwise comparison) were assigned to the barcode, with the main identity as the cluster with the highest sum of scores across all pairwise comparisons involving that cluster. The majority of neurons (5968/6391, or 93% of all neurons) were uniquely assigned to a single cluster with high probability (&gt;98% probability), but a small set of neurons (421/6391, or 7% of all neurons) were assigned to two clusters at around 50% probability each (Fig. S5G).</p><p hwp:id="p-121">Although BARseq has a low false-negative rate (â¼10%), such a false-negative rate may accumulate for subclusters with multiple projections, leading to higher rate in misclassification. To examine the extent of such misclassification, we classified neurons probabilistically using 10 out of the 11 projections, thus simulating the effect of a projection being uninformative (Fig. S5H). This analysis revealed similar distribution of neurons with the majority being well-classified and a smaller fraction being ambiguously assigned to two or more clusters. We then considered a neuron ambiguously classified if it was assigned to two or more clusters using all 11 projections, or assigned to the wrong cluster using any of the 10 projections if the resulting cluster was consistent with a dropped projection rather than a false-positive projection. This resulted in 5682/6391 (89%) well-classified neurons and 709/6391 (11%) ambiguous neurons. These estimates represent an upper bound on the number of ambiguous neurons, because it did not take into consideration the actual low false-negative rate of BARseq.

Layer 6 CT neurons, however, usually do not project to the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">Shepherd, 2013</xref>). The apparent striatal projections could be caused by contamination by fibers passing through the striatum. Alternatively, these neurons could be PT-l neurons in layer 5 and deep layer 6 whose subcerebral projections were missed due to either weak projections in the tectum or projections to other targets rather than the tectum. This is especially likely since we did not sample many potential target areas for PT-l neurons, such as the brain stem. Our analyses of projection neurons <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> support the latter hypothesis. We observed a total of 590 corticothalamic neurons that did not project to the tectum or the striatum, and 505 that did project to the striatum.

Therefore, most of the striatum and thalamus projecting neurons were from the conventional MAPseq brain (XC14). Because we only sequenced neurons at the center of each injection site <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> (XC9 and XC28), but collected a much larger injection site that may have included neighboring cortical areas in the conventional MAPseq brain (XC14), these neurons were rare in the auditory cortex, and were more likely in neighboring cortical areas, where PT-l neurons could project to other targets.

These results suggest that most of the striatum projecting âcorticothalamicâ neurons were likely PT-l neurons in layer 5 and deep layer 6 in neighboring cortical areas.

Furthermore, the distribution of neurons was also consistent across brains: the average laminar locations of neurons from each brain were similar for all but one subcluster (Fig. S6C; p &gt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction, Mann-Whitney U test). The one exception was CT neurons, which were on average 50 Âµm deeper in XC28 than in XC9 (Fig. S6C; p &lt; 0.0005 after Bonferroni correction), probably because more deep L6 neurons were labeled in XC28 than in XC9 (XC9 and XC28 had 165 and 132 L6 labeled neurons with laminar depths &lt; 1000 Âµm, respectively, compared to 56 and 129 L6 neurons with laminar depths &gt; 1000 Âµm; p &lt; 1e-7 using Fisherâs exact test).

The tube was closed and gently rocked at 30 Â°C for 40 mins. The digested tissues were then transferred to a tube containing 2 mL HABG pre-warmed to 30 Â°C and triturated 10 times using a salinized pipette with 500 Âµm opening. The undissociated tissues were then transferred to a new tube with 2 mL HABG and triturated 10 times using a salinized pipette with 500 Âµm opening. The remaining undissociated tissues were again transferred to a new tube with 2mL HABG and triturated 5 times. The three tubes of 2 mL HABG each were then combined, and carefully laid on top of a density gradient of 17.3%, 12.4%, 9.9%, and 7.4% (v/v) Optiprep in HABG. This tube was centrifuged at 750 g for 15 mins. The top two fractions were then removed. The next two fractions and half of the bottom fraction, which contained neurons, were collected. The remaining 0.5 mL of the last fraction and the pellet were discarded. The collected neuronal fraction (about 2.5 mL), was diluted in 5mL HABG and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 mins. The pellet was washed in 5 mL HABG, pelleted again, and resuspended in 100 ÂµL HABG.

The sequencing library was then sequenced using one lane of Illumina NextSeq. The raw sequencing data were processed using Cell Ranger v2 (10x Genomics) to generate the expression matrix. We then further processed the data using Seurat v2. We first filtered out cells with less than 200 unique genes per cell and more than 10% mitochondria RNA per cell) and log normalized the data. We then regressed out either the effect of the percentage of mitochondria genes linearly (Fig. S2A) or both the effect of the percentage of mitochondria genes and endogenous UMI counts (i.e. excluding barcode reads) using a poisson model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-12" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). We then identified barcoded neurons and non-barcoded neurons by thresholding the level of Snap25 expression and barcode counts. We observed a general reduction in gene expression across most genes, but the relative level of expression among these genes were preserved in barcoded cells (Fig. S2A). Although a minor fraction of genes were over-expressed in barcoded cells, we could further correct for both the under-expression among most genes and over-expression in this subset of genes in the barcoded neurons by simply regressing out the effect of endogenous read counts per cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-13" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>), thus restoring the relative gene expression level to the level of the non-barcoded cells.

We reasoned that if Sindbis infection perturbs major structures in gene expression, then principal components of gene expression in non-barcoded neurons should fail to capture the variance of gene expression in barcoded neurons. We identified genes with variable expression and exported the expression of these genes for both barcoded and non-barcoded cells to MATLAB. We then scaled and centered the data in MATLAB and calculated the explained variance of top principal components. Our results (Fig. S2B) showed that the same top principal components explained similar amount of variance in both barcoded and non-barcoded neurons, thus further indicating that the structures in gene expression is preserved in barcoded neurons. Heatmaps of top genes of principal components (Fig. S2C) were generated in Seurat.</p></sec><sec id="s4t" hwp:id="sec-41"><title hwp:id="title-45">Single-cell RNAseq of neurons in the auditory cortex</title><p hwp:id="p-132">For non-barcoded cells in the auditory cortex, the library was prepared using Chromium single cell 3â reagent kit v3 (10x Genomics) and sequenced using one lane of Illumina NextSeq.

Excitatory neurons with high FISH quality is defined by: (1) The neuronal somata were clearly delineated by barcodes; (2) the Slc17a7 reads clearly defined the same soma shape; (3) the neuron did not overlap significantly with neighboring neurons. Cells with fewer than 10 copies of Slc17a7 per cell were further excluded (these might have been cells with low FISH quality, partial cells that were cut during cryo-sectioning, and non-excitatory or non-neuronal cells).
