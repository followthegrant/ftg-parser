To investigate the mechanistic basis of contextual modulation, we use whole-cell recordings to measure odor responses across rapid (&lt;30 min) learning episodes in identified mitral/tufted cells (MTCs). Across these learning episodes, we found that diverse response changes occur already during the first sniff cycle. Motivated mice develop active sniffing strategies across learning, and it is this change of active sampling state that dynamically modulates odor responses, resulting in enhanced discriminability and detectability of odor representation with learning. Evoking fast sniffing in different behavioral states demonstrates that response changes during active sampling exceed those predicted from purely feed-forward input. Finally, response changes are highly correlated in tufted cells, but not mitral cells, indicating cell-type specificity in the effect of active sampling, and resulting in increased odor detectability in the tufted and enhanced discriminability in the mitral cell population over the rapid learning episodes. Altogether, we show that active sampling state is a crucial component in modulating and enhancing olfactory bulb responsiveness on rapid timescales.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="42"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Introduction</title><p hwp:id="p-3">The ability to respond to sensory stimuli according to learning and context is vital for orchestrating appropriate behavior. Our view of sensory processing has shifted away from the simplicity of passive feed-forward models driven by sensory stimuli, to one that additionally incorporates contextual information provided by top-down circuits into the ongoing processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Engel et al., 2001</xref>). This has been driven in part by observations that activity in primary sensory cortex is widely modulated by contextual information: locomotion, attention, reward timing and experience all modulate visual cortex activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">Chubykin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">Fiser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">Ito and Gilbert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>), while whisking behavior and social context modulate barrel cortex activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">Crochet and Petersen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Ferezou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">Lenschow and Brecht, 2015</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-4">The olfactory bulb (OB) is the very first site of odor information processing, yet already modulation of OB neural output by a wealth of contexts and behavioral tasks has been described from recordings of suprathreshold activity, including unit recordings, calcium imaging, and LFP recordings.

Recently, a number of studies have described changes in mitral and tufted cell (MTC) odor responses over the course of olfactory learning (Chu et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Doucette and Restrepo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52" hwp:id="xref-ref-52-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-52">Yamada et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the prominence of such studies, the mechanistic basis underlying contextual modulation of the circuit is still unclear. In particular, rarely have these contextual modulations been interpreted in the framework of active sampling behavior, which is known to be controlled in a complex and context dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">Wachowiak, 2011</xref>), including over the learning of olfactory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">Kepecs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">Wesson et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50" hwp:id="xref-ref-50-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-50">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54" hwp:id="xref-ref-54-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-54">Youngentob et al., 1987</xref>). Not only this, but unit recordings as well as imaging do not have access to subthreshold activity, while the former also has the potential to misidentify cell types and bias recordings toward a subpopulation of MTCs that have high baseline firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">Kollo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-5">To investigate the mechanistic basis of task dependent changes in mitral and tufted cell odor responses, we recorded from identified mitral and tufted cells using blind whole-cell recordings <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> in a range of behavioral states. We optimised training protocols for an olfactory task to facilitate very rapid olfactory discrimination learning episodes, which allowed us to make whole-cell recordings over the full learning epoch. At the same time, we measured sniffing behavior using an external flow sensor. Altogether, we provide evidence that learned active sampling behavior overtly modulates olfactory responses in a cell-type specific way that cannot be explained by feed-forward input, and overall appears to enhance the representation of odors across the olfactory bulb.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">Results</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">There are differences in odor responses according to behavioral state</title><p hwp:id="p-6">We recorded from 23 MTCs in passive mice exposed to repeated stimulation of odor mixtures (Figure S1), as well as 21 MTCs in mice during learning of a simple olfactory go/no-go discrimination task with the same mixtures. In our task-learning mice, after pre-training on different odorants (Figure S2A), mice underwent very rapid learning on a novel pair of odor stimuli, reaching criterion within 10-20 minutes (Figure S2B). It was thus possible to make stable whole-cell recordings over the full timescale of learning. MTCs were distinguished from interneurons as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">Kollo et al., 2014</xref>), using independent component analysis of the AHP waveform. This was confirmed with morphological reconstruction of 9 MTCs (Figure S3; see methods).</p><p hwp:id="p-7">To first determine whether the two behavioral states cause any general change in olfactory bulb physiology, we applied a series of current steps and compared the basic properties of cells between the passive and learning states. Both the passive properties (resting membrane potentials, input resistance and membrane time constants) and spontaneous activity (spontaneous firing rates and sniff phase-modulation of membrane potential â âsniff-V<sub>m</sub> mod.â) of cells revealed little detectable difference in either average values or variance (see supplemental information; Figure S4A-F).</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Next, basic odor response properties were compared between MTCs in passive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; 46 cell-odor pairs) and task-learning mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; 42 cell-odor pairs). Note that all odor responses in the manuscript are aligned on each trial to the first inhalation onset. Comparing passive and learning cohorts by averaging responses across all trials for a given cell-odor pair revealed that firing rate (FR) responses did not overtly differ in distribution between passive and behaving mice (Figure S4G-H). Median FR responses were similar (passive: median = â0.84 Hz, IQR = â2.2-1.1 Hz; learning: median = â0.51 Hz, IQR = â2.8-2.1 Hz, p = 0.84, Ranksum), as was variance across cell-odor pairs (p = 0.42, Brown-Forsythe test). Measuring a cellâs input using subthreshold responses offers us a more sensitive measure of many response parameters, including temporal features and inhibition. Taking average membrane potential responses revealed that these do not differ much between the two behavioral states in terms of means (passive: mean = â1.5 mV, SD = 1.8 mV; learning: mean = â1.7 mV, SD = 2.4 mV; p = 0.67, unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-3" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1C<sub>i-ii</sub></xref>), however response variance was larger across cells in learning mice relative to passive mice, due to higher representation of both strong inhibition and excitatory responses (p = 0.05, unpaired t-test, n = 42 vs 46; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-4" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1C<sub>ii</sub></xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4 xref-fig-1-5 xref-fig-1-6 xref-fig-1-7 xref-fig-1-8 xref-fig-1-9 xref-fig-1-10 xref-fig-1-11 xref-fig-1-12"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;222588v1/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><title hwp:id="title-5">Differences in odor responses according to behavioral state.</title><p hwp:id="p-9">(<bold>A</bold>) Example odor response traces for three different cell-odor pairs recorded in passive mice, aligned to first inhalation onset.

Comparing response onsets between passive and learning mice revealed a significant shift towards earlier onsets in learning mice (passive: median = 85 ms, IQR = 70-110 ms, n = 39; learning: median = 70 ms, IQR = 60-90, n = 36; p = 0.004, Ranksum; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-5" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), with 33% of responses occurring before 70 ms in learning mice, and only 10% in passive mice. Just as for baseline activity (Figure S4F), activity during odor response is often locked to the sniff cycle. We calculated the amplitude of membrane potential modulation when aligned to sniff phase (sniff-V<sub>m</sub> modulation amplitudes) during the odor response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-6" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1E</xref>; see methods for details) to quantify to what degree each cell-odor pair was locked to the sniff cycle during odor stimulation. Overall, passive cell-odor pairs showed a significantly higher degree of patterning by the sniff cycle than learning cell-odor pairs (passive sniff-V<sub>m</sub> modulation amplitude=3.1Â±1.7 mV, n=42; learning: 2.4Â±1.4 mV, n=38, p=0.03, unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-7" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-11">Overall, this analysis revealed that the most overt differences between passive and learning mice were measurable in subthreshold responses, which showed increased variance, shorter latency and less sniff coupling in learning mice.

Overall, in learning mice, 30% (13/42) of cell-odor pairs showed a significant change across learning (p&lt;0.01, unpaired t-test between 5 early and 5 late trials), with 19% (8/42) showing a positive change, and 11% (5/42) showing a negative change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-5" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2E</xref>; Figure S5C). These changes led to an increase in the diversity of responses between early and late trials across the sample, though this did not quite reach significance (early SD = 2 mV, late SD = 2.6 mV; p = 0.06, Bartlett test). On a trial by trial basis, changes in excitatory subthreshold response were reflected by changes in firing rate, though this was not clear for changes in inhibition (Figure S5A-B). In contrast to learning mice, cell-odor pairs recorded in passive mice showed far less frequent significant changes (4%, 2/46 cell-odor pairs), and no change in variance across the sample (SD early = 1.9 mV, SD late = 2.0 mV, p = 0.58, Bartlett test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-6" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2E</xref> and S5D). Overall, there was significantly higher variance in response changes for cell-odor pairs recorded in learning compared to passive mice (learning ÎV<sub>m</sub> SD = 1.5 mV; passive ÎV<sub>m</sub> SD = 1.1 mV; p = 0.02, Bartlett test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-7" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Learning-related changes were not due to time-dependent effects of recording, since recording durations in passive and learning were matched (Figure S5E). Response changes did not reflect the contingency of the odor or response of the animal, since the distribution of changes showed no significant difference between CS+ and CSâ stimuli (p = 0.77, paired t-test; Figure S5F), and were even correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.44, p = 0.001; Figure S5G).</p><p hwp:id="p-15">What aspects of the response change could potentially be used to aid decision making? Mice are known to make simple olfactory discriminations within the timescale of a single sniff cycle. Congruently here, we find reaction times as low as 170 ms (Figure S2C-D). By identifying the onset of response change (see methods), we could show that 71% of identifiable changes occurred prior to 170 ms (median ÎV<sub>m</sub> onset = 120 ms, IQR = 20-220 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-8" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2G</xref> and S5H), and 45% occurred prior to the 1st percentile of sniff durations (107 ms; Figure S5J). Thus, changes occur within the timescale of a single sniff cycle, and therefore could contribute to decision making. To assess the functional consequence of the learning-related changes for odor representation within this short timescale, we constructed a population response vector from the full sample of cell-odor pairs (similar to Figure S5C-D) and calculated the Euclidean distance of this population response vector from baseline data (see methods for details). We found that peak detectability within the first 170 ms of odor response significantly increased between early and late trials (peak early = 31.9 Â± 0.8 mV, late = 40.1 Â± 1.0 mV; p = 4Ã10<sup>â5</sup>, unpaired t-test, n-5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-9" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2H</xref>), while no such significant changes were observed for passive exposure (peak early = 35.3 Â± 0.3 mV, late = 37.1 Â± 1.6 mV; p = 0.06 unpaired t-test, n-5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-10" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). By calculating Euclidean distances between response vectors for CS+ and CSâ stimuli, we also observed a significant increase in discriminability of the two odors across the recording for learning (peak early = 19.8 Â± 1 mV, late = 25.0 Â± 2 mV, p = 5Ã10<sup>â4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-11" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2J</xref>) but not passive mice (peak early = 20.4 Â± 1.9 mV, late = 19.9 Â± 1.3 mV, p = 0.68). Since both discriminability and detectability peaked within 100 ms from odor onset, this enhanced representation occurred within the timescale of the first sniff cycle.</p><p hwp:id="p-16">Thus, diverse response changes specifically occur across learning occurring on the timescale of a single sniff cycle, giving rise to enhanced early odor representation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c" hwp:id="sec-5"><title hwp:id="title-8">Active sampling strategies emerge across task learning</title><p hwp:id="p-17">What are the mechanisms underlying these response changes?

We noted that some mice would respond more eagerly to the CS+ stimulus than others, with larger frequency of anticipatory licking (licking 500-2000 ms after odor onset) in the late trials after learning was complete, while others would wait during the odor stimulus and only lick during the subsequent response period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-10" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3J</xref>).

To test this, we implemented a paradigm in which task engagement could be reversibly changed by physically removing and re-introducing the water reward spout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-1" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), resulting in rapid switches between olfactory behavior and passive exposure as indicated by animal licking responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-2" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 5A</xref> and S8A-B).

In parallel, we found that active sniffing develops across learning in motivated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-15" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3</xref>), which corresponds to changes in odor response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-12" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-8" hwp:rel-id="F5">5</xref>), ultimately serving to improve odor representation. Moreover, we show that this cannot be predicted from simple feed-forward mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-11" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6</xref>), a feature which only holds true during odor sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-13" hwp:rel-id="F7">Figure 7</xref>), and occurs in a cell-type specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-8" hwp:rel-id="F8">Figure 8</xref>).

We show that a portion of the variance in odor sampling strategy can be explained by motivational state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-16" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3J-K</xref>). Thus, active sampling strategies are highly context dependent. Sniff changes will have an overt effect on highly sniff locked cells in absence of olfactory behavior dependent on their feed-forward input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-12" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6C and F</xref>), and an even more profound effect on a wider range of cells if the animal is engaged in odor-directed active sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-13" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6G-H</xref>). As such, the precise effect of sniff changes on mitral/tufted cell activity is itself dependent on behavioral context. Changes in sniffing strategy could therefore provide a common mechanistic basis for a number of different contextual modulations described in OB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Beshel et al., 2007</xref>; Chu et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">Di Prisco and Freeman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">Freeman and Schneider, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Fuentes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">Kay and Laurent, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">Pager et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">Rinberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Doucette and Restrepo 2008</xref>).

This suggests the involvement of top-down centers that serve to coordinate sensory processing at the periphery with the active sampling state of the animal (Wachowiak et al., 2011). Congruently, several neuromodulatory centers which project to the OB interact with respiratory control centers in the brainstem, including serotonergic fibers and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">DuguÃ© and Mainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51" hwp:id="xref-ref-51-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-51">Yackle et al., 2017</xref>). We find a cell-type specificity in the effect of active sampling on response changes congruent with recent imaging across learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52" hwp:id="xref-ref-52-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-52">Yamada et al., 2017</xref>), and neuromodulatory centers have recently been shown to have divergent effects on MCs and TCs â with serotonin having more heterogeneous effects on MCs and TCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">Kapoor et al., 2016</xref>). As such, neuromodulators are a prime candidate to coordinate OB state with active sampling behavior. In the whisker system, cholinergic afferents in the barrel cortex are known to be active during spontaneous whisking and mediate changes in physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Eggermann et al., 2014</xref>), while <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> activation of these afferents boosts sensory input to the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">Bendahmane et al., 2016</xref>).

All mice used were C57BL/6 Jax males aged between 5 and 8 weeks obtained by in house breeding. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri, USA).</p><sec id="s4a" hwp:id="sec-14"><title hwp:id="title-25">Head-fixation</title><p hwp:id="p-59">For surgical procedures, strict sterile technique was adhered to. Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane in 95% oxygen (5% for induction, 1.5-3% for maintenance), and received general analgesia (Carprofen, 5mg/kg s.c.) as well as local analgesia around the dorsal surface of the head (Levobupivicaine or Mepivicaine, 0.5% s.c.). A custom-made stainless steel headplate was affixed to the intraparietal and parietal skull plates with a combination of cyanoacrylate and dental cement, while a recording chamber was constructed upon the bone overlying the right olfactory bulb using a plastic ring and dental cement. The chamber was filled with silicone (Quik-Cast - World Precision Instruments, Florida, USA) and sealed during the recovery and training periods prior to recordings. After 48 hours recovery, mice going on to passive experiments were head-fixed under very light isoflurane anesthezia (identical to the trained mice, see below) and allowed to awaken on a custom-made treadmill. Mice were allowed to accustom themselves to the treadmill in this initial 20 minute session, by the end of which mice showed no stress behavior and learned to walk and sit calmly on the treadmill. Mice going on to behavioral training underwent 2 days of additional water scheduling prior to head-fixation, and in the initial head-fixation session were additionally allowed access to abundant free rewards (diluted sweetened condensed milk) upon licking at the reward spout.</p></sec><sec id="s4b" hwp:id="sec-15"><title hwp:id="title-26">Go/No-Go behavior</title><p hwp:id="p-60">The day following head-fixation habituation, mice undergoing go/no-go training progressed to two more days of pre-training for acquisition of the go/no-go task. On the first day mice were presented only the CS+ odor and were trained to acquire the âgoâ licking pattern following odor offset via a delay classical conditioning procedure. Note that no measure was in place to prevent or punish licking behavior during the odor stimulus, and some mice would additionally lick during the odor stimulus prior to the allotted response time after odor offset (termed âanticipatory lickingâ). Following successful learning of this lick pattern, the next day mice were presented both the CS+ and CSâ on a pseudorandom basis. Mice had to learn to respond to these odors differentially, learning to inhibit responses (âno-goâ behavior) for the CSâ to avoid a 5 s addition to the ITI. Only when mice had successfully demonstrated learning of this task (two consecutive 10-trial blocks of at least 80% correct responses) they were moved on to whole-cell recording procedures the next day. After successful acquisition of a recording, mice were presented a novel pair of odor stimuli assigned each to CS+ or CSâ, and had to learn the go/no-go behavior for these new stimuli. Criterion within a recording was considered one block of at least 80% performance. Learning of the task with the second pair of stimuli was always far more rapid than for the original acquisition (Figure S2B), well within whole-cell recording timescale in awake mice. For mice undergoing the task engagement/disengagement paradigm, acquisition of the task occurred prior to recording such that criterion performance was already achieved from the start of the recording. After 20-30 trials, the water port was manually moved away to disengage the task. Mice would continue to attempt to lick (as detected by infrared beam) for a variable number of trials before âgiving upâ (i.e. 5 consecutive âmissâ trials), after which the port was returned. Often a free reward was used as a salient stimulus to the mouse that the task was re-engaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4c" hwp:id="sec-16"><title hwp:id="title-27">Odor delivery</title><p hwp:id="p-61">Odor stimuli were delivered using a custom-made airflow dilution olfactometer with electronic dilution control. All odor stimuli were calibrated using a mini photoionization detector (miniPID, Aurora Scientific, Ontario, Canada) to form square-pulses of 1% concentration (relative to maximum recorded vapor-pressure in air, Figure S1). Odor stimuli used for initial go/no-go training purposes consisted of peppermint oil and almond oil - components that were not present in the odor mixtures later presented in recordings. For stimuli during whole-cell recordings, 2 were randomly selected from 4 potential odor mixtures (Figure S1), and for behaving mice randomly assigned to CS+ or CSâ. Odor mixtures were comprised of 4 to 6 monomolecular odorants selected for their reported ability to activate dorsal glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>), grouped according to similarity of vapor pressure, and added to the mixture in an undiluted quantity inversely proportional to their relative vapor pressures (Figure S1). Odors were presented with a minimum inter-trial interval of 10 s. To minimize contamination, a high flow clean air stream was passed through the olfactometer manifolds during this time. Constant air-flow going to the animal was achieved using a final valve, minimizing any tactile component accompanying the odor stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4d" hwp:id="sec-17"><title hwp:id="title-28">Whole-cell recordings</title><p hwp:id="p-62">Animals were again anaesthetized under isoflurane as before, and recording chambers were re-opened. A 1-2 mm craniotomy and durectomy was made over the right olfactory bulb. The craniotomy was then covered with a 0.5-1 mm layer of 4% low melting-point agar, which greatly contributed to the stability of recordings. This layer was removed and re-applied after every descent of a recording micropipette. The recording chamber was then filled with cortex buffer (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose), and the mice were transitioned to head-fixation and allowed 30 minutes to recover from anesthezia. After this time, behaving animals would demonstrate retention of go/no-go behavior acquired the day previously prior to attempt for a recording. Micropipettes were prepared with a resistance of 5-8 MÎ© from borosilicate glass (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) capillaries, and filled with intracellular solution (130 mM KMeSO4, 10 mM HEPES, 7 mM KCl, 2 mM ATP-Na, 2 mM ATP-Mg, 0.5 mM GTP, 0.05 mM EGTA, and in some cases 10 mM biocytin). Signals were amplified using an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Molecular devices â West Berkshire, UK) and digitized by a Micro 1401 (Cambridge Electronic Design â Cambridge, UK) at 25 kHz. Drift in membrane potential, corrected for by spike thresholds, between the start and end of recordings was 0.9Â±1 mV, with an average duration of 14Â±4 minutes, and access resistance of 36Â±19 MÎ©.</p></sec><sec id="s4e" hwp:id="sec-18"><title hwp:id="title-29">Sniff measurement</title><p hwp:id="p-63">Sniffing behavior was recorded either with a pressure sensor or flow sensor (Sensortechnics â Rugby, UK), externally located in close proximity to the left naris (contralateral to recording side).

After the head-plate surgery, a double tracheotomy was performed by exposing the trachea and inserting two catheters, one directed to the lungs through which the mouse could freely breathe, and the other directed to the nasal passages through which flow was controlled. To mimic sniffing, a peristaltic pump (Ismatec, Wertheim, Germany) was used to generate flow inward through the nares, with a flow controller to buffer out fluctuations and the periodic opening of a 3-way valve used to simulate regular inhalations, either at 3.3 Hz (100 ms opening times), or 6.6 Hz (50 ms opening times).</p></sec><sec id="s4g" hwp:id="sec-20"><title hwp:id="title-31">Neuronal numbers</title><p hwp:id="p-65">Altogether we report here recordings from 66 mitral and tufted cells.

None of these cohorts are overlapping. Of the cells from mice across learning, 2 were excluded from any sniff analysis due to poor sniff signals (resulting in 38 cell-odor pairs, 20 accompanied by small (&lt;20 ms) sniff changes, 18 by large sniff changes), and 2 were excluded similarly from the passively exposed dataset (42 cell-odor pairs).</p></sec><sec id="s4h" hwp:id="sec-21"><title hwp:id="title-32">Data analysis</title><p hwp:id="p-66">All data was pre-processed in Spike2 version 7.1 (Cambridge Electronic Design â Cambridge, UK) and analyzed in Matlab 2015b (Mathworks - Massachusetts, USA) and R using custom scripts and functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4i" hwp:id="sec-22"><title hwp:id="title-33">Statistics</title><p hwp:id="p-67">In all cases, 5-95% confidence intervals were used to determine significance unless otherwise stated.

Where these are preceded by âSDâ, the p-value refers to the variances rather than the averages of the datasets. Means and error bars showing a single standard deviation either side are used in all cases for normally distributed data of equal variance. Two-sided Studentâs t-tests were used for comparison of means and Bartlett tests used to compare variances, unless otherwise stated. Boxplots are used to represent any other data (data comparisons of unequal variance, or non-normally distributed data), where median is plotted as a line within a box formed from 25<sup>th</sup> (q1) and 75<sup>th</sup> (q3) percentile. Points are drawn as outliers if they are larger than q3 + 1.5 Ã (q3 â q1) or smaller than q1 â 1.5 Ã (q3 â q1). For such data, Ranksum tests were used to compare the medians, and Browne-Forsythe tests used to compare variance, unless otherwise stated. To determine points of significant difference between cumulative histograms, a bootstrapping method was used. Firstly, data underlying the two histograms would be shuffled between datasets, and cumulative histograms would be calculated from these shuffled sets. The difference at each point between the two histograms would then be calculated. This was repeated 10,000 times, and the differences between the real cumulative histograms would then be compared to the shuffled distribution at each point. An arrow was drawn on the points at which the actual difference exceeded the 99th percentile of the shuffled distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4j" hwp:id="sec-23"><title hwp:id="title-34">Sniffing analysis</title><p hwp:id="p-68">To extract inhalation durations, firstly inhalation peaks were detected as any peak above a certain threshold set according to the amplitude of the signal. Inhalation onset was set at the nearest point pre-peak that the flow trace crossed zero, while inhalation offset was set at the nearest point post-peak that the flow trace crossed zero. The distance between these points was taken as the inhalation duration. The mean inhalation duration for the first 500ms of each odor presentation was calculated from the duration of all complete inhalations within that time period.</p></sec><sec id="s4k" hwp:id="sec-24"><title hwp:id="title-35">Principal cell identification</title><p hwp:id="p-69">Mitral and tufted cells were distinguished from interneurons as previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">Kollo et al., 2014</xref>).

Morphologies from the current data set were acquired as previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">Kollo et al., 2014</xref>): mice were perfused following recordings with cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed olfactory bulbs were embedded in porcine gelatin (10% wt/vol), before being fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. The OBs were then cut into 150 Î¼m slices with a vibratome (Thermo Scientific â Massachusetts, USA) and stained with avidin-biotinylated peroxidase (ABC kit â Vector Labs, California, USA) and the DAB reaction. Biocytin-stained cells were traced using a Neurolucida system (MBF Bioscience, Vermont, USA). Principal cells were identified via soma size, cell body location with respect to the mitral cell layer, an apical dendrite reaching the glomerular layer and lateral dendrites branching in the external plexiform layer. MCs were distinguished from TCs based on proximity to the mitral cell layer.</p></sec><sec id="s4l" hwp:id="sec-25"><title hwp:id="title-36">Odor responses and changes</title><p hwp:id="p-70">For all analyses, the first presentation of each odor was excluded due to the elicitation of high frequency sniffing by the novel odorant, which rapidly decayed by the second presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">Wesson et al., 2008</xref>). <bold>General response calculations</bold>: All traces were aligned to first inhalation onset following final valve opening. For V<sub>m</sub> response calculations, spike waveforms, including the AHP, were subtracted from the V<sub>m</sub> trace (â5 to 20 ms after spike peak). Responses for each trial were calculated as the mean V<sub>m</sub> within the first 500 ms post odor onset, normalized to the baseline membrane potential in the 2 s prior to odor onset. FR responses were calculated as the mean number of spikes per 0.25 s time bin in the first 500 ms post odor onset, normalized to that calculated for 2 s prior to odor onset. Significant responses were determined for both V<sub>m</sub> and FR using a paired t-test to compare baseline and odor-evoked activity for all trials. <bold>For response changes across learning</bold>: Significant changes between early and late trials for each odor response were identified by comparing the five âearly trialsâ in block 1 (stimulus presentation #2 to 6), with the 5 last presentations of the stimulus (âlate trialsâ). Significant change was determined using an unpaired t-test, p&lt;0.05. <bold>To determine onset of response change</bold>: For each response, the mean V<sub>m</sub> response waveform calculated for early trials was subtracted from that calculated from late trials, to generate a response change waveform at each time-point from odor onset. This was then normalised by the standard deviation of this resulting waveform during the baseline period 2 s prior to odor onset. Response change onset was detected where the response change magnitude first exceeded 2 standard deviations and remained there for at least 50 ms. <bold>For task engagement/disengagement changes</bold>: The first 500 ms of the stimulus was analyzed for V<sub>m</sub> responses, and the full 2 s for FR responses. 5 trials of initial engagement were defined as the last 5 trials of each stimulus prior to physical port removal, disengagement trials were defined as 5 trials with at least 3 consecutive misses within the block, and re-engagement trials were based on the first 5 trials of the stimulus after the mouse initiates licking after port return.</p></sec><sec id="s4m" hwp:id="sec-26"><title hwp:id="title-37">Detectability and discriminability analysis</title><p hwp:id="p-71">For each response, five mean V<sub>m</sub> response waveforms were generated from different sets of 3 early trials, 3 mid-point trials (mid-point trial Â± 2 trials either side) and 3 late trials (aligned to first inhalation post odor onset). 3 early, 3 mid-point, and 3 late corresponding mean baseline waveforms were made by averaging inhalation-triggered waveforms from the ITI. Population response vectors were then constructed from these mean response waveforms for all cell-odor pairs recorded. At each time point relative to inhalation onset, the Euclidean distance was calculated between response and baseline vectors, and this was repeated five times for each baseline vector to gain a mean detectability over time, and a standard deviation. Minimum detection times were calculated as the first time post-inhalation where the mean detectability exceeded 2.5 Ã the SD of the baseline mean detectability, and remained so for at least 50 ms. The average baseline Euclidean distance 200 ms prior to odor onset was subtracted from the trace, normalizing the baseline to zero. Peaks of detectability were defined as the maximum detectability within the first 170 ms after odor onset. Discriminability was analyzed similarly, however the response vectors used to calculate the Euclidean distances were calculated between CS+ and CSâ mean V<sub>m</sub> response waveforms for the five sets of early, mid-point and late trials, i.e. the Euclidean distance was generated between population responses for CS+ and CSâ separately.</p></sec><sec id="s4n" hwp:id="sec-27"><title hwp:id="title-38">Sniff-V<sub>m</sub> modulation amplitudes and preferences</title><p hwp:id="p-72">The sniff-V<sub>m</sub> modulation properties of each cell were calculated as previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>). <bold>Baseline sniff-V<sub>m</sub> modulation:</bold> due to the high variability of sniff behavior in awake mice, analysis was restricted to sniff cycles between 0.25 and 0.3s in duration, where also the preceding sniff cycle was within this range. Mean V<sub>m</sub> from the spike-subtracted V<sub>m</sub> trace was taken as a function of sniff cycle phase for at least 150 sniffs, and this was plotted as Cartesian coordinates. The angle of the mean vector calculated by averaging these Cartesian coordinates was taken as the phase preference of the cell, while the difference between the mean V<sub>m</sub> at the preferred phase, and the minimum value on the mean V<sub>m</sub> waveform was taken as the amplitude of modulation. <bold>Odor sniff-V<sub>m</sub> modulation:</bold> This was calculated as for baseline, but based on the first four sniffs post odor onset for the 10 trials of lowest sniff rates. As odor responses can have both tonic and sniff-modulated components, the phase-V<sub>m</sub> trace for each sniff had to be normalized according to the linear vector connecting the V<sub>m</sub> at the beginning and end of the sniff. To determine significance, a bootstrapping method was used: 100 ms segments of V<sub>m</sub> data were randomly selected for each cell and connected to form a shuffled dataset. The phase analysis was then performed on these shuffled datasets, and a modulation amplitude calculated and this was repeated 100 times. Significant modulation was assigned when the actual modulation amplitude exceeded that of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of shuffled data amplitudes.</p></sec><sec id="s4o" hwp:id="sec-28"><title hwp:id="title-39">Putative mitral cell versus tufted cell identification</title><p hwp:id="p-73">For each ITI, the mean V<sub>m</sub> was calculated during sniffs of duration of &lt;200 ms where also the preceding sniff was within this duration range (âfast sniffsâ).

The difference between the probability of licking for CS+ and CSâ for each time window was calculated, and the leading edge of the first window at which this calculated difference significantly deviated from the values calculated from the 2 s window prior to odor onset was considered the reaction time (Figure S2C). <bold>From sniff behavior</bold>: Inhalation and exhalation duration values were calculated for CS+ and CSâ as a function of sniff number from odor onset.

This was then normalized by the standard deviation of this resulting waveform during the baseline period 2 s prior to odor onset. Response change onset was detected where the response change magnitude first exceeded 2 standard deviations and remained there for at least 50 ms. To determine the effect of sniff changes on response onset, only the first inhalation after odor onset was considered, since only response onsets â¤250 ms â within the first sniff cycle â were analyzed. For each response, trials were categorized into âslowâ (&gt;90 ms inhalation duration) or âfastâ (&lt;90 ms) sniff trials. The mean normalized V<sub>m</sub> response waveform was averaged across these trials. Response onsets were calculated as before using these waveforms. Only cases where there were 5 or more trials in each category were analyzed. Cases where the mean 500 ms V<sub>m</sub> response for either slow or fast sniffs was less than 0.5 mV in amplitude were also discarded. Response onsets from fast vs. slow trials were then compared across all responses for either behaving or passive mitral/tufted cells only to determine the effect of sniffing within each group. Response onsets were then compared between passive and behaving mitral/tufted cells for either slow or fast sniffs only, to determine any effect of behavioral state independent of sniff duration. To determine significant differences, a paired T-test was implemented for slow vs fast sniff groups within passive or behaving cohorts, or Ranksum tests were used when comparing between passive and behaving cohorts.</p></sec></sec></back></article>
