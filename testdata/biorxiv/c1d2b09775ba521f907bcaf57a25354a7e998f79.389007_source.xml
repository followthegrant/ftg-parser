Prebiotics are dietary compounds that may shift these conditions towards health by promoting the growth of beneficial microbes. Pigs fed a diet amended with 5% resistant potato starch (RPS) exhibited alterations associated with gut health relative to swine fed an unamended diet (CON). RPS intake increased abundances of anaerobic <italic toggle="yes">Clostridia</italic> in feces and several tissues, as well as intestinal concentrations of butyrate. Functional gene amplicons suggested bacteria similar to <italic toggle="yes">Anaerostipes hadrus</italic> were stimulated by RPS intake. The CON treatment exhibited increased abundances of several genera of <italic toggle="yes">Proteobacteria</italic> (which utilize respiratory metabolisms) in several location. RPS intake increased the abundance of regulatory T cells in the cecum, but not periphery, and cecal immune status alterations were indicative of enhanced mucosal defenses. A network analysis of host and microbial changes in the cecum revealed that regulatory T cells positively correlated with butyrate concentration, luminal IgA concentration, expression of IL-6 and DEF1B, and several mucosa-associated bacterial taxa. Thus, the administration of RPS modulated the microbiota and host response, improved cecal barrier function, promoted immunological tolerance, and reduced the niche for bacterial respiration.</p><sec hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Importance</title><p hwp:id="p-3">The gut microbiota is central to host health. Many disease states and disorders appear to arise from interactions between the gut microbial community and host immune system. As a result, methods and interventions to support the growth and activity of beneficial gut microbes are being actively pursued. Feeding the gut microbiota with dietary compounds, known as prebiotics, is one of the most promising ways to support gut health. Here we describe a successful prebiotic intervention in weaning swine, a relevant translational model for human health. This work unites microbial and immunological data and demonstrates one way a prebiotic intervention can play out for the benefit of the host.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-3">Keywords</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">resistant starch</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">mucosa</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">microbial accessible carbohydrates</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">butyrate</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">microbiota</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-6">microbial respiration</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-7">prebiotics</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-8">t-regulatory cells</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-9">colonization resistance</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-10">mucosal barrier</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-11">immune tolerance</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="36"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-4">Introduction</title><p hwp:id="p-4">Dietary prebiotics, such as resistant starches, provide an attractive alternative to antibiotics for improved animal health, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>). Resistant starches are compounds that are not digested by the host in the small intestine, thereby arriving in the large intestine as microbial-accessible carbohydrates. Bacteria that consume resistant starches are normal members of the microbiota and are associated with intestinal health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>). Without access to diet-derived carbohydrates, bacteria will harvest host-derived sugars from the intestinal mucus layer, compromising barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>). However, if dietary carbohydrates are accessible, bacteria will ferment these compounds and release beneficial metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Host cells consume the vast majority of microbial-produced SCFAs, fueling intestinal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-5">The SCFA butyrate is a central metabolite for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. It is the preferred fuel source for colonocytes, which oxidize butyrate and consume oxygen. This oxygen consumption lowers the oxygen potential of the epithelia, reducing the amount of electron acceptors available for bacterial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>). Furthermore, butyrate can help to limit immune activation by enhancing mucosal barrier function and immunological tolerance, reducing the secretion of immune-derived reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which also can be used in microbial respiration. Butyrate benefits mucosal barrier function by stimulating increased secretion of mucus, antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>), and IgA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>), therefore preventing the translocation of intestinal bacteria that would elicit an immune response. Second, butyrate can induce a more tolerant immune phenotype through the generation of several regulatory immune cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>). In total, butyrate-driven changes to the gut microenvironment limit the niche for microbes with respiratory metabolisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>), allowing microbes that specialize in fermentation to outcompete those that respire, such as <italic toggle="yes">Campylobacter, Salmonella</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-6">Dietary intake of resistant starches may make the intestinal ecosystem less hospitable for potential pathogens and limit the negative impact of weaning on mammalian health. For example, feeding resistant potato starch (RPS) to nursery-aged piglets enhances some markers of gut health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which RPS supports intestinal health in the weaned mammal are poorly defined. The results reported here suggest that dietary RPS encouraged beneficial host-microbe interactions in the hindgut ecosystem. Specifically, RPS stimulated bacterial food webs with functional activities for increased SCFA and butyrate production, which caused subsequent changes in the host intestinal immune status. Immune changes included increased T-regulatory cell types in the cecal tissues, markers of enhanced mucosal barrier function, and reduced amounts of potentially harmful bacteria known to utilize respiratory metabolisms. Collectively, dietary RPS given to pigs at weaning modulated bacterial populations and host immune status to a state associated with enhanced intestinal health.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-5">Results</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-6">No overt differences in health were observed between the two treatment groups</title><p hwp:id="p-7">All pigs appeared healthy throughout the study with no obvious differences in health or behavior observed between the groups.

Group fecal bacterial community structures did not differ significantly until day 15, which was associated with a recent dietary phase change (12 days post-weaning), marked by a decrease in the amount of dietary lactose (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, Table S3</bold>).

The large inter-individual variation present in the intestinal microbiota of mammals is well documented, swine included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>).

This phenomenon was also observed in the present study, as we detected variation in the response of individual pigs to RPS. Therefore, to optimize the effect of dietary prebiotics it may be necessary to ensure that the appropriate microbial food webs are present in the host. One study suggests that co-administration of resistant starch and a probiotic strain of <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacteria</italic> spp. produced more desirable health outcomes than resistant starch alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>). Our work identifies swine gut microbiota members that could be co-administered alongside RPS to potentially enhance its beneficial effects.</p><p hwp:id="p-30">RPS-associated bacterial food webs were composed of organisms known to use fermentative metabolisms. Well-known fermenters such as <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacteria</italic> spp. and <italic toggle="yes">Faecalibacterium</italic> spp. were enriched in the RPS-fed animals and are associated with intestinal health in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref>), and other studies have shown increased abundance of these genera in pigs fed resistant starch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>). Some genera enriched in the RPS-fed animals are not well characterized for their health benefits. For example, members of the genus <italic toggle="yes">Clostridium sensu stricto 1</italic> are not generally associated with positive health outcomes; however, our data suggest that members of this genus may be important for resistant starch degradation in the distal gut. Many of the differences between the treatment groups were likely a result of feedback interactions between intestinal bacterial metabolites and host tissues. Butyrate (and other SCFAs) produced by gut bacteria is oxidized by host tissues, thereby limiting the amount of oxygen available at the mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>). This establishes a mucosal environment favoring microbial fermentation over respiration, and therefore more SCFA production. Increased mucosal tolerance additionally limits the release of immune-associated electron acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>). In total these effects limit the niche for microbial respiration, and the types of bacteria enriched in the RPS-fed animals compared to the CON-fed animals are consistent with this model.</p><p hwp:id="p-31">Increases in beneficial bacterial populations and metabolites in the RPS-fed animals were associated with positive impacts on the mucosal barrier as well as increased immune regulatory cells in the cecum. The results showed that RPS-associated microbial changes enhanced the mucosal barrier by increasing the expression of MUC2, IL-6, and DEFB1 in the cecal mucosa. IL-6 has recently been shown to be critical for maintaining the mucosal barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref>) and has also been shown to be important for strong IgA responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref>). T cell subtypes, in particular T-regulatory cells (T-regs), and indicators of intestinal health and mucosal barrier function significantly correlated with microbial butyrate and caproate production, as well as several anaerobic <italic toggle="yes">Clostridial</italic> OTUs in the cecal mucosa of the RPS-fed animals. Butyrate is known to induce <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> generation and expansion of peripheral T-regs (reviewed in Zeng et. al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref>)), which are critical for intestinal homeostasis and gut barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>). T-regs moderate immune responses to commensal microbes, reducing intestinal inflammation and subsequent mucosal availability of immune-derived electron acceptors, thereby limiting microbial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>). T-regs can promote mucosal IgA responses, helping the host exert control over its microbial partners (23, 32, 33), and cecal luminal IgA levels were increased in RPS-fed pigs and correlated with the abundance CD4<sup>+</sup> T-regulatory cells. CD8α<sup>+</sup> T-regulatory cells (CD4<sup>−</sup> CD8α<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>+</sup>) are less well studied than CD4<sup>+</sup> T-regs, but recent work indicates they are an important regulatory cell type in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">34</xref>), and we detected these cells in the cecum of pigs. Though their direct role in intestinal health is unclear, the network analysis suggests that animals with greater relative abundance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-regs correlated with greater expression of DEFB1.</p><p hwp:id="p-32">Though they were healthy, the CON group exhibited markers of reduced immune tolerance and greater abundances of potentially invasive bacteria in their mucosal tissues. Specifically, CON-fed animals had more cytotoxic T cells (CD8α<sup>+</sup> cell types) compared to RPS-fed pigs, although they were unlikely active given the lack of pathological changes in the cecum. Similarly, bacteria enriched in the CON animals have previously been associated with intestinal inflammation, dysbiosis in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref>), and utilize respiration as their preferred metabolism.

In the cecal tissue network analysis, many nodes residing in subnetwork B were equally represented in both the CON and RPS groups. For example, double-positive (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8α<sup>+</sup>) CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells were prominent members of subnetwork B and were not differentially abundant between treatments; these cells have been shown to be common in swine and represent activated, memory effector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">38</xref>).

Finally, pigs are recognized as a relevant translational model for human health, and research to enhance intestinal health in pigs provides insights for enhancing human health as well.</p></sec><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-12"><title hwp:id="title-14">Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s5a" hwp:id="sec-13"><title hwp:id="title-15">Experimental design</title><p hwp:id="p-35">Ten pregnant, Large White crossbred sows were delivered two weeks prior to farrowing, and farrowed onsite.

Treatment groups consisted of two pens of seven piglets for a total of 14 piglets in each treatment group, each group had equal representation from all litters. The control group (CON) continued to receive non-amended Phase 1 Starter Diet. The treatment group was fed Phase 1 Starter Diet amended with 5% raw potato starch (RPS; MSP Starch Products Inc., Carberry, Manitoba, Canada).
