While changes in tendon structure have been linked with tendinopathy, the effects of distance running on tendon structure is not well understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize structural differences in the Achilles tendons in healthy young adults and competitive distance runners using quantitative ultrasound analyses. We hypothesized that competitive distance runners with no clinical signs or symptoms of tendinopathy would have quantitative signs of tendon damage, characterized by decreased collagen alignment and echogenicity, in addition to previous reports of thicker tendons. Longitudinal ultrasound images of the right Achilles tendon mid-substance were acquired in competitive distance runners and recreationally-active adults. Collagen organization, mean echogenicity, and tendon thickness were quantified using image processing techniques. Clinical assessments confirmed that runners had no signs or symptoms of tendinopathy and controls were only included if they had no history of Achilles tendon pain or injuries. Runner tendons were 40% less organized, 48% thicker, and 41% less echogenic compared to the control tendons (p &lt; 0.001). Young adults engaged in competitive distance-running have structurally different tendons than recreationally-active young adults. While these structural differences have been associated with tendon damage, the lack of clinical symptoms of tendinopathy may suggest that these detected differences may either be precursors of tendinopathy development or protective adaptations to cyclic tendon loading experienced during running.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Key Terms</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">Achilles tendon</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">tendinopathy</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">ultrasound</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">running</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">collagen alignment</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-3">Introduction</title><p hwp:id="p-3">Mid-substance Achilles tendinopathy is among the most commonly reported injuries in running athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>]. Repetitive tendon loading as high as 12 times body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>] is thought to elicit structural changes observed in tendinopathy development.

All subjects met several inclusion criteria: no Achilles tendon pain at or three months prior to the initial evaluation, no history of partial or complete tendon rupture, and ability to perform single leg hops on both sides. Age, sex, height, and weight were collected from all subjects. In addition to demographics, other information was collected from the runner group: a clinical outcome questionnaire (VISA-A), self-reported running foot-strike pattern, lower-extremity injury history, years participated in collegiate cross country and/or track and field. All competitive-distance runners participated on an NCAA cross-country team and images were acquired during a single session prior to the start of the competitive season. Individuals with clinical signs of tendinopathy identified through qualitative ultrasonography assessments and self-reported clinical outcomes and excluded from analysis. Longitudinal B-mode ultrasound images of the right Achilles tendon were acquired while subjects lay prone on a treatment table with the anterior aspect of the shank resting on the table and feet hanging off the table in the resting position. These images were acquired at the mid-substance of the Achilles tendon, approximately 4 cm proximal to the calcaneal insertion, using an 18 MHz transducer (L18-10L30H-4, SmartUs, TELEMED, Vilnius, Lithuania) with a scanning width of 3 cm (scan parameters: Dynamic Range: 72dB; gain: 47 dB).

Briefly, a computational analogue for crossed polarizer imaging was employed to quantify collagen fascicles alignment of the mid-substance of the Achilles tendon. Fascicles are hyperechoic compared to the hypoechoic extracellular matrix which gives tendon a banded appearance. The orientations of these bands were determined and the distribution was calculated as a circular standard deviation (CSD). Lower CSD values represent more aligned – or organized – collagen fascicles; conversely, higher CSD values indicate less organized fascicles.

Secondary analyses were performed to determine if other runner characteristics, sex, BMI, self-reported foot-strike pattern (forefoot, mid-foot, and rearfoot), and years running at the collegiate level explained measurements of collagen organization.

Specifically, ultrasound analyses of the Achilles tendon mid-substance highlights reduced collagen alignment and echogenicity and increased tendon thickness in competitive-distance runners. Compromised tendon material properties are partly mitigated by tendon thickening in individuals with Achilles tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>], suggesting a compensatory response to maintain tendon strain during high-stress activities. These differences in tendon structure are not explained with risk factors commonly associated with musculoskeletal pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>] such as sex, BMI, or foot-strike pattern (R<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.01). Additionally, less-variable tendon structure in runners compared to controls suggests that these structural changes may be highly dependent on the biomechanical demands placed on tendon, which is similar amongst distance runners on the same team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-18">Differences in Achilles tendon structure observed in this study agree with prior reports of Achilles tendinopathy development and progression and adds new insights into the differences that exist between populations. This cross-sectional study quantified tendon structure of competitive-distance runners at a single time point just prior to the start of a competitive season. Although distance runners are at a 10-fold risk of developing tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>], the majority of runners never report symptoms or pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>]. Therefore, we propose two divergent structural responses to the biomechanical rigors of distance running: habituated tendon and symptomatic tendon. Our results suggest that cyclic tendon loads elicit structural changes in the tendon, which have been linked with decreased tendon properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>]. Tendon hypertrophy appears to mitigate decreases in tendon material properties as large as 51% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>]. However, it remains unclear as to what sustained biomechanical environment results in symptomatic or habituated and pain-free tendons. Training and exercise has been shown to increase tendon thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref>], and elevated levels of peritendinous collagen synthesis are responses to short term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref>] and long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>] exercise. Thus, targeted interventions that improve healing responses and beneficial remodeling may mitigate the risks of developing tendinopathy during high-risk activities such as distance running.</p><p hwp:id="p-19">Our findings suggest that cyclic tendon loading, experienced during distance running, drives changes in tendon structure without leading to symptoms of tendinopathy. This is highlighted by the low variance in collagen alignment measured in runners (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-3" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), which may be a normal response to the cyclic loading experienced during distance running. Achilles tendon stiffness also scales with plantarflexor strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>], suggesting that the tendon undergoes remodeling as a protective mechanism against excessive strain in order to maintain good health. In addition, the absence of painful symptoms, neovascularization, and perceived functional deficits in the runners indicates a lack of pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-7" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-20">Reliable and non-invasive techniques that quantify tendon collagen organization provide opportunities to develop imaging biomarkers that could forecast the development of symptomatic tendinopathy. Currently, tendinopathy is difficult to predict and only detected after symptoms manifest, at which point, treating the condition are not always successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref>]. Shear-wave elastography detects changes in the mechanical properties of an affected tendon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>] but requires specialized imaging equipment not available in all clinical settings. Other techniques correlate tendon tension with the speed at which sound travels through tendon, but these measures do not directly assess structural changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref>]. In contrast, quantifying collagen alignment using ultrasonography only requires a B-mode ultrasound image that any sonographer or physician could acquire without additional training or specialized equipment available in most sports medicine practices.</p><p hwp:id="p-21">There are some key limitations to consider for this study. The competitive-runners were collegiate athletes and therefore did not vary greatly in age, BMI, or years running at the collegiate level. While previous work has shown that these factors are not correlated with the development of tendinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>], the lack of correlation between these factors and the CSD observed in this study could be partially attributed to the low variability. Achilles tendon function was not quantitatively assessed, instead we collected VISA-A scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">36</xref>] in the competitive-runners and clinically analyzed ultrasound images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-8" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>] to confirm that no underlying tendinopathy was present. A functional task such as a single leg heel-raise or a maximal plantarflexion contraction normalized between subjects could be more sensitive to changes in function than a qualitative questionnaire, but the time constraints of this study prevented more thorough biomechanical assessments. However, asymptomatic tendinopathy has not been linked to losses in plantarflexor function, and good clinical outcomes reported by the runners suggests that these structural changes did not lead to a perceived loss in functional ability.</p><p hwp:id="p-22">In conclusion, young adults who participate in competitive-distance running have structurally different tendons than recreationally-active young adults. These differences do not appear to be correlated with age, sex, BMI, self-reported foot-strike pattern, or years running at the collegiate level. It remains unclear if these measurements of decreased tendon organization predict tendinopathy symptoms; however, trained runners are at an 10-times increased risk of Achilles tendon injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref>]. The non-invasive imaging technique used to quantify tendon structure can be used to track changes in tendon structure and better characterize the progression of tendinopathy. Prospectively quantifying tendon structure throughout a training season of distance running may identify imaging biomarkers that can predict painful tendinopathy before symptoms manifest.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-7">Acknowledgments</title><p hwp:id="p-23">We would like to thank Annelise Slater for assistance in data collection.
