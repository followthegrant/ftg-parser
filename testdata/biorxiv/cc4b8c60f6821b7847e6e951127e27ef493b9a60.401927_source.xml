The urban exposome framework constitutes a novel approach in tackling city-wide challenges, such as those of drinking-water quality. In this study, we presented part of the urban exposome of Limassol (Cyprus) focusing on chemical and microbial drinking-water quality parameters and their association with urban neighborhood indicators. A perceptions study and an urban population study was conducted. We mapped the water quality parameters and participants’ opinions on city life (i.e. neighborhood life, health care and green space access) using quarters (small administrative areas) as the reference unit of the city. In an exploratory environment-wide association study analysis, we used all variables (questionnaire responses and water quality metrics) to describe correlations between them accounting, also, for self-reported health status. Overall, urban drinking-water quality using conventional indicators of chemical (disinfection byproducts-trihalomethanes) and microbial (coliforms, E. coli, and Enterococci) quality did not raise particular concerns. The general health and chronic health status of the urban participants was not significantly (all &gt;FDR corrected p value of 0.1) associated with any urban life variables. However, correlations between trihalomethanes and participant characteristics (e.g. household cleaning, drinking water habits) were documented. This study showed the potential of using integrative approaches to develop urban exposomic profiles and identifying within-city differentiated environmental and health indicators. The characterization of the urban exposome of Limassol will be expanded via the inclusion of biomonitoring tools and untargeted metabolomics platforms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Keywords</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">exposome</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">urban health</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">environment-wide association</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">water quality</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">perceptions</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-6">indicators</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-7">population health</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-8">small area</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="35"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

Defining the exposome along with the advances in methodologies for high throughput analysis in shorter time has also redefined the study paradigm in environmental health. Thus, decoding the exposome will not benefit only environmental health, but it will lead to better understanding of disease development and progress. Additionally, it fosters innovation in exposure assessment, and it allows for intra- and inter-disciplinary approaches in public health to become more widespread than they are now. Within this context, more “exposomes” have been defined to address different totalities and with different units of reference (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>–<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-4">Cities are dynamic and complex systems that will become the future focus of public health systems, because they currently host more than half of the global population and generate &gt;80% of the global GDP (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>). Thus, cities are the main unit of reference for the urban exposome which can be seen in terms similar to the human exposome, as the totality of indicators (quantitative or qualitative) that shape up the quality of life and health of urban populations (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>). In this context, the urban exposome, defined as the continuous monitoring of urban health indicators which refer to external and internal to the city parameters, is not merely the sum of individual exposures, but places cities in the center of an urban-oriented study framework, i.e. that of the urban exposome (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>). In the urban exposome framework, the quality of life in urban centers is concurrently assessed along with other indicators, such as water quality, or prevalence/incidence of communicable and non-communicable diseases.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">The value of clean water in public health is historically acknowledged at all societal levels. As more people nowadays live in cities, easy access to safe and affordable water is becoming more important in eliminating possible within-city health and societal disparities.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">Besides the technical provisions to maintain water of good quality, the uninterrupted availability of water becomes an issue due to climate change manifestations, especially in areas that are now or expected to be hit harder by extended droughts and other related meteorological phenomena. Europe, overall, is expected to face increases in both the extent of geographical areas affected by droughts and in the duration of such climatic events (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>). Within this context, cities located in the Southeast Europe and the Mediterranean region are predicted to face challenges in maintaining ample water availability and excellent water quality in the future (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-7">The biological and societal networks in an urban setting that emerge from various aspects of climate change, water availability, water quality and population health are becoming increasingly complex to solely rely upon classical urban health approaches. Cities and their smaller areas (i.e. neighborhoods, or small areas) are warranted to address water-related issues, such as water demand, safety, security and quality issues, while tackling societal inequalities and health disparities. In this context, the concept of the urban exposome is introduced to help scientists and policy makers to better articulate the framework of the systematic spatio-temporal surveillance and monitoring of a city’s heterogeneous health profile. The urban exposome is central to better understanding urban health dynamics and goes beyond the human exposome framework, which is instrumental in personal health assessment or identifying risk factors for different health outcomes in population studies. The aim of this study was to map different indicators of the urban exposome that mostly related to drinking water and quality of life as part of a larger study that was set up a case study to present the application of the urban exposome framework in the city of Limassol, Cyprus.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Limassol is a coastal city, the biggest port of Cyprus, and it is defined as a medium-sized city (~200000 inhabitants according to the 2011 Population Census of Cyprus) (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>,<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>), currently facing rapid economic development. Half of the urban population of the urban area of Limassol resides within the municipality of Limassol (~110000 inhabitants) in the center of the city. The objective of this study was to describe the water quality and aspects of quality of life following the integrative urban exposome framework in the municipality of Limassol, having quarters (small within-municipality administrative areas) as the unit of reference. This urban study was <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> designed without a hypothesis-testing, one exposure-one outcome approach, because of the inherent nature of the urban exposome framework that relies upon a hypothesis-generating scope, instead. Our intention was to provide a practical example of how the urban exposome framework could be used to study drinking water quality aspects in a dynamic urban setting of a typical mid-sized city.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><label>2.</label><title hwp:id="title-4">Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><label>2.1.</label><title hwp:id="title-5">Application of the urban exposome in the municipality of Limassol, Cyprus</title><p hwp:id="p-9">We have previously described the urban exposome as all indicators that need to be continuously monitored for the assessment of city health [10]. The urban exposome focuses on cities and their geographic (sub)areas as the study units and it parallels the human exposome characteristics [10]. Within the framework of the urban exposome, external to the city parameters that cannot be influenced by the city itself can be either general (e.g. global trends and policy decisions) or more specific (e.g. climate change impacts, demographic changes, culture). It follows that internal parameters are those that are integral to the city, such as infrastructure, built/neighborhood environment and determinants of population health (e.g. socioeconomic factors). An exposome-based study was conducted in summer 2017 to describe the water quality aspects of the urban exposome of Limassol, following an integrative and interdisciplinary approach (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

The questions asked during the face-to-face interviews and the questionnaire for the municipality officers focused on the identification of trends shaping the city of Limassol, assessment of the climate change manifestations and their impact, scoring of environmental health concerns, an assessment of what was believed to be the citizens major health threats with regards to urban life, and perspectives about future opportunities to improve health in the city. The questionnaire administered to the citizens included various questions on climate change perceptions, environmental concerns in general, health perceptions and perceptions about drinking-water quality.

The first 20 parameters ranked by the FDR adjusted p-value can be found in Supplementary Information <bold>(Table S</bold> 5).</p><p hwp:id="p-53">The results of the second EWAS analysis and the correlation between the variables used in the PLS-DA models were summarized in the circular plots (circo plots) of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-1" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 5</xref>. Again, all three outcomes were used, however, the model for the chronic disease did not converge and thus, the plot is not presented. For the other two outcomes the associations between the variables were not the same, as expected due to the difference in the outcomes between the two models. The THM variables correlated with each other and with the cleaning activities as it was also shown in the simple correlation plots. The correlations were less in number when the outcome was “any disease the past year” compared to the correlations visualized in the circo plot of the “general health” as an outcome. Additionally, different levels of the predictor variables were noted depending on the outcome, as it can be seen by the lines that are on the space outside the circular plot. These lines, however, were not used for interpretation due to the study’s exploratory nature to avoid any misleading inferences.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F5" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-5-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;401927v1/FIG5</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F5</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig5</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption hwp:id="caption-11"><p hwp:id="p-54">Circular plots of the correlations between the variables used in the environmental-wide analysis by block/group of variables.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="401927_fig5" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-12"/><graphic xlink:href="401927_fig5a" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-13"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-20"><label>4.</label><title hwp:id="title-28">Discussion</title><p hwp:id="p-55">This is the first application of the urban exposome framework study in a medium-sized European city, Limassol, Cyprus that agnostically addressed and synthesized evidence-based aspects of the life in the city (i.e. water quality and quality of life). The integrating nature of the urban exposome approach focused, in this instance, on the complexities of describing water quality indicators at the level of quarter, accounting for urban, general population characteristics, including the opinions/perceptions of residents and municipality stakeholders. The analysis included a suite of water quality aspects (chemical and microbial) and stakeholders’ opinions about environmental issues. Moreover, quality of life was assessed through citizens’ answers about access to healthcare and green spaces, and it was included along with lifestyle/behavior, and demographics in an EWAS analysis.</p><p hwp:id="p-56">In this study, we used an interdisciplinary approach to identify trends in perceptions about environmental exposures and how they correlated with the actual water quality trends of the municipality of Limassol during the hot season (summer) with a combination of chemical and microbial indicators. Additionally, we generated global linkages and correlations between the health status of urban participants and their environmental/lifestyle/behavioral exposures at individual and quarter resolution levels. A total of 129 parameters from 36 variables either directly measured in water (water quality) or derived from the survey (quality of life in the city) were integrated using an exploratory, agnostic, EWAS approach. The general health and chronic health status of the urban participants was not significantly associated in regression analysis with any urban life variable (i.e. neighborhood life, green space use, access to health care). Circular correlation plots were derived from 36 urban exposome variables which were divided in six groups and accounting for self-reported health indicators (general health and having any diseases the past year). The correlation analysis revealed the association of water THM with cleaning activities, corroborating the overall results of simple correlations conducted within this study and our earlier results (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-57">Our study did not reveal any unexpected results in terms of statistically significant associations between the variables included in this work. However, the combination of both the qualitative and quantitative parts allowed us to surface important community concerns about their urban life. Air pollution was ranked as the most significant concern among the study respondents. Besides the general interest of air pollution and its health effects, Cyprus experiences frequently dust storms (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>). These events have probably triggered a specific concern among the population making air pollution the most frequently reported environmental concern in our study.</p><p hwp:id="p-58">Besides a series of limitations such as the cross-sectional design, we were able to demonstrate the use of different tools in an integrative approach which aims to capture the urban exposome of Limassol in this case, but overall can be transferred to the study of the urban exposome of any city. The same approach, for example, if applied to larger cities will allow us to scale up the application of such integrative protocols and will allow for the wider transfer of the results. Future studies should, also, incorporate a more comprehensive assessment of urban quality of life (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>). In this analysis, the indicators of quality of life were limited to life in the neighborhood or the use of green space. Additional information about social life is available from this study population and it will be incorporated in future studies. Characterising the urban exposome profile of Limassol will include from the routinely collected data of the registries and human biomonitoring analyses. Moreover, given the “stakeholders” assessment of the environmental problems, we have moved on with air quality measurements throughout the municipality which were conducted in spring 2018. This application shows how the goal of developing the urban exposome framework can be achieved by using all the available information in a real-time assessment of urban health and provide a tool for decision-making to stakeholders.</p><p hwp:id="p-59">Urbanization, migration and other drivers of urban health are shaping the population health and quality of life in urban settings. Large scale neighborhood renewal programs are the so far initiatives to improve living conditions and quality of life in cities (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref>). The urban exposome as a study framework where cities and their smaller areas are the measurable units can be useful in monitoring urban health in a holistic manner. In other studies, the urban exposome defined as the totality of environmental exposures occurring in cities (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>,<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref>). So far, the use of human exposome in city-based cohorts has been focused on specific exposure-effect association testing in one or multiple cohorts being pooled together (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>). However, the “urban exposome” vs. “specific health outcome/window of exposure” approach does not differ from the traditional environmental health and epidemiological study approaches and it carries the same limitations with regards to generalizability and high levels of variability among the studied populations or settings. In one of the first studies of this kind, where the urban exposome was studied with regards to its associations with pregnancy outcomes it was shown that extrapolating from multiple cities and from multiple populations comes with certain limitations which mostly pertain to the high between city variability (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>). Thus, we need to move on and develop specific urban exposome studies where city-specific characteristics and within-city interactions and networks that are evidence-based, helping authorities to reach informed decisions about everyday life in the city, about city infrastructure changes and its effects on urban health and how it affects personal exposures. This will help the interpretation of between-city difference and will allow the timely evaluation of within-city challenges.</p><p hwp:id="p-60">Our analysis did not raise any particular concerns about the quality of tap drinking water at the urban quarter scale of Limassol city using both chemical and microbial indicators. It was shown however, that residents do not trust, in general, the tap water and opt for using bottled water or water from other sources such as the “vending machine” water (groundwater from mountainous wells) which is very common practice in Cyprus. The cost of tap water is lower compared to bottled or “vending machine” water and, thus, it may pose additional burden to household budgets, as it has been shown in other studies (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref>). Mapping the cost of water by quarter would probably be informative about the existence or not of differences within Limassol in the economic burden of water consumption.</p><p hwp:id="p-61">With the present study we also mapped indicators of quality of life in the city including perceptions about access to green spaces, the life in the neighborhood and reasons for delay or financial constraint in access to health care. No clear disparities at the quarter level were observed for all neighborhood-based queries for the aforementioned indicators, but financial constraints for dental care were noted. Urban green space was particularly noted for being close to participants’ households, however, limited use of such green spaces (e.g. parks) was reported. Both aspects of access to health care and the use of green spaces within Limassol, were studied for the first time. Our approach could form the basis for future targeted and more integrative urban studies on these topics.</p><p hwp:id="p-62">In general, our first results on the application of the urban exposome are promising and in need for verification and expansion. First and foremost, given the different habits of the citizens, exposome studies need to be more inclusive in the assessment of different water sources. Besides the inclusion of standard water testing parameters, future studies should address participant perceptions which are linked to behaviors, and, thus, exposures.</p><p hwp:id="p-63">The case of the water presents one of the most challenging topics of urban setting to be studied within urban exposome studies due to the complex systems that drive water quality and water choices. These challenges are evident also in the literature about water quality indicators and their linkages with the exposome is overall scarce. For example, using an environment-wide association study methodology, the pregnancy exposome study on the INMA-Sabadell Birth Cohort in Spain looked into water disinfection byproducts (trihalomethanes) modeled previously at the individual level among a wider set of other exposures ranging from urinary markers of chemical exposures to air pollution and noise (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>); they found that the three trihalomethane “classes” studied (total trihalomethanes, brominated trihalomethanes and chloroform) were strongly correlated with each other, but not with the other exposures (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>). <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">Albouy-Llaty et al (2016)</xref>, explored the association between endocrine disruptors (atrazine metabolites and nitrate/atrazine mixture) in drinking water and preterm birth accounting for socioeconomic factors (deprivation index) in the Poitou-Charentes region of France (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>). The exposure to atrazine and the nitrate/atrazine mixture at the individual level was inferred from routine community monitoring of water quality; preterm birth was found to be associated with the deprivation index at the level of the neighborhood but not with the exposure to atrazine metabolites. Exposure to atrazine (measured through the metabolite 2-hydroxyatrazine) was not found to be a significant risk factor for preterm birth when accounting for the socioeconomic status of the area (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-64">Developing the health profile of a city in urban exposome terms and integrating different approaches comes with several limitations. Spatio-temporal considerations should be accounted for the dynamic nature of urban exposome profiling. Although enough to estimate the background levels of population exposures to chemicals, the relatively small sample size might have not allowed us to capture spatial differences of the indicators measured within the smaller city administrative units. Additionally, the lack of biomonitoring data on water-related exposures (i.e. to disinfection byproducts in urine) have hindered the full deployment of EWAS tool capabilities. However, the availability of urine biospecimen for this survey will allow us to use biomonitoring and untargeted metabolomics tools in a follow-up manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-21"><label>5.</label><title hwp:id="title-29">Conclusions</title><p hwp:id="p-65">Developing city health profiles with the aid of the urban exposome framework is a novel approach, yet, far from being simple. It demands a comprehensive characterization of relevant indicators ranging from drinking water quality to health perceptions and opinions, etc. The urban exposome framework and its application will generate tools and datasets that will pave the way for developing the next innovative solutions and public health interventions for the city. This case study of the urban exposome in Limassol, Cyprus, demonstrates the feasibility of using novel exposome approaches in studying the city and smaller within-city areas (quarters) as the units of reference. Within this context, the absolute water quality indicators, city residents’ and other stakeholders’ opinions need to be integrated and expanded along with exposomic profiles, such as metabolomics and other-omics platforms and human biomonitoring protocols.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s6" hwp:id="sec-22"><title hwp:id="title-30">Author Contributions</title><p hwp:id="p-66">Original idea: X.D.A. and K.C.M.
