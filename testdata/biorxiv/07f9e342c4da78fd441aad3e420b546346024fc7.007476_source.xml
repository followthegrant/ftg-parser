The large amount of data generated provides an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively interpret potentially complex metagenomic mixtures. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. This interpretation problem can be formulated statistically as a mixture model, where the species of origin of each read is missing, but the complete knowledge of all species present in the mixture helps with the individual reads assignment. Several analytical tools have been proposed to approximately solve this computational problem. Here, we show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. The added accuracy comes at a cost of increased computation time. Our approach is useful for solving complex mixtures involving several related species. We designed our method specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets and with a particular focus on viral pathogen detection, but the principles are applicable more generally to all types of metagenomics mixtures. The code is available on github (<ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="http://github.com/smorfopoulou/metaMix" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/smorfopoulou/metaMix" hwp:id="ext-link-2">http://github.com/smorfopoulou/metaMix</ext-link>) and the process is currently being implemented in a user friendly R package (metaMix, to be submitted to CRAN).</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

In practice, its scope is broad and includes the analysis of a diverse set of samples such as gut microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>), environmental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>) or clinical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>) samples. Among these applications, the discovery of viral pathogens is clearly relevant for clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>). The traditional process of characterizing a virus through potentially difficult and time consuming culture techniques is being revolutionized by advances in high throughput sequencing. Potential benefits of sequence driven methodologies include a more rapid turnaround time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>), combined with a largely unbiased approach in species detection, including the opportunity for unexpected discoveries.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">The analysis of shotgun sequencing data from metagenomic mixtures raises complex computational challenges. Part of the difficulty stems from the read length limitation of existing deep DNA sequencing technologies, an issue compounded by the extensive level of homology across viral and bacterial species. Another complication is the divergence of the microbial DNA sequences from the publicly available references. As a consequence, the assignment of a sequencing read to a database organism is often unclear. Lastly, the number of reads originating from a disease causing pathogen can be low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>). The pathogen contribution to the mixture depends on the biological context, the timing of sample extraction and the type of pathogen considered. Therefore, highly sensitive computational approaches are required.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">A first analytical problem is read classification, that is the assignment of a given sequencing read to a species. Several tools have been developed and these belong to two broadly defined classes: composition-based and similarity-based approaches. The read classification based on sequence composition relies on the intrinsic features of the reads, such as CG content or oligonucleotide distributions. Methods include PhyloPythia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>), Phymm and PhymmBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>), MetaCluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>). These tend to focus on major classes in a dataset and may not perform well on low-abundance populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>). Additionally, results are usually reliable for longer reads only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-6">Similarity based methods, using homology search algorithms such as BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>), are considered the most effective methods for read classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>), at least when other species from the same genus are known. One of the most popular tools using the output of a similarity search algorithm is MEGAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>). MEGAN addresses ambiguous matches by assigning reads that have multiple possible assignments to several species to the taxonomic group containing all these species, or else their lowest common ancestor (LCA). This approach is accurate on a higher taxonomic level. However, it is lacking a formal solution to resolving ambiguous matches. A weakness of the similarity based methods is the appearance of a long tail of species, supported only by a few reads. This results from the classification being decided one read at a time, in contrast to considering all reads simultaneously. A different approach specifically focusing on the relative abundance estimation task using a non-negative LASSO approach is implemented in GASiC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>). This method corrects the observed alignment-based abundances using the reference genomes similarities.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">Methods focused on the statistical inference of the set of present species as well as the estimation of their relative proportions, incorporate knowledge from all reads to assign each individual read to a species. From a statistical standpoint, this identification and quantification question can be thought of as an application of mixture models. These ideas have been applied in the metagenomics context in frequentist (GRAMMy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>)) and Bayesian (Pathoscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>)) settings. GRAMMy formulates the problem as a finite mixture model, using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the relative genome abundances. Pathoscope refines this process by penalizing reads with ambiguous matches in the presence of reads with unique matches and enforcing parsimony within a Bayesian context. Both methods work with unassembled sequence data and they are not currently setup to incorporate an initial short read assembly step, which could be achieved by assigning a higher weight to contigs formed by multiple reads.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">A mixture model is concerned with the species relative abundance estimation, as well as the read to species assignment. A related but distinct question concerns the set of species which should be included in the mixture model. This question is closely related to the biological question of asking what species are present in the mixture. Including all species flagged as potential match by the read classification can introduce a large number of species (often <italic toggle="yes">&gt;</italic> 1,000). Mixture models will, in this situation, identify a large number of species at low levels. This interpretation is appropriate in some applications. In many other cases, the expectation is that the underlying species set should be parsimonious and that some divergence with database species or sequencing errors can explain a large fraction of the non matching reads.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Hence, a better statistical formulation of the community profiling problem is the exploration of the candidate organisms state-space. In this context, non nested models can be compared based on their marginal likelihood. Within this Bayesian framework, readily interpretable probabilities, such as the posterior probabilities of species sets can be used to quantify the support for a species in the mixture. Finally, more complex hypotheses regarding for example the number of viral species or the joint presence of two distinct organisms can be investigated.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">The main challenge behind such a formulation is computational. For a large number of potential species, there is a combinatoric explosion of the potential subsets to be considered. Efficient computational strategies are required to make this problem tractable. Here we show that this inference can be achieved for modern scale metagenomics datasets. Our strategy is based on parallel tempering, a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique, which enables the use of parallel computing to speed up the inference. Our tool are being implemented in a user friendly R package (metaMix) that produces posterior probabilities for various models and the relative abundances under each model. We demonstrate its value using several clinical and artificial datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">Bioinformatics pre-processing</title><p hwp:id="p-11">Prior to running the mixture model for metagenomic profiling, several steps are required to process the short read sequence data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

For metagenomic analysis of human samples, reads originating from the human host are not relevant for our research question. We therefore remove human host reads, using a two-step approach to limit computation time: initially a short read aligner (novoalign, <ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="http://www.novocraft.com" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.novocraft.com" hwp:id="ext-link-4">www.novocraft.com</ext-link>), followed by BLASTn. The next step is only applicable when the focus is on virus discovery using transcriptome reads. We remove ribosomal RNA sequences, using BLASTn against the Silva rRNA database (<ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="http://www.arb-silva.de/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arb-silva.de/" hwp:id="ext-link-5">http://www.arb-silva.de/</ext-link>).</p><p hwp:id="p-14">The remaining reads are assembled into contigs using the Velvet short read assembler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>). For each contig we record the number of reads required for its assembly, using this information at the stage of species abundance estimation. A Velvet tuning parameter is the user defined <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mer length that specifies the extent of overlap required to assemble read pairs. Metagenomic assembly is not a straightforward task, as short k-mers work best with the low abundance organisms, while long k-mers with the highly abundance ones. The shorter the k-mer the greater the chance of spurious overlaps, hence we choose relatively high <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>-mer length, in order to avoid chimeric contigs.</p><p hwp:id="p-15">For each contig and un-assembled read we record the potentially originating species, using the nucleotide to protein homology matching tool BLASTx. We use BLASTx due to the higher level of conservation expected at the protein level compared to nucleotides. This choice is guided by our focus in viral pathogens and viruses have high genetic diversity and divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-16">This step generates a sparse similarity matrix between the read sequences and the protein sequences (species as columns, reads and contigs as rows), which is stored using the R package Matrix to handle sparse matrices.</p><p hwp:id="p-17">The statistical method described in the remainder of this section considers the competing models that could accommodate our observed data, that is the BLASTx results and compares them. The different models represent different sets of species being present in the sample. The method works on two levels of inference: in the first instance we assume a set of species to be present in the sample and we estimate this model’s parameters given the data. The other level of inference is the model comparison so as to assess the more plausible model. The process is iterated in order to explore the model state space.</p></sec><sec id="s2b" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-5">Model specification assuming a fixed set of species</title><p hwp:id="p-18">Assuming a given set of <italic toggle="yes">K</italic> species from which the reads can originate, the metagenomic problem can be summarized as a mixture problem, for which the assignment of the sequencing reads to species is unknown and must be determined.

A practical prior for the mixing parameters <bold><italic toggle="yes">w</italic></bold> is the Dirichlet distribution owing to its conjugate status to the multinomial distribution.

Following initial processing using our bionformatics pipeline, we were left with 1,261,575 non host reads and contigs for subsequent analyses. There were 3,150 potential species based on the BLASTx output.</p><p hwp:id="p-73"><italic toggle="yes">metaMix</italic> The all-species mixture model identified 80 species having one or more reads assigned to them. We then explored this reduced state-space. The metaMix resulting species profile consisted of 7 species (Supplementary Table S2). Two different coronaviruses strains were identified: Human coronavirus OC43 and Bovine coronavirus, with almost half a million reads assigned to each. The high read count assigned to both coronaviruses, as well as the similar read classification probabilities (Supplementary figure S1) suggest a single but novel strain which is not included in our reference database.</p><p hwp:id="p-74">We followed up on the sequences assigned to the “unknown category”, i.e approximately 155K reads, by looking for nucleotide similarity with NR-NT using BLASTn. Approximately half of the reads originated from an untranslated region of the Coronavirus genome, which is not captured by the protein reference database. The remaining reads matched confidently to either <italic toggle="yes">Danio rerio</italic> (zebrafish) sequences or <italic toggle="yes">Gallus gallus</italic> (chicken), two organisms whose proteins are not in the human microbiome reference we are using. The zebrafish and chicken matches were explained as barcode leakage resulting from multiplexing on the same flowcell zebrafish and chicken RNA-Seq libraries. metaMix appropriately assigned these reads to the ”unknown” category, producing a clean probabilistic summary (Supplementary Table S2).

Our assessment is that Pathoscope is confused by the lack of completeness of databases combined with the absence of an ”unknown” category, which prevents it from dealing with these unassigned reads sensibly. Pathoscope completed its analysis in 10 minutes.</p><p hwp:id="p-77"><italic toggle="yes">MEGAN</italic> MEGAN assigned the reads to 30 taxa.

The method is implemented in a R package (package in preparation and to be released on CRAN, scripts currently available at <ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="http://github.com/smorfopoulou/metaMix" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/smorfopoulou/metaMix" hwp:id="ext-link-7">http://github.com/smorfopoulou/metaMix</ext-link>). Using a Bayesian mixture model framework, we account for model uncertainty by performing model averaging and we resolve ambiguous assignments by considering all reads simultaneously. A key feature of the method is that it provides probabilities that answer pertinent biological questions, in particular the posterior probability for the presence of a species in the mixture. Additionally it accurately quantifies the relative proportions of the organisms.</p><p hwp:id="p-79">This general framework is designed to address interpretation issues associated with closely related strains in the sample, low abundance organisms and absence of genomes from the reference database. We show that metaMix outperforms other methods in the community profiling task, particularly when complex structures with closely related strains are studied. It also outperforms the other methods at the task of relative abundance estimation. The method can deal with either unassembled reads or assembled contigs or both, allowing for flexibility of choice for the bioinformatics pre-processing. In practice, the choice of bioinformatics processing prior to the application of our Bayesian mixture analysis must be optimized for each application, and our processing pipeline has been designed with viral sequence identification from transcriptome sequencing as a main goal. Nevertheless, as demonstrated by our analysis of the artificial bacterial community dataset, the method can be applied in other contexts.</p><p hwp:id="p-80">The sensitivity and general applicability of metaMix comes at an increased computational cost, requiring access to a multi-core computer to run efficiently. For the datasets presented here, the computation time remained manageable and did not exceed a few hours, using 12 cores to run 12 parallel chains. Nevertheless, a limitation of metaMix is the increased processing time for very large datasets. Speed related improvements can be implemented in scenarios where the species ambiguity concerns only a small proportion of the read set. Reads with certain assignments can be flagged prior to the MCMC exploration of the state-space. Then only their assignment information can be carried forward, thereby reducing the size of the relevant R object.</p><p hwp:id="p-81">metaMix effectively complements faster but more approximate methods designed to perform similar tasks. It is most useful for complex datasets for which the interpretation is challenging.</p></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="supplementary-material" hwp:id="sec-14"><title hwp:id="title-15">SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p hwp:id="p-82">Supplementary Text, Supplementary tables S1, S2, S3, Supplementary figure S1.</p></sec><sec id="s6" hwp:id="sec-15"><title hwp:id="title-16">FUNDING</title><p hwp:id="p-83">Annals of Human Genetics studentship.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-17">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p hwp:id="p-84">We thank David Balding for the constructive comments on the manuscript, Christian Robert for the helpful methodological discussion, Judith Breuer, Julianne Lockwood and Mike Hubank for data sharing and informative discussions on the biology of the results.</p><p hwp:id="p-85"><italic toggle="yes">Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
