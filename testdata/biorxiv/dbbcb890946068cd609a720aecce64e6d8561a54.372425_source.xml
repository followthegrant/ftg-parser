However, factors facilitating locomotor learning are poorly understood. We hypothesized that augmenting the braking forces, rather than propulsion forces, experienced at the feet would increase locomotor adaptation and learning. To test this, forces were modulated during split-belt walking with distinct slopes: inclined (larger propulsion than braking), declined (larger braking than propulsion), and flat (similar propulsion and braking). These groups were compared using step length asymmetry, which is a clinically relevant measure robustly adapted on split-belt treadmills. Unexpectedly, the group with larger propulsion demands (i.e., the incline group) adapted faster and more, and had larger after-effects when the split-belt perturbation was removed. We also found that subjects who propelled more during baseline and experienced larger disruptions of propulsion forces in early adaptation exhibited greater after-effects, which further highlights the catalytic role of propulsion on locomotor learning. The relevance of mechanical demands on shaping our movements was also indicated by the steady state split-belt behavior, during which each group recovered their baseline leg orientation to meet leg-specific force demands at the expense of step length symmetry. Notably, the flat group was nearly symmetric, whereas the incline and decline group overshot and undershot symmetry, respectively. Taken together, our results indicate that forces propelling the body facilitate gait adaptation during split-belt walking. Therefore, interventions that increase propulsion demands may be a viable strategy for augmenting locomotor learning in individuals with hemiparesis.</p><sec hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Key Points Summary</title><list list-type="bullet" hwp:id="list-1"><list-item hwp:id="list-item-1"><p hwp:id="p-3">Split-belt walking (i.e., legs moving at different speeds) can induce locomotor learning and even improve hemiparetic gait, but little is known about how to facilitate this process.</p></list-item><list-item hwp:id="list-item-2"><p hwp:id="p-4">We investigated the effect of braking and propulsion forces on locomotor learning by testing young unimpaired subjects on the split-belt condition at different slopes (i.e., flat, decline, and incline), which distinctively modified these forces.</p></list-item><list-item hwp:id="list-item-3"><p hwp:id="p-5">Propulsion forces facilitated locomotor learning indicated by 1) greater adaptation and after-effects following split-belt walking of the inclined group, which experienced larger propulsion demands and 2) a positive correlation between individual after-effects and subject-specific propulsion during regular walking and initial steps in the split condition.</p></list-item><list-item hwp:id="list-item-4"><p hwp:id="p-6">Interestingly, incline and decline groups self-selected asymmetric step lengths at steady state in the split condition, challenging the prominent view that step length asymmetry is a biomarker for inefficient gait.</p></list-item><list-item hwp:id="list-item-5"><p hwp:id="p-7">Our results suggest that interventions augmenting propulsion demands could correct hemiparetic gait more effectively.</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-3">Keywords</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">human</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">split-belt</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">motor adaptation</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">kinetics</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">walking</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-6">gait</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-7">kinematics</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="47"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-4">Introduction</title><p hwp:id="p-8">There is an interest in increasing the extent of locomotor adaptation and learning induced by split-belt walking because it can correct the step length asymmetry of individuals with hemiparesis, such as stroke survivors.

However, split-belt walking is not always effective even after repeated exposure to the split-belt experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59" hwp:id="xref-ref-59-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-59">Reisman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">Lewek <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) and it is still unclear why some stroke survivors re-learn to walk symmetrically but others do not. Thus, it is fundamental to identify factors facilitating split-belt adaptation to augment them for increasing motor learning in all individuals.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">The increased mechanical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65" hwp:id="xref-ref-65-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-65">Selgrade <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), step length asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58" hwp:id="xref-ref-58-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-58">Reisman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and hence metabolic effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Finley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), upon introducing the split-belt environment are thought to drive locomotor adaptation. Notably, these three factors are large during the initial steps of split-belt walking and are minimized as subjects learn to walk in the split-belt context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Finley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65" hwp:id="xref-ref-65-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-65">Selgrade <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Thus, modulating anterior-posterior forces applied at the feet during split-belt walking could facilitate locomotor adaptation given their direct impact on mechanical work and step lengths in regular gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Donelan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In particular, we hypothesize that altering braking forces could modulate the adaptation of gait based on prior studies showing that braking forces are critical for gait stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Beschorner <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) as subjects are most likely to fall during the braking phase of gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57" hwp:id="xref-ref-57-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-57">Redfern <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and that braking forces are tightly regulated during split-belt walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52" hwp:id="xref-ref-52-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-52">Ogawa <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Notably, braking forces are suddenly disrupted when the split-belt perturbation is introduced and this perturbation is reduced as subjects adapt their gait. Thus, we proposed that braking forces could facilitate subject-specific gait adaptation and therefore, increasing these forces would augment the extent of locomotor learning.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">To test this hypothesis, we assessed subjects’ gait before, during, and after split-belt walking at different inclinations, which naturally and distinctively modulated the braking and propulsion forces experienced at the feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">Lay <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">2007</xref>). We found that inclination increased locomotor adaptation and learning as hypothesized, but not through the proposed mechanism. While the braking and propulsion forces were adapted and stored, it was the propulsion forces that were responsible for augmenting locomotor adaptation and learning, as quantified by the larger changes in step length asymmetry during and after split-belt walking. Specifically, declined walking that accentuated braking did not lead to as much adaptation as inclined walking, which augmented propulsion. In addition, propulsion forces during baseline and early adaptation were highly predictive of the extent of locomotor learning at an individual level. Interestingly, each inclination group recovered their baseline leg orientation to meet force demands at the expense of step length symmetry, which was surprising given the consistent human tendency to self-select symmetric step lengths in the split-belt environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">Bruijn <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82" hwp:id="xref-ref-82-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-82">Yokoyama <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).

All groups experienced the same number of strides per epoch (baseline: between 50 and 150, adaptation: 600, post-adaptation: 600). Dashed lines indicate when the resting breaks occurred (B) The decomposition of step length into leading (α) and trailing (X) leg positions with respect to the body are illustrated. This decomposition was done because it is known that inclination affects these aspects of step length differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">Leroux, et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Dewolf et al 2017</xref>). Also note that when taking a step, the step length will depend on the position of the leading and trailing leg, which are generating a braking and propulsion force, respectively. (C) Anterior-posterior forces are plotted for sample subjects walking at the baseline epoch in each inclination condition. The filtered forces (un-shifted panels) clearly illustrate the effect of inclination on braking and propulsion forces: the incline group reduced braking and accentuated propulsion, the flat group experienced similar braking and propulsion, and the decline group accentuated braking and reduced propulsion. To facilitate the identification of peak braking (maximum negative value) and peak propulsion forces (maximum positive value) in all conditions, we removed the slope-specific projection of subjects’ weight on the AP direction (shifted panels). This procedure also allowed us to characterize the magnitude of kinetic outcome measures for each condition beyond those due to the slope-specific bias. (D) We used the peak braking and peak propulsion force for each step to compute outcome measures of interest, such as the ∆Adapt measure. This measure was computed to quantify increments or reductions in magnitude within the adaptation epoch of each specific parameter. Note that increases in magnitude were defined as positive changes, whereas decreases in magnitude were defined as negative changes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="372425_fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-1"/></fig><sec id="s2b1" hwp:id="sec-6"><title hwp:id="title-9">Baseline</title><p hwp:id="p-14">Subjects first experienced a baseline epoch to characterize their gait at the specific inclination at which they were going to walk throughout the study.

The hip position, which is a proxy for the body’s position, was estimated as the mean instantaneous position across hip markers. α-distances were positive because the foot usually lands in front of the hips, whereas X-distances were negative because the trailing leg is behind the hips at foot landing.

The anterior-posterior ground reaction forces (AP forces) where normalized by each subject’s body weight to account for inter-subject differences in weight. The quiet stance forces for the incline and decline groups were subtracted in order to facilitate the identification of both positive (propulsion) and negative (braking) features of the AP forces at all slopes and to characterize the magnitude of these force for each condition beyond those due to the slope-specific bias. The removal of the quiet stance forces is illustrated for a representative subject at each inclination in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-4" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1C</xref>. Note that at quiet stance (i.e., when subjects are just standing), there is an anterior-posterior ground reaction force due to the projection of subjects’ weight on the surface of the treadmill. This quiet stance force is zero for the flat group since AP forces are negligible during quiet stance on a level surface. However, this quiet stance force was substantial for the inclined and declined group. Thus, we calculated the quiet stance force based on the inclination of the treadmill and subtracted it from AP forces during gait (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-1-1" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-1">Eq. 1</xref>).<disp-formula id="eqn1" hwp:id="disp-formula-1" hwp:rev-id="xref-disp-formula-1-1">

Medium baseline behavior was used as a reference in all outcome measures computed with kinematic parameters (e.g., step length asymmetry and step lengths), whereas speed-specific baselines were used for kinetic parameters (e.g., braking and propulsion forces). In other words, fast baseline was used as a reference for the leg walking fast during adaptation and the slow baseline was used as a reference for the leg walking slow during adaptation, whereas medium baseline was used as a reference for both legs when they walked at the same medium speed in post-adaptation. This methodology is consistent with prior split-belt studies indicating that kinetic parameters plateau near values similar to those of the speed-specific baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52" hwp:id="xref-ref-52-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-52">Ogawa <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Outcome measures of interest were Early Adaptation, Late Adaptation, After-Effects, ∆Adapt, and ΔPost. <bold>Early Adaptation</bold> (EarlyA) was defined as the difference between the averaged behavior of the first 5 strides of the split-belt condition (strides 1-5) and the speed-specific baseline values as indicated earlier. This outcome measure characterized the extent to which subjects were perturbed by the split-belt condition. Note that we did not exclude any strides of adaptation because all subjects experienced a short split condition before the adaptation period to minimize startle effects. <bold>Late Adaptation</bold> (LateA) was defined as the average of the last 40 strides of adaptation for all parameters. This outcome measure indicated the steady state behavior reached at the end of the adaptation period. <bold>After-Effects</bold> were defined as the average of the first 5 strides of Post-Adaptation relative to medium baseline such that increments and reductions in magnitude of a specific parameter with respect to medium baseline were marked as positive or negative, respectively. We also characterized the behavioral changes within the adaptation and post-adaptation with indices ∆Adapt and ∆Post, respectively. ∆<bold>Adapt</bold> and ∆<bold>Post</bold> were computed as the difference between Late and Early Adaptation for ∆Adapt and late and early post-adaptation for ∆Post (i.e., average of the last 40 strides or 5 strides for late and early, respectively). This was done such that an increase in the magnitude of a parameter during either adaptation or post-adaptation resulted in positive values and a reduction of the parameter was marked as negative values. For example, we illustrate ΔAdapt for braking and propulsion forces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-7" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1D</xref>. Note that the braking force decreased during the adaptation period (negative value), whereas the propulsion force increased during the same period (positive value). Lastly, the effect of slope on the rate of adaptation was determined by fitting the averaged step length asymmetry for each inclination group with a single exponential (y=a*exp((−1/τ)*x)+c) using a non-linear least squares method. The 95% confidence intervals of the Tau coefficient were used to compare the adaptation rates across groups.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float" hwp:id="T1" hwp:rev-id="xref-table-wrap-1-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;372425v1/TBL1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">T1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">tbl1</object-id><label>Table 1:</label><caption hwp:id="caption-2"><p hwp:id="p-25">Outcome Measures</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="372425_tbl1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-3"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2f" hwp:id="sec-16"><title hwp:id="title-19">Post-Hoc Data Analysis</title><p hwp:id="p-26">Following our planned analysis, it was clear that propulsion forces were more important for locomotor adaptation and learning processes than anticipated. Thus, features characterizing each subject’s propulsion forces were used as predictors in a statistical model to determine after-effects of step length asymmetry at an individual level. In this propulsion-based model, we hypothesized that perturbation of the propulsion forces per leg (i.e., propulsion during early adaptation) would be predictive of step length asymmetry after-effects. We also considered that each individual’s magnitude of baseline propulsion could influence after-effects because we reasoned that those with larger propelling tendencies maybe more prone to correcting reductions to their propulsion forces. Additionally, we included subject-specific propulsion asymmetries during baseline in our model because we thought that those who are naturally more asymmetric could be less resistant to update their movements for achieving the large propulsion asymmetry required for split-belt walking. In sum, a multiple regression analysis was performed with step length asymmetry after-effects as a dependent variable and 6 regressors: the propulsion force perturbation of each leg, the baseline capacity to propel of each leg, the asymmetry of the baseline propulsion forces and a categorical factor indicating the inclination condition. Every subject’s Baseline Propulsion Magnitude for each leg was computed during medium baseline, which is the average belt speed during adaptation and post-adaptation epochs. On the other hand, each subject’s Baseline Propulsion Asymmetry was computed as the difference in average behavior between the dominant and non-dominant legs during the most challenging baseline condition (fast baseline), which increased this measure of kinetic asymmetry facilitating its assessment. We specifically computed the mean difference between the dominant minus the non-dominant propulsion during fast baseline. Therefore, zero indicated that both legs generate equal propulsion forces, positive numbers indicated that the dominant leg propelled more than the non-dominant leg and vice versa for negative numbers. We also perform two additional analyses to evaluate the predictive power of the propulsion-based model on after-effects of step length asymmetry at an individual level. First, we applied the same procedure described above using step length, rather than propulsion force, to determine if any information about the behavior of individual legs was predictive of the inter-subject variability of after-effects in step length asymmetry. Second we used a mean-based model that only included the categorical factor as a regressor to test if the propulsion-based model accounted for more inter-subject variability on step length asymmetry after-effects than the group mean behavior. The explanatory power between models was contrasted with Bayes Factor Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">Kass <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>) using the Bayesian Information Criteria approximation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74" hwp:id="xref-ref-74-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-74">Wagenmakers, 2007</xref>). Lastly, several multiple linear regressions between kinetic and kinematic variables were performed within and across epochs to investigate the association between propulsion forces and after-effects in step length asymmetry. Of note, the regression of propulsion forces across epochs (i.e., between ∆Adapt and after-effects) was done with contralateral legs to be consistent with the post-hoc observation that adaptation of step length on one side led to after-effects on the other side (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-1" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2g" hwp:id="sec-17"><title hwp:id="title-20">Statistical Analysis</title><p hwp:id="p-27">One-way ANOVAs were used to test the effects of inclination condition on kinetic and kinematic outcome measures (e.g., ∆Adapt, After-Effects, etc.). Outcome measures with significant ANOVAs were further analyzed with Tukey post-hoc testing. We compared the time constants estimated from single exponential fits of group averages of step length asymmetry using the 95% confidence intervals for each rate coefficient. Time constants were determined to be significantly different when the confidence intervals were not overlapping. We additionally wished to know if each group’s step length asymmetry steady state was different from zero, therefore we performed a two-sided t-tests on each group’s late adaptation values. A three-way ANOVA was also performed to determine the effect of leg and inclination condition on the changes of step length that occurred during adaptation and post-adaptation. As such, the dependent variables were changes of step length that occurred during these epochs (i.e., ∆Adapt and ∆Post); the independent variables were slope (i.e., incline, flat, decline), leg (i.e., fast or slow leg), epoch (i.e., adaptation or post-adaptation), and the interactions between these independent variables. Lastly, two multiple regressions were performed for step length asymmetry to assess the association between 1) the perturbation (EarlyA) vs. adaptation (∆Adapt) of this parameter and 2) its adaptation vs. its after-effects. In these regressions group was used as a categorical factor only if it was found to be independent of the continuous variable (i.e., EarlyA for regression 1 and ∆Adapt for regression 2) as indicated by a non-significant Pearson Coefficient. Should a strong correlation between the categorical and continuous regressor was found, a linear regression was performed and the confounding influence of group was noted. For visualization purposes only, we displayed the results of a linear regression when the continuous variable of the multiple regression analysis was a significant factor. A significance level of α=0.05 was used for all statistical tests.

However, each group reached a different step length asymmetry by Late Adaptation (p&lt;0.001) such that the flat group plateaued near symmetric step lengths (SLA_LateA=0, p=0.08), whereas the decline group undershot step length symmetry (SLA_LateA&lt;0, p&lt;0.001) and the incline group overshot step length symmetry (SLA_LateA &gt;0, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-2" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, while both sloped groups were perturbed more than the flat group (SLA_EarlyA: group main effect p=0.003; incline vs. flat p=0.036; decline vs. flat p=0.002), only the incline group adapted more than the other two groups (SLA_∆Adapt: group main effects p&lt;0.001; incline vs. flat p&lt;0.001; incline vs. decline p=0.002) and faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-3" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; inlayed plot). Importantly, groups were not only distinct in their adaptation, but also in their after-effects (p=0.002) such that the incline group had greater after-effect than the decline (p=0.03) and flat groups (p=0.002). Our regression analyses on individual subjects revealed that larger perturbations led to more adaptation (pmdl&lt;0.001, R<sup>2</sup>=89, SLA_EarlyA: p&lt;0.001) and greater adaptation resulted in more after-effects (R<sup>2</sup>=46; p&lt;0.001). However, these associations were likely driven by group differences since group was either a significant categorical predictor of adaptation (Group: p&lt;0.001) or group was strongly correlated to the continuous predictor of after-effects (p=0.004). In other words, the larger perturbation and adaptation of the inclined condition presumably resulted in greater after-effects in this group compared to others. Therefore, contrary to our hypothesis, the slope condition augmenting propulsion (i.e., incline walking) rather than braking led to more and faster adaptation and greater after-effects.

Importantly, these braking and propulsion demands were additionally regulated by walking speed, as shown by the distinct leg orientations between slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-8" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> 1<sup>st</sup> row) and fast baseline walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-9" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> 3<sup>rd</sup> row). These inclination- and speed-mediated demands persisted during split-belt walking. Consistently, subjects oriented their legs in late adaptation at all sloped conditions according to the speed at which each leg walked. In other words, the slow and fast legs’ orientation in late adaptation was similar to the one at slow and fast baseline walking, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-10" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig 4C</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> row: fast and slow leg orientation in the speed-specific baseline is indicated by red and blue dashed lines, respectively). These leg orientations consequently led to step lengths that were only the same at the end of adaptation in the flat group, but not in the two sloped conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-11" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig 4C</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> row: fast and slow step lengths are shown by red and blue solid lines, respectively). Lastly, leg orientation during post-adaptation indicated that the forward (α) positions of the legs were roughly the same before and after removal of the split perturbation, which deferred from α-positions at medium baseline walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-12" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig 4C</xref>. 4<sup>th</sup> row, black dashed lines). Conversely, the trailing positions (X) were swapped between legs: X-position of the slow leg during post-adaptation was similar to the X-position of the fast leg during late adaptation (dotted red lines) and vice versa for the other leg. This switching contributed to the reduced step lengths of the slow leg during post-adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-13" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig 4C</xref>. 4<sup>th</sup> row blue solid lines) also presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-5" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3</xref>. Thus, leg orientation did not immediately return to baseline behavior during early post-adaptation, indicating that leg orientation is not purely reflecting the state of the environment but it is adjusted through an active adaptive process. In sum, asymmetric step lengths in sloped split-belt walking resulted from the adaptation of leg orientation to generate the forces for walking at the specific speed and inclination imposed on each group, which will be further discussed in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="s3d" hwp:id="sec-22"><title hwp:id="title-28">Braking and propulsion forces were predominantly changed in the inclined and declined groups, respectively</title><p hwp:id="p-34">We assessed the adaptation of forces under the distinct inclination conditions before investigating the relation between kinetic and kinematic measures during and after split-belt walking. We found that braking and propulsion forces were predominantly modified during adaptation and post-adaptation in the sloped condition that naturally prioritized them. In other words, braking was mostly modulated in the decline group, whereas propulsion was primarily modulated in the incline one. This preferential regulation of braking and propulsion forces was indicated by the significant group effect on early adaptation for braking forces on both legs Bs_EarlyA: p =0.003; Bf_EarlyA: p&lt;0.001) and propulsion forces of the slow leg (Ps_EarlyA: p =0.038) but not the fast one (Pf_EarlyA: p_anova=0.15). More specifically, the braking and propulsion forces were respectively more perturbed in the decline and incline groups compared to the flat group (Bs_EarlyA: decline vs. flat p=0.015; Bf_EarlyA: decline vs. flat p&lt;0.001; Ps_EarlyA: incline vs. flat p&lt;0.001). Despite the group differences in early adaptation, only the forces contributing to the step lengths of the fast leg (i.e., fast breaking and slow propulsion) were adapted differently across groups (Bf_∆Adapt: p&lt;0.001; Ps_∆Adapt: p &lt;0.001), whereas the other forces were adapted similarly across sloped conditions (Bs_∆Adapt: p=0.10; Pf_∆Adapt: p=0.35). Once again braking was preferentially adapted in the decline group compared to flat walking (p=0.0011) and propulsion was preferentially adapted in the incline group compared to flat walking (p=0.0041). Group analyses on post-adaptation indicated that sloped condition had a significant impact on the after-effects of slow braking (p&lt;0.001), slow propulsion (p=0.036), and fast propulsion (p&lt;0.001) and a trending effect on fast braking (p=0.076). However, only the forces contributing to after-effects of the slow step length (i.e., slow braking and fast propulsion) exhibited greater after-effects than those regularly observed after split-belt walking in a level surface (Bs_∆Post: decline vs. flat p&lt;0.001; Pf_∆Post: incline vs. flat p=0.006 in contrast with Ps_∆Post: incline vs. flat p=0.92). In sum, inclination conditions predominantly modified the perturbation, adaptation, and after-effects of braking and propulsion forces in a preferential manner: inclined walking mostly modified the adaptation of propulsion, whereas decline walking mostly altered the adaptation of braking.</p></sec><sec id="s3e" hwp:id="sec-23"><title hwp:id="title-29">A propulsion-based model predicted subject-specific after-effects in step length asymmetry</title><p hwp:id="p-35">While braking and propulsion forces were both altered with inclination during and after split-belt walking, the adaptation of movements only increased in the incline group who experienced greater propulsion demands. This suggested that propulsion forces, rather than braking ones, played an important role in the adaptation and after-effects of walking movements. Consistently, we found that a propulsion-based model could predict individual after-effects in step length asymmetry (F(4, 20)=17.5, R<sup>2</sup>=0.73, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-1" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). In particular, we observed a significant association between after-effects in step length asymmetry and the perturbation of the slow leg’s propulsion (t=-2.42, p=0.028), the slow leg’s baseline propulsion (t=2.38, p=0.030), and baseline’s propulsion asymmetry (t=2.88, p=0.011). These significant coefficients in the multiple regression equation indicated that subjects exhibiting greater after-effects in step length asymmetry were 1) those who were more perturbed during split-belt walking, 2) those who naturally had higher propulsion tendencies during baseline walking, and 3) those who naturally had larger propulsion asymmetries (i.e., larger propulsion with their dominant than non-dominant leg) during baseline walking. Interestingly, these associations were exclusive to the non-dominant (i.e., slow) leg given that propulsion features of the dominant (i.e., fast) leg during baseline (t=-0.47, p=0.64) or early adaptation (t=1.20, p=0.25) were not significant predictors of after-effects in step length asymmetry. Importantly, inclination (categorical factor) was also not a significant predictor (t&lt;0.28, p&gt;0.78) in the multiple regression analysis, indicating that the propulsion-based model was not simply reflecting the differences in after-effects across groups (reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-4" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The non-significant predictive power of the sloped condition was reiterated by the Bayes Factor of 925 indicating that the propulsion-based model had “very strong” predictive power (Kass Raftery, 2007) compared to a model that only included the mean after-effect values for each group. This larger predictive power of the propulsion-based model was maintained, but to a lesser extent when using more strides to characterize after-effects (1:10 strides, BF=97.3) as in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46" hwp:id="xref-ref-46-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-46">Malone <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Lastly, the propulsion-based model was still a better predictor of subject-specific step length asymmetries than a multiple regression model based on individual step lengths (F(2, 22)=6.04, R<sup>2</sup>=0.21, p=0.02; Bayes Factor of 11.9*10^3), in which only the disturbance of the slow step length was a significant factor (SLs_EarlyA: t=-2.26 p=0.038; SLf_EarlyA: t=-2.05, p=0.057; SLs_base: t=-0.20, p=0.84; SLf_base: t=-0.47, p=0.65; SLasym: t=-0.06, p=0.95). This indicated that subject-specific propulsion forces during baseline and adaptation provided more information about inter-subject variability of after-effects than step lengths of individual legs, which is remarkable given that step lengths were used to directly compute step length asymmetry. Therefore, each participant’s tendencies to regulate propulsion forces during baseline and adaptation epochs were a strong indicator of individual after-effects in step length asymmetry, which represent subject-specific learning during split-belt walking.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F5"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;372425v1/FIG5</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F5</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig5</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption hwp:id="caption-6"><title hwp:id="title-30">Adaptation and after-effects of braking and propulsion forces</title><p hwp:id="p-36">(A) Stride-by-stride time courses of braking and propulsion forces by each leg are shown during slow, fast, and medium baseline, adaptation, and post-adaptation.

(B) Slow leg’s propulsion during early adaptation vs. Ps_∆Adapt. Multiple regression indicated that the adaptation of the slow leg’s propulsion (Ps_∆Adapt) depended on the inclination condition and the slow leg’s propulsion during early adaptation. Specifically, large perturbations of the slow leg’s propulsion during early adaptation led to more adaptation of this leg’s propulsion force. (C) Slow leg’s propulsion adaptation (Ps_∆Adapt) vs. Fast leg’s propulsion post-adaptation after-effects (Pf_after-effects). Multiple regression indicated that the fast leg’s after-effects in propulsion depended on the inclination condition and the slow leg’s adaptation of propulsion forces. This contralateral relation between adaptation and post-adaptation was consistent with the one observed in step lengths of individual legs. (D) Positive correlation between after-effects in fast legs’ propulsion (Pf_after-effects) and fast leg’s X-position (fast X-position). In particular, subjects who generated smaller propulsion forces during post-adaptation were those whose trailing X-position was closer to their body (Large fast X-position values). This association is consistent with previous reports between magnitude of propulsion forces and trailing leg position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">Leroux, et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Dewolf et al 2017</xref>).

More specifically, trailing X-positions close to the body (large X-positions) resulted in reduced step lengths (negative step length values) with respect to baseline walking. (F) Positive correlation between after-effects in step length asymmetry (SLA_after-effect) and step lengths of the leg that walked slow during the split condition (SLs_after-effect). This is consistent with results indicating that step length asymmetries during post-adaptation are mostly attributed to the slow leg’s step length after-effects.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="372425_fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-8"/></fig><p hwp:id="p-38">Finally, we observed that this association between unilateral disturbance of slow leg’s propulsion and after-effects in step length asymmetry can be explained by the impact of propulsion forces on the slow step length during post-adaptation. This was indicated by regression analyses between kinetic and kinematic variables within and across adaptation and post-adaptation epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-2" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6B-F</xref>). These regressions revealed that large perturbations of the slow leg’s propulsion led to large adaptation of this parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-3" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6B</xref>; pmdl&lt;0.001, R<sup>2</sup>=0.82), such that subjects that were perturbed the most were also those that adapted the slow leg’s propulsion the most. In addition, the adaptation of the slow leg’s propulsion force was positively associated with after-effects on the other leg’s propulsion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-4" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6C</xref>; p=0.020, R<sup>2</sup>=0.38). In other words, larger adaptation of the slow leg’s propulsion was related to greater after-effects on the propulsion of the fast side and not on the slow side (data not shown). This is consistent with the post-hoc observation that adaptation of step length on one side led to after-effects on the other side (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-6" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Importantly, there was a strong association between the fast leg’s propulsion after-effects and those of the trailing position of this leg (fast X-position) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-5" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6D</xref>; R<sup>2</sup>=0.80) when taking a step with the leg that walked slow in the split condition. Consistently, the after-effects of the fast leg’s X-position were associated to those of the slow leg’s step length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-6" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6E</xref>; p&lt;0.001, R<sup>2</sup>=0.84), which was strongly associated with step length asymmetry after-effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-7" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6F</xref>; R<sup>2</sup>=0.89). It is worth pointing out that group was a factor in all these regressions since it was either a significant categorical predictor in the multiple regressions (6B: Ps_EarlyA: p&lt;0.001, pgroup&lt;0.001; 6C: Ps_∆Adapt: p=0.68, pgroup=0.057; 6E: Xf_After-Effects: p&lt;0.001, pgroup=0.015) or significantly correlated to the continuous variables (6D: Pearson p=0.043; 6F: Pearson p=0.024). This suggests that these associations might have been clearly observed in our study because of the range of inter-subject variability originated by the different sloped conditions. Taken together, the larger after-effects in step length asymmetry were mediated by unilateral step length after-effects on the side that walked slow, which was facilitated by large disturbance and adaptation of the slow leg’s propulsion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-24"><title hwp:id="title-32">DISCUSSION</title><p hwp:id="p-39">We investigated the influence of anterior-posterior forces on gait adaptation and learning induced by split-belt walking at different slopes, which naturally altered leg orientation and forces when feet were in contact with the ground. To our surprise, each inclination group recovered their baseline leg orientation at the expense of step length symmetry, which was a profound finding given that step length asymmetry is considered a biomarker of inefficient gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Finley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">Bhounsule <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">Awad <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">Finley &amp; Bastian, 2017</xref>). These distinct leg orientations were likely self-selected to generate the forces for walking at the specific speed and slope set by each split-belt task. This was achieved by distinct adaptation between the leading and trailing legs’ orientation at foot landing, suggesting the involvement of different physiological mechanisms in the control of leg orientation over the course of the stance phase. It was also unexpected that propulsion forces, rather than braking ones, influenced locomotor learning, which was indicated by the larger adaptation and after-effects of the sloped group with larger propulsion demands compared to the one with larger braking demands. The key role of propulsion forces was further supported by the fact that subject-specific propulsion tendencies during baseline and early adaptation were predictive of individual after-effects. Taken together, our findings suggest that altering propulsion forces during split-belt walking facilitates locomotor learning. Therefore, interventions augmenting propulsion demands could be more efficacious in the rehabilitation of hemiparetic gait.</p><sec id="s4a" hwp:id="sec-25"><title hwp:id="title-33">The motor system prioritizes the control of leg orientation over step length symmetry</title><p hwp:id="p-40">All groups recovered their baseline leg orientation at the expense of step length symmetry, which indicated that speed-specific leg orientation was prioritized over symmetric step lengths. This has two key implications. First, step length symmetry is a gait feature that is not as valued by the motor system as previously considered. Specifically, step length symmetry is thought to be tightly controlled because subjects self-select symmetric step lengths even in asymmetric environments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58" hwp:id="xref-ref-58-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-58">Reisman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64" hwp:id="xref-ref-64-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-64">Savin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and those with more symmetric step lengths in these environments are also those spending less metabolic energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Finley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Thus, we surprisingly found that subjects in the incline and decline split-belt groups respectively overshot and undershot step length symmetry to recover baseline leg orientations. However, this finding can be explained by the impact of kinetic demands in shaping our movements, which is the second implication of our result. Notably, inverted pendulum models of walking suggest that subjects orient their legs to maintain a constant speed by equalizing positive and negative work over the gait cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">Kajita <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Donelan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">Kuo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">Kuo <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).

This is in contrast to sensorimotor adaptation of other motor behaviors such as reaching, in which adaptation and de-adaptation effects are mostly constrained to a single effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51" hwp:id="xref-ref-51-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-51">Nozaki <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80" hwp:id="xref-ref-80-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-80">Yokoi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79" hwp:id="xref-ref-79-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-79">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75" hwp:id="xref-ref-75-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-75">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).

Consequently, it is important to characterize the adaptation of each leg in tasks inducing locomotor learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58" hwp:id="xref-ref-58-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-58">Reisman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), particularly when targeting unilateral deficits on hemiparetic gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">Bowden <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Balasubramanian <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Another consistent observation in the analysis of individual limbs was that all groups converged to the same step length value for the leg walking slow during adaptation. This is exclusively observed during split and not tied conditions, indicating that this might be task-constraint of split-belt walking, which will be the subject of future work. In sum, split-belt walking at different slopes predominantly altered the adaptation of one leg and let to subsequent after-effects on the other leg, highlighting the bilateral nature of sensorimotor adaptation in walking.</p></sec><sec id="s4b" hwp:id="sec-26"><title hwp:id="title-34">Physiological mechanisms for controlling leg orientation</title><p hwp:id="p-42">Our results suggest distinct control between the leading and trailing legs’ orientation when taking a step because they transition differently upon sudden changes in the walking environment. More specifically, the leading leg’s orientation at foot landing (α position) exhibits smooth and continuous changes when transitioning from the split to tied situations in all our inclination conditions and other perturbation magnitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46" hwp:id="xref-ref-46-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-46">Malone <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), whereas the trailing leg’s orientation (X position) is discontinuous. This suggests that the leading leg’s orientation at foot landing is controlled in a feedforward manner–that is, it is planned before the movement is executed based on an a slowly updated internal representation of the environment. This is supported by the fact that sensory information about leg orientation at foot landing is sent to cerebellar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">Bosco &amp; Poppele, 2001</xref>), housing the feedforward control of movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Herzfeld <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and the fact that spinalized cats cannot adapt the orientation of the leading leg during split-belt walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">Frigon <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). On the other hand, the trailing leg’s orientation when taking a step could be determined by a combination of feedback and feedforward control. Consider that feedback mechanisms adjust our movements by transforming delayed sensory information into actions in real-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">Jordan &amp; Rumelhart, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">Bhushan &amp; Shadmehr, 1999</xref>). Accordingly, the trailing leg’s orientation is immediately regulated upon manipulations to ipsilateral sensory information from spindles in hip muscles, load sensors and cutaneous information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">Grillner &amp; Rossignol, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">Duysens &amp; Pearson, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Duysens <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54" hwp:id="xref-ref-54-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-54">Pang &amp; Yang, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62" hwp:id="xref-ref-62-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-62">Rossignol, 2006</xref>).

In particular, the feedforward control of step timing and hence that of the trailing leg’s orientation might be based on subjects’ expectation of the speed at which the belt is moving. Taken together, our results suggest distinct control mechanisms of the leading and trailing legs’ orientation when taking a step: the leading position is mostly mediated by feedforward mechanisms, whereas the trailing position is mediated by a combination of feedforward and feedback mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4c" hwp:id="sec-27"><title hwp:id="title-35">Motor adaptation and learning is facilitated in walking when manipulating propulsion forces, rather than braking ones</title><p hwp:id="p-43">While braking and propulsion forces were adapted in all groups, augmenting propulsion forces facilitated motor adaptation.

Our findings are at odds with these reports possibly because our participants experienced greater speed differences and were adapted at a more naturalistic walking speed (i.e., mean speed across legs of 1m/s vs. 0.75m/s). We additionally found that the incline group adapted faster, indicating that inclined walking also augmented the saliency (i.e., easier to detect) and/or sensitivity (i.e., quicker to respond) to the split-belt perturbation. The saliency of the speed difference between legs could be augmented in the inclined condition because its reduced cadence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">Kawamura <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70" hwp:id="xref-ref-70-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-70">Sun <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50" hwp:id="xref-ref-50-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-50">McIntosh <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56" hwp:id="xref-ref-56-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-56">Phan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>)(and hence longer stance times (i.e., period in direct contact with the environment), which increase subjects’ ability to perceive speed differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">Hoogkamer <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).

On the other hand, subjects in the split incline group might have adapted faster because they were more sensitive to increments in energetic cost due to step length asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Finley <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">Bhounsule <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), because incline walking has large energetic demands in and of itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">Johnson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Therefore, larger propulsion demands experienced by the incline group resulted in more and faster gait adaptation, indicating that altering propulsion forces during split-belt walking facilitated locomotor learning.</p><p hwp:id="p-44">The relevance of propulsion forces was also evident by the association between individual tendencies in propulsion forces during baseline and early adaptation and subject-specific after-effects. The positive relation between large movement disruptions in early adaptation and after-effects is well documented in error-based learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">Körding &amp; Wolpert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77" hwp:id="xref-ref-77-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-77">Wei &amp; Körding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">Green <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Conversely, the predictive nature of baseline features and motor learning is less commonly observed in sensorimotor adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">Kelly &amp; Sober, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78" hwp:id="xref-ref-78-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-78">Wu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Here we find that individuals biased to propel more or asymmetrically during baseline walking exhibit larger after-effects. We speculate that these baseline features possibly led to more adaptation and consequently larger after-effects. Consider that the split perturbation disrupts propulsion away from the baseline behavior and subjects adapt towards their original bias, as observed in other gait features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">Malone &amp; Bastian, 2014</xref>). Therefore, individuals with greater biases need to adapt more to approach their larger baseline bias. In addition, we observed that the asymmetric bias was in the same direction as the one observed during late adaptation. Thus, subjects that were more asymmetric might adapt more because they are more prone to adopt the asymmetric pattern needed to walk in the split condition. Of note, we observed a large range of propulsion forces during baseline and early adaptation across individuals, which might be needed to identify the reported association between propulsion forces and after-effects. In sum, our findings indicate that augmenting propulsion demands during split-belt walking facilitates gait adaptation and locomotor learning, suggesting that altering propulsion forces could be used as a training stimulus for gait rehabilitation.</p><sec id="s4d1" hwp:id="sec-28"><title hwp:id="title-36">Clinical implications</title><p hwp:id="p-45">There is an interest in modulating the extent of split-belt adaptation and learning as stroke subjects tend to only adapt to their baseline asymmetry during adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">Malone &amp; Bastian, 2014</xref>) and do not always respond to split-belt training interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59" hwp:id="xref-ref-59-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-59">Reisman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).

Importantly, incline split-belt walking requires more propulsion of the side walking slow in the asymmetric environment. Thus, incline split-belt walking could reinforce two target behaviors of the paretic side if placed in the slow belt: 1) longer stance time duration and 2) greater propulsion forces, both of which result in post-stroke gait asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">Bowden <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Balasubramanian <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Moreover, we find that incline split-belt walking leads to faster adaptation.

Our results also indicate that baseline features of individual subjects are informative about subject-specific capacity to modify their gait and learn new walking patterns, which is critical for understanding inter-subject differences in motor corrections post-stroke.
