The mechanism for cell-to-cell transfer is not understood. Here we imaged macrophages with CellTracker Green CMFDA-labeled cytosol to ascertain whether cytosol was shared between donor and acceptor macrophages. Analysis of several transfer events detected no transfer of cytosol from donor to acceptor macrophages. However, blocking Fc and complement receptors resulted in a major diminution of cell-to-cell transfer events. The timing cell-to-cell transfer (11.17 min) closely approximated the sum of phagocytosis (4.18 min) and exocytosis (6.71 min) times. We propose that macrophage cell-to-cell transfer represents a non-lytic exocytosis event followed by phagocytosis into a macrophage that is in close proximity and name this process Dragotcytosis (Dragot is a Greek surname meaning ‘Sentinel’) as it represents sharing of a microbe between two sentinel cells of the innate immune system.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="34"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Introduction</title><p hwp:id="p-3"><italic toggle="yes">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is a pathogenic fungus that is the causative agent of cryptococcosis, a disease that affects primarily immunocompromised individuals. <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> is a facultative intracellular pathogen that infects and reproduces inside of macrophages.

Whether cell-to-cell transfer favors control of infection, or promotes it, it is likely to depend on the circumstances of the host-microbe interaction.

Upon identifying a transfer event the microscopic images were isolated before, during, and after the transfer event (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Specifically, we investigated whether cell-to-cell transfer was blocked by the addition of an anti-CD16/32 monoclonal antibody, which prevents FcR function, in BMDMs. Transfer events were drastically reduced by blocking the FcR but interestingly, occasional cell transfer events were still observed. It is known that opsonized cryptococcal cells can be phagocytosed via complement receptor (CR) by a mechanism where antibody modifies the capsule and allows direct interaction with this receptor in the absence of complement(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>). To investigate whether this was the case, the experiments were repeated with complement inhibiting antibody (anti-CD11b) and both inhibiting antibodies.

Cell-to-cell transfer time was estimated by counting the total number of frames immediately prior to immediately after transfer. Each image was taken at two-minute intervals so the total time of transfer was directly calculated by the number of frames. We found that the median and mean transfer times were 11 and 11.17 minutes, respectively, from twelve total analyzed events (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-5" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). To our knowledge the timing of neither phagocytosis nor non-lytic exocytosis of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> by BMDMs has been previously carefully measured. To investigate whether the timing of cell-to-cell transfer matched the times of exocytosis and phagocytosis, we visualized phagocytosis by repeating the infection movie protocol but only adding opsonizing antibody immediately before starting image acquisition. We observed phagocytic events and counted the number of frames (taken each minute) to determine an experimental estimate of phagocytosis ingestion time. Based on eleven observed phagocytic events we determined ingestion occurred over approximately 4.18 minutes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-6" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Adding the time required for non-lytic exocytosis (6.71 minutes) to that required for phagocytosis (4.18 minutes) yielded 10.9 minutes, which is tantalizingly close to the measured average time of 11.17 minutes for cell-to-cell transfer, p &gt; 0.05 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-8" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3e" hwp:id="sec-14"><title hwp:id="title-15">A Model for Macrophage-to-Macrophage Cellular Transfer</title><p hwp:id="p-26">Our results indicate that cell-to-cell transfer is a coordinated process between two macrophages, that it does not involve the transfer of cytosol (e.g. Trogocytosis), and that it does not occur when the opsonic Fc and complement receptors are blocked.

Recently, non-lytic exocytosis was implicated as part of a process whereby phagocytic cells transfer <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> to endothelial cells resulting in a new mechanism for cryptococcal crossing of the blood-brain barrier(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>). Cell-to-cell transfer is a form of non-lytic exocytosis that has received relatively little attention, largely because it is difficult to study. In fact, the mechanism by which a fungal cell is transferred between two intact macrophages has been difficult to envision given that it involves a yeast cell in a membrane-bound phagosome that must cross two cellular membranes to travel from the donor to the acceptor cell.</p><p hwp:id="p-29">We considered several hypotheses for the mechanism of cryptococcal cell-to-cell transfer. Initially we were intrigued by the possibility that cryptococcal cell-to-cell transfer occurred via Trogocytosis, a recently described cellular communication process in which cytosol and surface proteins are shared between macrophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref>). Trogocytosis was previously shown to be a mechanism that intracellular pathogens can utilize and promote to spread between macrophage cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>). However, when we labeled the cytosol of macrophages and loaded them with cryptococcal cells we did not detect cytosol transfer from donor to acceptor cell during cryptococcal cell transfer. Shifts in the population data are clearly visualized in the accompanying density histograms which show no shift in cytosolic dyes before and after transfer events. It should also be noted that the shift in Uvitex 2B signal is immediately apparent despite the Uvitex 2B positive population (corresponding to the cryptococcal cell) accounts for a particularly small population of the entire region of interest (the entire macrophage). Therefore, even a small amount of cytosolic dye transferred to the donor cell would noticeably shift the population distribution post-transfer. Similarly, we could detect no transfer of plasma membrane signal from donor to acceptor macrophage in the experiments supplemented with membrane dye. The transfer experiments using cytosolic dye, combined with the lack of membrane transfer, essentially ruled out Trogocytosis as the mechanism of cryptococcal cell-to-cell transfer.</p><p hwp:id="p-30">Consequently, we investigated whether cell-to-cell transfer was a non-lytic exocytosis event followed by ingestion of the expulsed yeast by a nearby macrophage. In support of this hypothesis was the observation that expulsed yeast cells have residual opsonizing antibody in their capsule even after phagosomal residence and that this antibody could support subsequent phagocytosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>). When both FcR and CR were blocked no <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> macrophage cell-to-cell transfer events were observed. Although our conditions should not have contained complement-derived opsonin, antibody binding to the <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> capsule can result in structural changes that allow complement-independent phagocytosis through the complement receptor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>). These observations imply that cell-to-cell transfer is a sequential non-lytic exocytosis event followed by immediate phagocytosis from a nearby macrophage.</p><p hwp:id="p-31">Non-lytic exocytosis events were reduced, but not completely abrogated, compared to controls when macrophages were incubated with FcR and CR blocking antibodies. This finding suggested that blocking antibody binding was somehow affecting exocytosis, raising the possibility that the reduced transfer in the presence of blocking antibody was a consequence of fewer donor cells. Consequently, we repeated these experiments with macrophages from Fc receptor knockout mice. As previously stated, opsonizing <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> with 18B7 allows phagocytosis via the complement receptor so these macrophages can still be infected but will not be able to undergo cell-to-cell transfer relying on the Fc receptor. As hypothesized, we found that transfer events in Fc receptor knockout mice were reduced to levels similar to macrophages inhibited via antibody, while lytic and non-lytic events were not significantly lowered compared to control.</p><p hwp:id="p-32">Based on the reduction but not complete inhibition of transfer events when only the Fc receptor was inhibited we decided to investigate the contribution of complement receptor, hypothesizing that it could be used as an alternative but less efficient cell-to-cell transfer route. Wild-type macrophages infected with guinea pig complement opsonized <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> experienced cell-to-cell transfer rates similar to wild-type macrophages inhibited with anti-FcR antibody and macrophages from FcR knockout mice, while neither lytic nor non-lytic exocytosis events were significantly reduced compared to control. These data support our overall hypothesis that cell-to-cell transfer follows from coordination of a non-lytic exocytosis event followed by a phagocytosis event. Cell-to-cell transfer can be achieved through either Fc or complement receptor mediated phagocytosis, though Fc receptor mediated phagocytosis is more common.</p><p hwp:id="p-33">An exocytosis-phagocytosis mechanism allows us to discard more complex explanations. For example, we had also hypothesized that the phagosome directly transferred between cells, but this also does not explain our results as inhibition of antibody receptors should not inhibit the direct transfer of an organelle. If the cryptococcal cells were retained in the phagosome throughout the cell-to-cell transfer process, then the phagosomal membrane would separate the opsonized cryptococcal capsule from Fc and complement receptors on the acceptor cell surface. Another hypothesis entertained was that cryptococcal cells are transferred utilizing membrane tunnel structures between macrophages. A tunnel transfer explanation is unlikely given that tunnels were absent from our microscopy analysis. In fact, when cell-to-cell tunnels occur these tend to be too small for even cytosolic molecules to diffuse through(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>). In any case, a tunnel explanation is also ruled out by the fact that cell-to-cell transfer was abrogated by blocking cell surface opsonic receptors. Finally, due to the roles of Fc and complement receptors in immune synapse formation, we contemplated the possibility of cryptococcal cell transfer between macrophages via some type of previously uncharacterized macrophage specific immune synapse but concluded this would also be unlikely with respect to the data. Known immune synapses allow only small molecules and dyes to directly pass through. Particles larger than 32 nm are entirely excluded(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref>) which would also exclude cryptococcal cells.</p><p hwp:id="p-34">The measured time of cell-to-cell transfer also supports the exocytosis-phagocytosis hypothesis. We determined the average length of non-lytic exocytosis events to be approximately 7 minutes, which is consisted with the prior reported time of 4-12 minutes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>). Macrophage phagocytosis of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> took approximately 4 minutes, providing measure for this process for the first time. Last, we measured that total cell-to-cell transfer took approximately 11 minutes, a time that appears close to the sum of macrophage phagocytosis and non-lytic exocytosis of <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> times</p><p hwp:id="p-35">We have termed the exocytosis-phagocytosis phenomenon Dragotcytosis, to denote the fact that this is a transfer between two sentinel (Greek ‘Dragot’) phagocytic cells. A new name would also allow us to distinguish it from other mechanisms denoting cell entrance or exit, such as: Trogocytosis, non-lytic exocytosis, and phagocytosis. Dragotcytosis differs from other mechanisms of cell to cell transfer mainly in that it involves the complete expulsion of cryptococcal cells from one macrophage before engulfment by another.</p><p hwp:id="p-36">In summary, three lines of evidence indicate that cell-to-cell transfer represents sequential exocytosis-phagocytosis events: 1) we observed no cytoplasm transfer from donor to receptor cells; 2) the frequency of transfer events was greatly reduced by interference with receptors involved in phagocytosis; and 3) the time involved in cell-to-cell transfer was indistinguishable from the sum of the times involved in exocytosis and phagocytosis. The implications of this mechanism for pathogenesis and host defense are uncertain and may vary with the infection setting. Antibody administration can protect mice against cryptococcal infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref>). Comparative analysis of infected tissues of antibody-treated and control mice shows that the presence of antibody is associated with increased <italic toggle="yes">C. neoformans</italic> intracellular residence in macrophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref>). The increased prevalence of intracellular yeast cells was interpreted as reflecting more efficient antibody-mediated phagocytosis. However, our results suggest that Dragotcytosis could have contributed to this effect since fungal cells experiencing non-lytic exocytosis in granulomas could have been rapidly ingested by macrophages in close apposition to fungal infected cells. The fact that transfer events were completely absent between macrophages with inhibited antibody receptors has the interesting implication that these events may occur more frequently in hosts with robust antibody responses. Additionally, non-lytic exocytosis has been described with several other pathogens and Dragotcytosis could theoretically occur in other infections. For example, tuberculosis is a significant global disease in which intracellular pathogens can spread from lung granulomas, potentially through a similar mechanism. Whether Dragotcytosis benefits the host by promoting re-ingestion of expulsed cells or harms the host by promoting new cellular infections capable of spreading throughout the organism in a Trojan Horse manner is not known and probably depends on the circumstances when it occurs. Future research into Dragotcytosis should focus on elucidating what factors control the frequency or direction of transfer, whether there is a significant role for proximity of macrophages, whether there is a recruitment process for acceptor macrophages or specific surface markers upregulated by the donor, potential transcriptional differences between donor and acceptor macrophages or macrophages more likely to be donors vs acceptors, studying the process <italic toggle="yes">in-vivo</italic> for clinical relevance, and probing whether other relevant intracellular pathogens are capable of Dragotcytosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-17">Acknowledgements</title><p hwp:id="p-37">Quigly Dragotakes would like to acknowledge Gundula Bosch Ph.D, Clive Shiff Ph.D., and David Sullivan M.D. for the timely assignment of a Trogocytosis paper in journal club during his rotation in the Casadevall Lab which inspired him to investigate this phenomenon.</p><p hwp:id="p-38">Additionally, we would like to thank Carolina Coelho Ph.D. for sharing BMDM harvesting responsibilities on many occasions.</p></ack><ref-list hwp:id="ref-list-1"><title hwp:id="title-18">References</title><ref id="c1" hwp:id="ref-1" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-1-1"><label>1.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="387688v1.1" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-1"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Johnston S.
