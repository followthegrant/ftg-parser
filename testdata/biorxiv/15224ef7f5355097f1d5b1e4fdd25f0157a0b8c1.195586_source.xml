Here, we analyzed simultaneous central activity via electroencephalography (EEG) and autonomic heart beat-to-beat intervals (RR intervals) from electrocardiography (ECG) during wake and daytime sleep. We identified bursts of ECG activity that lasted 4-5 seconds and predominated in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM). Using event-based analysis of NREM sleep, we found an increase in delta (0.5-4Hz) and sigma (12-15Hz) power and an elevated density of slow oscillations (0.5-1Hz) about 5 secs prior to peak of the heart rate burst, as well as a surge in vagal activity, assessed by high-frequency (HF) component of RR intervals. Using regression framework, we show that these Autonomic/Central Events (ACE) positively predicted post-nap improvement in a declarative memory task after controlling for the effects of spindles and slow oscillations from sleep periods without ACE. No such relation was found between memory performance and a control nap. Additionally, NREM ACE negatively correlated with REM sleep and learning in a non-declarative memory task. These results provide the first evidence that coordinated autonomic and central events play a significant role in declarative memory consolidation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="28"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

Another direction of research has demonstrated evidence for a critical role of autonomic activity during waking in memory and learning. We have recently shown that autonomic activity during sleep may also be related to consolidation. What is not known is whether the coupling of central and autonomic systems during wake or sleep plays a role in memory consolidation. Here, we identify a novel coupling between the autonomic and central nervous systems during sleep, but not wake, that predicts the outcome of the memory consolidation.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">Research has consistently shown that a period of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep yields greater memory retention of declarative memories (e.g., explicit, episodic memories) than a comparable period of REM sleep or waking activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref></sup>. Several EEG features of NREM sleep have been linked with memory consolidation, with most studies focusing on spectral power in the slow wave activity (SWA, 0.5–4Hz) and sigma (12–15 Hz) bands, or specific events including hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (150–250 Hz)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup>, cortical slow oscillations (SO, 0.5–1 Hz), and thalamic sleep spindles (12–15Hz) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref></sup>. In fact, co-occurring SOs and sigma/spindles may be a key mechanism of memory consolidation during sleep <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">In humans, increases in sigma power during the SO up-states has been shown following learning of a declarative memory task <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, pharmacologically increasing spindles with zolpidem resulted in greater coupling of spindles and SOs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup> and declarative memory improvements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>. In rodents, the replay of neural activity from encoding during sleep has been proposed to occur through the temporal coupling of thalamic spindles, hippocampal sharp wave ripples, and cortical slow oscillations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, although a full mechanistic understanding of sleep-dependent memory consolidation is far from realized, research suggests that the coordination of brain rhythms from several cortical and subcortical regions may be critical.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">A different line of research has demonstrated a significant contribution of the autonomic nervous system for memory consolidation during waking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref></sup>. These studies implicate the tenth cranial “vagus” nerve, which is the primary pathway of communication between the autonomic and central nervous systems. The vagus communicates information about peripheral excitation and arousal via projections to the brainstem, which then project to many memory-related brain areas including the amygdala complex, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref></sup>. Descending projections from the PFC to autonomic/visceral sites of the hypothalamus and brainstem create a feedback loop allowing for bi-directional communication between central memory areas and peripheral sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref></sup>. In male sprague-dawley rats, post-encoding vagotomy impairs memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup>. In humans, vagal nerve stimulation during verbal memory consolidation enhances recognition memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup>. Thus, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) appears to play a substantial role in waking memory consolidation.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">We have recently shown that ANS activity during sleep also associated with memory consolidation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref></sup>. In this study, subjects were given a memory test before and after a daytime nap. Along with measuring central activity during sleep, we also measured ANS activity using the traditional approach of heart rate variability (HRV), defined as the variance between consecutive heartbeats averaged within each sleep stage, as well as during a pre-nap wake period. We found that vagally-mediated ANS activity during sleep 1) is associated with the consolidation of implicit and explicit information, and 2) is sleep stage specific.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Given the evidence of independent contributions of central and autonomic activity during sleep for memory consolidation, it is not known whether there is coupling between these systems and whether this coupling may support long-term memory formation. Prior work hints at a possible coordination between central features and autonomic activity. For example, auditory-evoked K-complexes were associated with increased heart rate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref></sup> and have been shown to appear frequently 250 and 650 msec after the onset of the P wave in ECG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the QRS complex of ECG has been shown to modulate sleep spindle phases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref></sup>. There is also evidence that the heartbeat-evoked potentials in EEG reflect cardiac function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, the high frequency component of heart rate variability, which reflects parasympathetic activity, has been shown to correlate with slow wave activity in the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, volitional effort during wake correlates both with increases in hippocampal activity and heart rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref></sup>; and phase-locking between central hippocampal theta and autonomic R-waves has been shown in guinea pigs during wake, SWS and REM sleep <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref></sup>. Together, these findings suggest that cardiac autonomic activity may be coupled with hippocampothalamocortical communication that has been shown to underlie memory consolidation during sleep. Despite these intriguing associations, very little is known about the coupling of central and autonomic activity and its functional consequences.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Here, we use a high-temporal precision time-series approach to examine coupling between central and autonomic nervous activity during wake and sleep and its impact on memory consolidation. Using this approach, we have identified novel cardiovascular events during NREM sleep, heart rate bursts, that are temporally coincident with increases in electrophysiological central events that have previously been shown to be critical for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In addition, these Autonomic/Central Coupled Events (ACE) are directly following by a surge in vagal activity, assessed by high-frequency component of RR intervals. Using a regression framework, we assessed the contribution of ACE events versus non-ACE central and autonomic activity to declarative memory improvement following a nap, and show that ACE events predict performance improvement to a greater extent than by either activity alone. No such relation was found between memory performance and a control nap. We, thus, demonstrate a heretofore-unrecognized important role of coordinated autonomic and central activity during sleep that supports declarative memory consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">Results</title><p hwp:id="p-10">We analyzed the RR (inter-beat interval) time-series from the ECG, and brain electrical activity from frontal and central EEG recording sites during a daytime nap in 45 young, healthy subjects (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref> for Study Timeline). First we assess HR using the traditional methods of analyzing HR in the frequency domain The total number of 3-minute epochs analyzed across subjects in Wake, Stage 2, SWS, and REM were 223, 415, 275, and 147, respectively. In the frequency domain, the low frequency (LF; 0.04– 0.15 Hz) component of RR is considered a reflection of sympathetic nervous activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref></sup>; but this is not universally accepted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref></sup>, while the high frequency (HF; 0.15–0.4 Hz) component reflects parasympathetic (vagal) activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref></sup>.

In agreement with this literature, we found that different sleep stages showed distinct properties in EEG and RR time-series frequency-domain.

The signature of these HR bursts was an increase in HR from baseline to the peak of the HR bursts (Wake: 21.62% (s.d.=11.05); Stage 2: 20.69% (s.d.=7.53); SWS: 14.49% (s.d.=6.02); REM: 21.40% (s.d.=8.85). The densities of the HR bursts for Wake, Stage 2, SWS, and REM were 0.71/min (s.d.=0.52), 1.04/min (s.d.=0.32), 1.11/min (s.d.=0.34), and 1.00/min (s.d.=0.38), respectively. Shapiro-Wilk and Chi-square tests on inter-event-intervals revealed that these events are generally aperiodic (Figure S1).</p><p hwp:id="p-15">Following the visual observation of the co-occurrence of HR bursts and EEG events we assessed the degree to which the HR bursts correlated with changes in EEG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-6" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2c-d</xref>). We found that EEG delta amplitude during HR bursts was significantly higher than during non-bursting periods of the RR signal in both Stage 2 (t(84)=2.14, p=.035)) and SWS (t(70)=1.70, p=.046), but not Wake and REM. Traditional measures of HR in the frequency domain examine LF and HF power by collapsing across time. However, given our interest in moment-to-moment changes in ANS/CNS signals, we filtered the RR time-series by LF and HF frequency bands (RR<sub>LF</sub> and RR<sub>HF</sub>, respectively), thereby maintaining the integrity of the time-series data. Similarly, we filtered the EEG time-series within the delta frequency to analyze the dynamics of the ANS/CNS interaction. We noted that during Stage 2 and SWS, bursts in delta amplitude co-occurred with large troughs in RR<sub>LF</sub> (corresponding to HR bursts), which were followed by increases in RR<sub>HF</sub> (see an example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-1" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). We further investigated this coincidence by examining the the phase/amplitude coupling (PAC) between delta and RR<sub>LF</sub>, where the slow frequency RR<sub>LF</sub> provides the phase and the faster frequency delta provides the amplitude. During Stage 2 and SWS, the distribution of delta amplitude in the LF phase was non–uniform and peaked at a preferred phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-2" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Across participants, the average preferred phase was -70.1°(s.d.=26.7°) for Stage 2 and -79.4° (s.d.=67.6°) for SWS. This also indicates that the elevation in EEG delta activity preceded the peak of the HR bursts (which occurred at LF phase of 0º). Interestingly, when we compared the density of the HR bursts to the traditional FFT analysis of LF power (i.e., likely sympathetic activity) within Stage 2 and SWS, total LF power was not significantly associated with HR burst density in Stage 2 (r= -.04, p= .81; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3c</xref>) or SWS (r= -.08, p= .64).

Specifically, we show 1) increases in the EEG amplitude in SWA and sigma bands directly preceded these large-amplitude HR bursts, 2) a surge in vagal activity (measured in the HF component of heart rate) directly following the HR burst, 3) that the uptick in autonomic/central events (ACE) (SO, delta, sigma) and vagal activity were positively associated with declarative memory improvement and negatively associated with non-declarative memory, and 4) ACE changes in the experimental nap were only associated with memory consolidation of information encoded on the experimental day, and not merely correlational. Together these results present compelling evidence of a coupling between signals from the brain and heart that have a critical and specific impact on memory consolidation during sleep.</p><p hwp:id="p-37">Traditional calculations of EEG/ECG signals in the frequency domain using 3–5 min bins of uninterrupted nocturnal sleep have found results that differ from the present outcomes. One such study reported no association between delta power and normalized HF power at peak of SWA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref></sup>. Also different from the present result, cardiac changes have been found to <italic toggle="yes">precede</italic> EEG changes by several minutes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref></sup>. Here, unlike typical HRV analyses that discard large changes in HR, we intentionally analyzed all artifact-free RR intervals, which allowed for the discovery of these HR bursts. In addition, we used a time-domain analysis within short 20 sec windows around the HR bursts to examine fluctuations in the EEG/ECG signals, which allowed for more fine-grained assessment of event-related changes in both signals. Similarly, using an event-related analysis in near-infrared spectroscopy, Mensen and colleagues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref></sup> reported an oscillating blood flow signal at HR frequency that was time-locked to the onset of slow waves. This study posited that the arterial pulsation evokes a down-state, or that a third generator regulating HR and slow waves may be involved. More in line with our findings, another event-based analysis revealed an increase in HR followed by a deceleration <italic toggle="yes">after</italic> spontaneous and tone-induced K-complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-38">By focusing on fine resolution of HR events for our event-based analysis, we found distinct bursts in HR during wake and sleep. HR bursts of similar duration have been identified in REM sleep in cats, with the average incidence rate of 1 burst per 6.1 min of REM sleep. These HR bursts were accompanied by ponto-geniculo-occipital waves and theta activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref></sup>, which have been associated with memory consolidation in rats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref></sup>. Our event-based analyses showed SWA modulation in both Stage 2 and SWS, and sigma modulation in Stage 2 by the LF component of the RR time-series. Our results suggest that the mechanism of SWA modulation was an increase in density of SOs, and power in SWA, and sigma activity ~5 sec prior to the peak of the HR bursts that returned to baseline directly after the HR bursts. In addition, there was no significant SWA modulation in wake and REM, which is not surprising due to low SWA activity in these stages. The characteristics of the SWA and sigma modulation in NREM sleep resemble the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref></sup> in NREM sleep which is characterized by repeated sequences of transient events and which clearly break away from the ongoing background rhythm recurring at intervals up to 1 min long. However, the average duration of SWA reactivation in CAP was reported as 12.66 s which is longer than our ACE observations. Lecci et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">34</xref></sup> found periodic sigma activity (but not SWA) that was more prevalent in Stage 2 sleep than SWS and associated with memory consolidation in a declarative task (human) as well as hippocampal ripple activity (in mice). The present results, on the other hand, identified a heretofore undescribed burst in HR activity, that correlated with prominent, aperiodic, ACE-related increases in SWA and sigma, as well as parasympathetic activity, that predicted gains in declarative memory during Stage 2 and SWS. Differences between findings may be due to the focus of the Lecci paper on periodic changes in EEG activity, as opposed to using ECG as the reference point for analysis. Notwithstanding these differences in approach and outcomes, both studies point to an important link between memory consolidation and autonomic/central events during sleep.</p><p hwp:id="p-39">The present data also showed no significant correlation between HR bursts and traditional frequency based analysis of total LF power. This lack of relation may suggest a dissociation between mechanisms underlying LF-related sympathetic activity and HR bursts. In contrast, the increase in HF power directly following the HR bursts may instead implicate vagal inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref></sup>. Although specific mechanisms of ACE events are not known, we speculate that overlapping neural pathways between brain and heart centers may be an appropriate place to begin, and further investigation is needed to tease apart these mechanisms</p><p hwp:id="p-40">Several candidate brainstem and cortical regions may be involved in the interaction between HR and sleep oscillations. One possibility, is that the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) mediate this interaction, since they act as one of the main bridges between CNS and cardiovascular systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">36</xref></sup>. NTS is one of the critical components of the central autonomic network with afferent and efferent connections to the cardiovascular system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref></sup> and it receives projections from many cortical regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">38</xref></sup>. Further, NTS, through its projections to RVLMs, influences activity in the locus coeruleus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">39</xref></sup> and indirectly influences the basal forebrain. Indeed, increased NTS activity is associated with reduced HR, and NTS stimulation has been shown to augment EEG theta and beta power during wake in cats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">40</xref></sup> potentially through the input to RVLM. The HR burst may be a consequence of increases in spindle and slow oscillations through wide spread cortical projection to NTS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">38</xref></sup>. On the other hand, one potential mechanism for SO reduction post-HR burst may be via NTS projections to basal forebrain and locus coeruleus. Stimulation of these areas by the NTS increases acetylcholine and norepinephrine release in cortex, which is known to reduce slow oscillations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">41</xref></sup>. Taken together, this suggests that the increase of SO prior to HR burst could mediate an increase of HR through combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways and that the reduction of SO following HR burst may arise from increased activity of NTS through parasympathetic output via the vagal nerve. However, several other pathways are known to be involved in the interaction between neocortex and heart and have be examined to make definite conclusions.</p><p hwp:id="p-41">A large prior literature suggests a critical role of the ANS during wake for memory consolidation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref></sup>.

Lesions of the vagus nerve impair memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup>, whereas pairing vagal nerve stimulation with auditory stimuli reorganizes neural circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">43</xref></sup>, strengthens neural response to speech sounds in the auditory cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44" hwp:id="xref-ref-44-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-44">44</xref></sup>, and enhances extinction learning of fear memories in rodents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">45</xref></sup>.

Recently, Whitehurst and colleagues used traditional methods to detect total sympathetic and parasympathetic power of the HRV signal during sleep and showed a correlation between parasympathetic activity during REM sleep (but not SWS) and implicit learning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref></sup>. In contrast the current study used a fine-grained temporal analysis of EEG/ECG signals to reveal how the coupling of ANS/CNS Events (ACE) significantly improved the prediction of declarative memory, but not non-declarative memory, over and above total power of HR components and sleep events alone. Importantly, these effects are specific to the encoded memories directly preceding the nap. Follow-up experiments require interventions to better understand the mechanism promoting these effects, as well as probing different clinical populations that may have dampened autonomic tone during sleep, including older adults and sleep apnea. Taken together, these findings implicate a significant role of ANS modulation of plasticity and memory consolidation during sleep that is likely mediated by vagal afferents to the cortex via NTS brainstem.</p></sec><sec id="s7" hwp:id="sec-11"><title hwp:id="title-12">Methods</title><sec id="s7a" hwp:id="sec-12"><label>A.</label><title hwp:id="title-13">Participants</title><p hwp:id="p-42">Data reported here come from the first visit of a larger, mini-longitudinal study that included up to 7 visits per participant.

The five most frequent male names, female names, and last names (e.g., Smith) were eliminated. Unisex names that are commonly used for both men and women were also eliminated, as were last names that are commonly used as first names (e.g., Thomas) or contain a common first name base (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">Richard</italic>son). Individual face-name pairings were randomly generated for each participant so that no two participants saw the same face-name pairs. During session 1, 44 faces (22 men and 22 women) were presented in the center of the screen with a first and last name shown below the face. The first two and last two face-name pairs were discarded after encoding (i.e., not tested) due to primacy and recency effects. Each face/name pair was presented four times for duration of 4000ms, with an inter-stimulus-interval of 500ms. Subjects were instructed to view each face-name pair and to do their best to remember each person’s name for a later test. Immediately following encoding, as well as after an 8-hr retention interval, subjects completed a recall memory test. During recall, 10 faces were presented and subjects were asked to recall the first and last names associated with each face. That is, they had the opportunity to recall 20 names (first and last names) total in each session. The ten faces tested in session 2 were different than those tested in session 1, the remaining 20 faces were not used. Total recall was calculated as the sum of first and last names recalled correctly. The difference in total recall between sessions (PM-AM) was calculated as a measure of declarative memory consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s7f2" hwp:id="sec-36"><title hwp:id="title-37">-Texture discrimination task (TDT)</title><p hwp:id="p-65">Subjects performed a texture discrimination task similar to that developed by Karni &amp; Sagi <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59" hwp:id="xref-ref-59-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-59">59</xref></sup>. Visual stimuli for the TDT were created using the Psychophysics Toolbox <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60" hwp:id="xref-ref-60-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-60">60</xref></sup>. Each stimulus contained two targets: a central letter (‘T’ or ‘L’), and a peripheral line array (vertical or horizontal orientation) in one of four quadrants (lower left, lower right, upper left, or upper right) at 2.5°–5.9° eccentricity from the center of the screen. The quadrant was counterbalanced across subjects. The peripheral array consisted of three diagonal bars that were either arranged in a horizontal or vertical array against a background of horizontally oriented background distracters, which created a texture difference between the target and the background.</p><p hwp:id="p-66">An experimental <italic toggle="yes">trial</italic> consisted of the following sequence of four screens: central fixation cross, target screen for 33 ms, blank screen for a duration between 17 and 600 ms (the inter-stimulus-interval, or ISI), mask for 17 ms, followed by the response time interval (2000 ms) and feedback (250 ms, red fixation cross with auditory beep for incorrect trials and green fixation cross for correct trials) before the next trial. Subjects discriminated two targets per trial by reporting both the letter at central fixation (‘T’ or ‘L’) and the orientation of the peripheral array of three diagonal lines (horizontal or vertical) by making two key presses. The central task controlled for eye movements.</p><p hwp:id="p-67">Each <italic toggle="yes">block</italic> consisted of 25 trials, each with the same ISI. A threshold was determined from the performance across 13 blocks, with a progressively shorter ISI, starting with 600ms and ending with 0 ms. The specific sequence of ISIs across an entire session was (600, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 167, 150, 133, 100, 67, 33, 17). A psychometric function of percent correct for each block was fit with a Weibull function to determine the ISI at which performance yielded 80% accuracy. TDT performance was calculated as the difference in threshold between Session 1 and Session 2, such that a positive score indicates performance improvement (i.e., decreased threshold in Session 2), whereas a negative score indicates deterioration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61" hwp:id="xref-ref-61-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-61">61</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-68">Subjects were given task instructions and practiced the task during an orientation appointment prior to starting the study. During this practice, the peripheral target was located in a quadrant that was not used during the study. This practice ensured that subjects understood the task and accomplished the general task learning that typically occurs the first time a subject performs a task. Additionally, on the study day, subjects were allowed to practice an easy version of the task (ISI of 1000-600ms) prior to starting the test session to make sure subjects were able to discriminate the peripheral target between 90% and 100% correct on an easy version of the task.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-38">Acknowledgement</title><p hwp:id="p-69">This work was supported by grants from NIH (R01AG046646), ONR (MURI: N000141310672), and Young Investigator Prize to Sara C.

For a periodic system, the Poincaré map (i.e., return map) of IHBI<sub>n+1</sub> versus IHBI<sub>n</sub> contains one point. In a corresponding biological system with noise, this single point becomes a normally distributed single-point cluster. The form of our Poincare´ map was considered to be a normally distributed single-point cluster if the datapoints along the Poincaré map axes passed a test for normality. Shapiro-Wilk test showed 38 out of 45 subjects did not have periodic HR bursts during Stage 2 (Figure S1a). The Chi-square test showed 43 out of 45 subjects did not have periodic HR bursts during Stage 2.
