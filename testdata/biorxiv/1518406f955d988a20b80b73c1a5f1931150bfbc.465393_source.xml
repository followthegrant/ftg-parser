Although most DDM implementations assume that only a single value guides decisions, choices often involve multiple attributes that could make separable contributions to choice. Here, we fit incentive-compatible dietary choices to a multi-attribute, time-dependent drift diffusion model (mtDDM), in which taste and health could differentially influence the evidence accumulation process. We found that these attributes shaped both the relative value signal and the latency of evidence accumulation in a manner consistent with participants’ idiosyncratic preferences. Moreover, by using a dietary prime, we showed how a healthy choice intervention alters mtDDM parameters that in turn predict prime-dependent choices. Our results reveal that different decision attributes make separable contributions to the strength and timing of evidence accumulation – providing new insights into the construction of interventions to alter the processes of choice.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="41"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

In the DDM, choices arise from a process that dynamically integrates evidence for and against each option over time – and a decision is made when the evidence signal reaches the threshold associated with one of the choice options. These models have been enhanced to account for various features of the decision process, allowing them to better explain choices and to generate new insights into cognitive processes. For example, gaze,<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup> and pupil dilation<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup>, and neural data<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>–<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref></sup> have incorporated the influence of attention and neural signals, resulting in improved predictions. See Ratcliff<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup> for a review of advances in the DDM.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">A key advantage of these models is their ability to dissociate the influences of distinct cognitive processes, such as distinguishing bias toward one choice option from reductions in the amount of evidence needed before deciding. Although current variants of these models provide highly accurate descriptions of the psychometrics of value-based choices (i.e., describe both choices and their response times in laboratory experiments), they do not account for important potential contributors to the choice process, including distinct contributions of different attributes to a single choice<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">Here, we present a multi-attribute, time-dependent, drift diffusion model (mtDDM) that modifies the traditional DDM in two ways. First, it estimates the rate of evidence accumulation at each time point (“drift slope”) separately for two attributes, which allows estimation of their unique contributions while controlling for other features of the decision process<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>,<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref></sup>. Second, the mtDDM allows each attribute to begin influencing the decision process at a distinct time (“drift latency”). This builds on previous work in which processing of irrelevant features must be inhibited (e.g., Stroop tasks), potentially through shifts in the drift process or two-stage diffusion processes<sup><xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>–<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref></sup>. Similarly, previous efforts to understand the temporal order of events in the brain – such as the timing of automatic and voluntary processes – have enhanced our understanding of cognition and behavior<sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref>,<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">A potential strength of the mtDDM is its ability to distinguish among different pathways that could each lead to an unhealthy choice. Most commonly, an individual could place a large weight on taste or a small weight on health. Alternatively, and non-exclusively, relatively delayed processing of health information might preclude its consideration in the decision process – leading to unhealthy choices that run counter to the decision-maker’s preferences. There also could be an interaction between decision weights and the timing of processing; e.g., an earlier entry of health information could compensate for a large weighting on the taste attribute. Any of these pathways could result in unhealthy choices, but cannot be differentiated in canonical models.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Dietary choices have several convenient features that make them ideally suited to testing the mtDDM; most importantly, they often involve conflicts between contradictory desires, such as short-term goals related to consumption of a tasty snack and long-term goals related to personal health. In our model, such conflicts can be represented as trade-offs in the separate weights placed on taste and health. Moreover, taste and health have meaningfully different properties, resulting in faster processing of taste than health<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup>. This may be because taste is a momentary, immediate, and concrete reward whereas the healthfulness of a food presents only future benefits and involves integration of multiple quantities such as caloric and fat content<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref></sup>. Although previous studies have estimated the time at which taste and health are processed<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref></sup>, they did not disentangle differences in the weight placed on each attribute from differences in timing parameters. By estimating both attributes simultaneously, we can assess their independent contributions.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">The predictions of the mtDDM are illustrated in the two plots of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Suppose that taste and health enter the decision process at similar times (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In this case, health influences the value signal toward the healthy option’s boundary early in the decision process, and the healthier option is chosen. In contrast, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-3" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1b</xref> depicts an identical decision process, except that health’s drift latency is much later, resulting in a large “temporal advantage” such that taste has 300ms longer to influence the value signal. In this example, the value signal has nearly reached the boundary for the tastier option when the health attribute’s latency has been reached. Health therefore would have a more limited time to influence the value signal before a choice is made in favor of the tastier, less healthy option (the top boundary).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;465393v2/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><title hwp:id="title-5">Examples of the decision process modeling within the multi-attribute, time-dependent drift diffusion model (mtDDM).</title><p hwp:id="p-11">In these example choices between a tasty food (tasty but unhealthy) and a healthy food (healthy but not tasty), a relative value signal (RVS) begins with a value set by a bias parameter (here, zero) and evolves only with noise, <italic toggle="yes">ε</italic>, at every timepoint <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> as depicted in equation and segment “a”.

Taste and health enter the decision process at similar times, which leads to an early contribution of the health attribute to the RVS, and a healthy choice. <bold>(b)</bold> In this example, all parameters are the same except that the taste attribute has a large “temporal advantage” of 300 ms. That is, due to a later entry of health to the decision process (at t*<sub>H</sub>=500 ms), it begins contributing to the RVS later than in the previous example. Thus, the tasty option boundary is crossed before the health attribute has a significant influence on choice. Figure adapted from<sup><xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-59-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-59">59</xref></sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="465393v2_fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-1"/></fig><p hwp:id="p-12">We tested the robustness of the mtDDM within an incentive-compatible experiment in which participants made a series of binary choices between two foods that varied on two key attributes: their tastiness and healthfulness (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-1" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. S1</xref>). Two behavioral primes were also employed to shape participants’ dietary goals via attention to either health or taste attributes, respectively. By focusing attention to each attribute in independent participant groups using a between-subjects design, we perturb the decision process, and thus can evaluate how well the mtDDM can adapt to changes in attribute weighting. Because drift slopes have been shown to vary depending on allocation of attention<sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref></sup>, an intervention that increases attention to one attribute could increase its rate of accumulation and therefore bias choice – independently of any effects of dietary self-control. We hypothesize that increased focus on the primed attribute may also facilitate faster processing of that attribute, and that these speeded latencies could help to facilitate more health-focused choices.</p><p hwp:id="p-13">Interventions directed at improving choice have found limited success, especially information-based interventions or those targeted at changing patterns of conscious thought<sup><xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref>,<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is critical to identify the mechanisms underlying what seem to be failures in dietary self-control – particularly if healthy choices might depend on something other than self-control or preferences<sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref>–<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref></sup>. For example, if healthy choices are facilitated in part by other features of the decision process, such as the time at which health information is processed, harnessing those features may aid in the development of effective interventions. This paper goes beyond introducing an innovation to sequential integrator models to also suggest ways in which the decision process could be nudged to improve choice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-6">Results</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-7">mtDDM Predictions</title><p hwp:id="p-14">First, we derived qualitative predictions for how our key new parameters – specifically, the taste and health drift latencies – interact with taste and health drift slopes to influence healthy choices. A series of simulated mtDDMs were performed using an artificial choice set with health and taste values like those in our experimental dataset. Taste’s slope and latency were fixed (to 0.08 units/ms and 500 ms, respectively) and health’s slope and latency was varied so that the influence of changes in the relative (Taste – Health) latency and slope on choice could be visualized (see Supplemental Information for details).</p><p hwp:id="p-15">When taste and health drift slopes are equal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2</xref>, purple line) agents made more healthy choices as health latencies became earlier (left to right). This pattern held when taste slopes were larger than health slopes (red lines). Importantly, differences in taste and health drift slope matter less for later health latencies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-2" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2</xref>, far left), and matter much more for earlier health latencies (far right). This indicates that as latencies diverge, the influence of slope changes, implying an interaction between the two parameters. Of note, changes in latency had a bigger effect on the attribute whose parameters were fixed, such that an exactly symmetrical effect would be obtained were health parameters to be fixed instead (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-1" hwp:rel-id="F6">Fig. S2D</xref>).

We indeed find that the influence of drift latencies on healthy choice depended on a trial’s RT; longer RTs were associated with increased likelihood of a healthy choices with late health drift latencies. Further, RT’s predictive power was reduced by a third and was no longer significant when drift latency-RT interactions were included in the regression (<xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-4-4" hwp:rel-id="T4">Table S2</xref>, Model 4; mixed-effects logistic regression, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">2</italic></sup><sub><italic toggle="yes">adj</italic></sub>=0.46, log(RT) slope=0.13 (s.e.=0.12), <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub>5846</sub>=1.05, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0.29; wanting slope=0.92 (s.e.=0.07), <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub>5846</sub>=12.52, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.001; t*<sub>H</sub> slope=−0.03 (s.e.=0.010), <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub>5846</sub>=−3.33, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.001; log(RT) x t*<sub>H</sub> slope=0.003 (s.e.=0.001), <italic toggle="yes">t</italic><sub>5846</sub>=−2.77, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=0.006).

No other parameter differed statistically significantly between condition (p &gt; 0.27). Together, these results provide no credible evidence that the health prime slowed the overall decision process, per se, but instead that the prime influenced the degree to which taste information influenced the value signal, both in absolute terms and relative to health information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" hwp:id="sec-13"><title hwp:id="title-22">Discussion</title><p hwp:id="p-38">Sequential integrator models such as the DDM have been used to understand the mechanisms underlying binary choices<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>,<xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">43</xref></sup>. One useful feature of these models is that they allow separation of different cognitive processes that drive choice. Here, we introduce a multi-attribute, time-dependent, DDM (mtDDM) which allows two distinct and often opposing attributes, taste and health, to be processed at different times and weighted differently in the decision process. We show that both the influence of an attribute on evidence accumulation and the delay before an attribute contributes to the evidence accumulation process differ significantly by attribute – and that between-attribute differences in these two parameters explain a large proportion of the variance in healthy choices. This indicates that models assuming the relative value signal reflects the total stimulus value – and not potentially independent attributions – may be unnecessarily limited in their explanatory power.</p><p hwp:id="p-39">Poor dietary choices are often attributed to the combination of two factors: strong preferences for the tasty foods that are endemic to modern society, and limitations in how well self-control mechanisms can inhibit the strength of those preferences<sup><xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-44-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-44">44</xref></sup>. Our findings support the alternative explanation that tasty dietary choices reflect not only of relative strength of taste preferences but also their relative timing<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref></sup>. That is, an individual may eat a cookie not because the desire for a tasty snack overwhelms their limited willpower, but because information about future health consequences does not enter the decision process sufficiently early to influence choice. Hereafter, we explore the implications of our results both for models of the decision process and for understanding decision making in the face of competing goals.</p><p hwp:id="p-40">Our findings have several implications. First, they generate the clear recommendation that slowing down the decision process may mitigate the effects of relative attribute latency or lower weighing of health, which could improve choices for some multi-attribute decisions. Further, this suggests a mechanistic explanation for previous work showing that the relative encoding of taste information in in value-related brain regions decreases when free response times are allowed and increases with shorter response times<sup><xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">45</xref></sup>, such as time pressure<sup><xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-46-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-46">46</xref></sup>, which alters parameters of the DDM<sup><xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">47</xref></sup>. Future interventions could either remove time pressure from dietary choices where they often occur, such as at a drive-through window, or extend the decision process by mandating a waiting time before choice.</p><p hwp:id="p-41">Second, we find that a prime that explains the importance of healthy eating can decrease the weight placed on taste information during evidence accumulation, facilitating more healthy choices. Such primes can readily be incorporated into choice architectures, allowing future work to test variations of this prime and its application outside the lab – which may provide opportunities for improving choice<sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-42">Third, we propose that the processes identified for simple multi-attribute dietary choices should exist for other decision domains in which values may be processed differently. For example, in financial choices, one must often make a trade-off between spending money now, and saving for the future<sup><xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">48</xref>–<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-50-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-50">50</xref></sup> – and, similar to what is seen for dietary choices, the future consequences of financial saving may not be as readily estimated as the immediate benefits of spending now. This may lead to a slowed estimation of the value of delayed financial rewards, and therefore more impulsive choices, regardless of an individual’s underlying preference for saving. Similarly, a multi-attribute DDM has been proposed for social decision making<sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref></sup>, and adding a latency parameter could extend this work. For example, the speed with which rewards for the self and others are processed and incorporated into the decision process may increase the model’s explanatory power, as well as individual differences in prosociality. Applying the mtDDM to different choice contexts, and with different forms of nudges, could help expand our understanding of both the decision process and how to improve choice.</p><p hwp:id="p-43">There are multiple limitations to the mtDDM that could be addressed in future studies. First, our model assumes that drift slopes begin at zero but transition discretely to some fixed weight following a latency period. However, many cognitive mechanisms could alter the drift slope over time. For example, attention has found to significantly influence the evidence accumulation<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup>. Second, plausible alternative models exist, such as one with a stopping time for an attribute’s consideration. Although we show here that the mtDDM outperforms a stopping time DDM, there may be other choice problems for which it improves model predictions. A time-variable drift rate<sup><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-51-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-51">51</xref></sup> could address both alternatives by assessing how drift slopes vary over time; for example, such a model could be implemented for dietary choice by down-weighting the taste drift slope once health information is computed. In addition, the mtDDM presented here assumes that taste and health combine linearly to guide choice. However, non-linear utility functions are often more robust<sup><xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-52-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-52">52</xref></sup>. For example, in monetary decision making, a hyperbolic model is often used to combine immediate and future value information into a singular utility to guide choice <sup><xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">48</xref>,<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-53-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-53">53</xref>,<xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-54-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-54">54</xref></sup>. Future work could probe the precise functional form appropriate for evidence accumulation.</p><p hwp:id="p-44">Moreover, previous work has found significant trial-to-trial variability in DDM parameters<sup><xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">36</xref>,<xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-55-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-55">55</xref></sup>. Examination of these fluctuations may help explain within-individual variability in dietary choice. For example, it is possible that when a healthy option is chosen, there is a reconsideration time that does not exist (or is different) for unhealthy choices and that could lead to a shorter health latency. Although we find that health’s latency is still longer, on average, in trials in which a healthy choice is not possible, and that latencies could be recovered even with such reconsideration times, examination of the various ways in which health information can enter the decision process would be a fruitful avenue for future research.</p><p hwp:id="p-45">Another set of potential limitations are methodological: interdependencies can arise between parameters in multi-parameter models. For example, smaller drift slopes and larger boundary widths could produce similar choice and response time patterns. This is also a concern with the mtDDM, although our successful parameter recovery indicates parameters can be estimated with at least some accuracy. Additionally, the current work presents parameters estimated using only choices and response times. Although this is convenient (both are readily obtained via standard methods for both laboratory and naturalistic experiments) it is also a limitation. This work could be extended by including neural signals, which may provide more accurate estimates or refinements to the model itself. Previous work using neural data to inform multi-attribute choices and models<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>,<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-56-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-56">56</xref></sup> are a promising direction.</p><p hwp:id="p-46">Finally, our work suggests that different interventions may work better for some individuals than others. For example, individuals with very slow processing of health information might benefit most from extending their decision process by introducing a wait time before choice. For others who weigh health minimally or not at all in choice, extending decision time may not substantially improve choice; instead, interventions would need to first encourage consideration of health information (in any form) through a mechanism such as priming. By broadening interventions beyond appeals to self-control to include a more nuanced consideration of the timing and strength of different attributes, researchers and policy makers will be more likely to identify methods for eliciting healthy choices.</p></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-14"><title hwp:id="title-23">Methods</title><p hwp:id="p-47">All procedures and stimuli were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Duke University.</p><sec id="s4a" hwp:id="sec-15"><title hwp:id="title-24">Participants and sample size</title><p hwp:id="p-48">Seventy-nine young adults from the Durham-Chapel Hill community (64% female; mean age 24.4 years) participated in this 90-minute study.

Ratings will be made using the keyboard. You’ll rate foods on their health, how tasty they are to you, and how much you would like to eat them at the end of the experiment. You have the option to rate an item as “neutral”, but please avoid that as much as possible. Rate each food based on how it looks on the screen. For example, when rating a picture of a plain piece of bread, tell us how healthful you think it is alone, not how healthful it would have been if it were covered in butter. For each food, you will be shown both an image and a text description. It is important to pay attention to both the image and its text description when rating the foods. This is because later in the experiment you may have to make decisions based on the text descriptions alone.</p></sec><sec id="s5a1b" hwp:id="sec-30"><title hwp:id="title-40">Choice Task</title><p hwp:id="p-66">[Either Health or Taste Prime Text; see below]. On each trial of this task, you will choose between two different foods. Press the one (1) key to select the food on the left, and the zero (0) key to select the food on the right. Your choices will be displayed as either food images or their text descriptions. The descriptions will be the same text descriptions that you saw in the previous ratings task. At the end of the experiment, you will actually receive your food choice from one randomly-selected trial across the entire experiment (from either this task, or next task).

We are interested in this question because leading scientists at top universities across the country have shown that eating a healthy diet is very important. They mention that one key benefit of eating healthy is the ability to maintain a healthy body weight, which can reduce the risk for many diseases. Previous research found that the top three killers in America are heart disease, cancer and stroke. Chronic diseases develop over time and are the cumulative effect of each eating decision we make in our lives. The health benefits of eating healthy are clear, but we would like to better understand how people incorporate health into each individual food choice.</p></sec><sec id="s5a2b" hwp:id="sec-33"><title hwp:id="title-43">Taste Prime</title><p hwp:id="p-69">The purpose of this study is to learn how taste affects people’s choices about the foods they eat. We are interested in this question because food is a central part of human culture, and is thought to be a source of enjoyment, passion, and fulfillment for many. Leading scientists at top universities across the country have found that high-taste foods reliably increase activity in the brain’s reward centers. This increased activity is usually associated with a boost in dopamine levels in the brain, and dopamine is closely tied to our brain’s reward processing, as well as our subjective experiences of reward. We would like to understand how food choice is affected by the rewarding aspects of flavor and taste. The benefits of eating flavorful foods are clear, but we would like to better understand how people incorporate taste into each individual food choice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5a3" hwp:id="sec-34"><title hwp:id="title-44">mtDDM Model Estimation</title><p hwp:id="p-70">In this model we estimated five free parameters: δ<sub>T</sub>, δ<sub>H</sub> t*<sub>T</sub>, t*<sub>H</sub>, and b. Best-fitting mtDDM parameters were estimated separately for each participant using the following procedure. For each unique taste-health rating value pair experienced by the participant during the choice task, 5,000 simulations were run for each mtDDM free parameter combination to compute the likelihood function over observed left or right item choices and their response times. All trials with response times less than 8000 ms and greater than 300 ms were used, and response bins were created using MATLAB’s histcounts. The best-fitting parameter set was found by selecting the set that resulted in simulated choices and response times that minimized the negative log-likelihood of the experienced trials.</p><p hwp:id="p-71">Parameter estimation was run in four stages. Stage one was used to find the maximum and minimum search values for each free parameter. This was done by running a coarse grid search for each participant and increasing maximum, and lowering minimum, search values until no participants hit the maximum or minimum value for any parameter. Based on this procedure, the maximum and minimum parameter values for each attribute (taste or health) to search over for stage two were set to: drift slope, [max(min(δ) - 0.1, 0), max(δ) + 0.1], drift latency, [max(min(t*) − 500, 10), max(t*) + 500]. Boundary width, which did not differ by attribute, was set to [max(min(b) − 0.2, .1), max(b)+0.2]. Noise added to each time step was set to be normally distributed around zero with a standard deviation of 0.1.</p><p hwp:id="p-72">Stage two served to find a finer estimate of each participant’s free parameters. The final grid, after expanding the maximum and minimum values as described above, consisted of every possible combination of the following parameters: Drift slope for taste, δ<sub>T</sub>, [.02, .16] in .01 increments. drift slope for health, δ<sub>H</sub>, [0, .16] in .01 increments, boundaries, b, [.4, 2] in .1 increments. Drift latency for taste, t*<sub>T</sub>, [10,2240], and for health, t*<sub>H</sub>, [10, 2230], both in 50 ms increments. To speed estimation, the subject’s maximum possible drift latency was re-set to the average response time for that participant if it was smaller, as a latency longer than a mean response time is not physiologically meaningful.</p><p hwp:id="p-73">The purpose of the third stage was to find the best-fitting set of parameters at a much finer resolution. To do this, the best-fitting stage two parameters for each participant were used to develop a very fine search grid. The grid for each parameter was set using the following procedure. For drift slope, the upper and lower grid values were +/− .01 the stage two estimates in .001 increments, excluding δ&lt;0; for boundaries, the upper and lower values were +/− .01 of the stage two estimate, in .01 increments; for both t*<sub>T</sub> and t*<sub>H</sub>, the upper and lower grid values were +/− 500 ms, in 10 ms increments, excluding t* &lt; 10 ms.</p><p hwp:id="p-74">The fourth stage used a nonlinear minimization search using MATLAB’s fmincon to search within stage three’s fine grid to arrive at the final parameter combination for each participant. For each participant, the top five best-fitting parameter combinations from stage three were selected. For each of these five-best combinations, the minimization was run 1,000 times, resulting in a total of 5,000 parameter estimations. The starting point for each parameter on each of these 5,000 minimizations was drawn randomly from a uniform distribution whose median was that parameter’s stage three best-fitting value, and whose maximum and minimum values were that best-fitting value plus and minus stage three’s step size.

This was done with a series of simulations, in which mtDDM parameters were used to predict the proportion of healthy choices made. In this analysis, health and taste drift slopes and boundary size were held to be equal. Taste latencies were fixed, while health latencies were allowed to vary. This allowed us to see, qualitatively, how changes in the relative latency of health would influence the proportion of healthy choices made, holding all else equal (see Supplementary Methods above).</p><p hwp:id="p-89">In <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-2" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figures S2a</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-3" hwp:rel-id="F6">b</xref>, the black line refers to simulations in which taste and health latencies were equal.

Conversely, the psychometric curve shifts to the right as health latencies became slower (in red), indicated an increase in unhealthy choices and taste latencies become relatively faster. The simulations also predict a pattern in response times that would be expected from value-based choices: specifically, that response times will be longer when both options are similar in value (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-5" hwp:rel-id="F6">Fig. S2b</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-90"><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-6" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure S2c</xref> displays the simulation in a different way to highlight specifically the proportion of healthy choices predicted (y-axis) relative to health’s latency (x-axis), which was varied in these simulations. Importantly, this also demonstrates how this relationship is also influenced by the value difference between the options. As mentioned above, taste latency was always fixed to 200 ms (vertical grey bar). As health latencies became faster than taste’s (to the left of the grey bar), the proportion healthy choices increased - even when the value of the healthy item was much worse than the tasty item (blue lines). Healthy choices declined as health’s latency became increasingly slower than taste’s latency or slower than (to the right of the grey bar). Of note, latency had an influence on choice even when one option was strongly preferred to the other (value differences of - 4 in blue, or 4 in green), and that this influence is strongest when both options are equally liked (light blue, value difference of 0). This further illustrates that earlier health latencies predict more healthy choices, even in cases in which the tempting tasty item was higher in value.</p></sec><sec id="s5b2" hwp:id="sec-43"><title hwp:id="title-53">Response Times by Choice and Trial Type</title><p hwp:id="p-91">Response times (RTs) were faster for conflict trials (in which there was a choice between a healthier, less tasty food and a tastier, less healthy food) than in nonconflict trials (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-3" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig S3a</xref>; M = 1558 ms, 1636 ms; paired t-test of log(RTs) d = −0.17, t(77) = −3.34, p = 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.08 −0.02]).

There was not a statistically significant relationship between the number of healthy choices made and RTs when making healthy choices (Pearson correlation ρ = −0.02, p = 0.86). However, participants who made more healthy choices took longer on unhealthy choice trials (Pearson correlation ρ = 0.26, p = 0.02). This is expected from any DDM with separate weights on taste and health and is the result of compounding of the weight placed on health versus taste during the decision process, a prediction we pursue below.</p><sec id="s5b2a" hwp:id="sec-44"><title hwp:id="title-54">DDM Predictions for RT Differences Between Choice Types</title><p hwp:id="p-92">Both the mDDM and mtDDM would predict the observed phenomena of slower healthy choices and faster unhealthy choices, given that individuals (on average) place a larger weight on taste than health in the decision process. To confirm this analytically, we performed a series of simulations to 1) assess whether a multi-attribute DDM can predict the observed RT differences between healthy and unhealthy choices, and 2) whether adding an attribute-wise latency parameter improves the prediction of these RT differences (above a multi-attribute DDM with one latency parameter). To answer these questions, we simulated RTs on each experienced conflict trial (in which one food was healthier and less tasty than the other). For each trial, 1,000 decision processes were simulated twice: Once using participants’ best-fitting mtDDM parameters, and once using participants’ best-fitting mDDM parameters (that is, a model identical to the mtDDM but fit with a single latency). We then compared the simulated RTs between healthy and unhealthy choice trials. For cases in which a simulation predicted no healthy or unhealthy choices, that trial type is omitted from the analysis.</p><p hwp:id="p-93">Both the mDDM and mtDDM predicted longer RTs for healthy than unhealthy choice trials (mDDM M = 2101 ms, 1836 ms, paired t-test of log(RTs) d = 0.64, t(30) = 5.33, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = [0.05 0.12]; mtDDM M = 2117 ms, 1804 ms, paired t-test of log(RTs) d = 0.71, t(31) = 6.00, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = [0.10 0.20]). This is expected, as trials in which the healthier option is chosen are more likely to have smaller summed weighted attribute values due to the small weight on health (i.e., small drift slopes), which will result in relative value signals that take longer to cross a boundary. As the healthier option approaches and overtakes the unhealthy option in summed weighted value, two things happen: first, the relative value signal is likely to take longer to cross a boundary due to more similar value differences and second, the choice is more likely to be in favor of the healthy option. For example, consider a participant with drift slopes of taste=0.02 and health=0.01. For choice in which the relative taste and health of the (healthy - unhealthy option) is [taste = −4, health = 4], this results in a total weighted summed value of 0.02*−4 + 0.01*4 = −0.04, which is in favor of the unhealthy option. For a value difference pair, in which the healthier option has improved in its relative tastiness, of [taste = −1, health = 4], the total value is 0.02*−1 + 0.01*4 = 0.02, which is a smaller relative value difference but now in favor of the <italic toggle="yes">healthy</italic> option. The latter case will result in slower choices in favor of the healthy option and is an illustration of how healthy choices are often slower, as their summed weighted value is often much less due to the smaller weight on the health attribute. Next, we assess whether multi-attribute latencies improve explanation of this difference in RT between choices.</p><p hwp:id="p-94">We investigated where specifically the mtDDM outperformed the mDDM by investigating RT and choice predictions by RT quantile. We note, however, that these comparisons do not penalize the mtDDM for its additional parameter, so therefore should be treated as exploratory. The mtDDM predicted larger differences in RTs between healthy and unhealthy choices than mDDM (healthy – unhealthy RTs, 170 ms vs. 286 ms; paired t-test of log(RT) differences d = −0.55, t(24) = −3.24, p = 0.003, 95% CI = [−0.09 −0.02]). This indicates that both models predict an RT difference, and that the mtDDM predicts an even larger difference between choice types. Next, we assess how well both models’ predictions match with the observed RT data.</p><p hwp:id="p-95">Observed RTs were correlated with those predicted by both the mDDM and mtDDM but were more closely correlated for the simulated RTs of the mtDDM than the mDDM.

For this, too, the mDDM does well, and the mtDDM does best.

This correlation is larger for mtDDM than mDDM predictions (Williams-Hotelling test t(76)=3.74, p&lt;0.001).</p><p hwp:id="p-97">We further investigated RT predictions for different decision durations. For each participant, we binned experienced trials by log(RT) quantile and then used both their mDDM and mtDDM fitted parameters to predict RTs for each experienced trial.

To see if this happened in the simulated dataset, we investigated cases in which an attribute had a larger drift slope relative to the other attribute, but a slower attribute latency. We calculated the proportion of simulated agents in which this attribute’s latency was falsely recovered to be faster instead of slower. Since, in this simulation, taste and health are arbitrary attributes, we collapse across both attributes for this test. Because parameter combinations were made randomly, this happened half (50) of our 100 agents, compared to our participant data in which this happened for an attribute only 14% of the time for either attribute. For the simulated agents, a latency was incorrectly recovered as faster for 4 of the 52 agents, for a 92% accurate classification rate overall. Altogether, this exercise indicates that although it is possible for a larger drift slope to result in a falsely faster drift latency, it is unlikely that this happens systematically due to mis-estimation of mtDDM parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s5b4" hwp:id="sec-48"><title hwp:id="title-58">Attribute Stopping Time DDM (stDDM)</title><p hwp:id="p-111">We compared the mtDDM to a model in which both taste and health enter the decision process simultaneously, but stop being considered at different times.

Specifically, longer healthy choice non-decision times could lead to health latencies falsely estimated as shorter (and vice versa in unhealthy choice trials), and therefore a false difference between health and taste latencies. We address this possibility with three analyses. First, we note that the imbalance in healthy and unhealthy choice trials in our dataset makes it ill-suited to directly estimate choice-specific non-decision times. Participants made on average 33 healthy choices (range, 0 to 140) and 115 unhealthy choices (range, 0 to 150). This would lead to noisier healthy choice nondecision time (NDT) estimates than unhealthy choice NDT estimates, and also would mean that participants with many healthy choices would have more accurate estimates for their healthy-choice than unhealthy-choice NDT, and vice versa for participants making many unhealthy choices. Future work with an adaptive design to ensure an equal number of healthy and unhealthy choice trials is a promising avenue for future work.</p><sec id="s5b7a" hwp:id="sec-52"><title hwp:id="title-62">Non-conflict trial mtDDM estimation</title><p hwp:id="p-119">If attribute latencies are a relatively stable feature of the individual’s decision process, participants should have similar attribute processing times if estimated from non-conflict trials only (that is, trials in which one option is not healthier and less tasty than the other; half of all trials). These non-conflict trial latencies should predict healthy choice in the conflict trials. Because nonconflict trials do not have the option of a healthy choice, it would be impossible to have the csNDTs (as there are no healthy and unhealthy choices). To address this, we estimated mtDDM parameters for each participant using their non-conflict trials only. For the one participant who had only non-conflict trials, 150 trials were randomly selected for this estimation. We found that taste drift slopes were larger than health drift slopes (M = 0.05, 0.02 units/ms; d = 1.43, t(78) = 8.04, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = [0.02 0.04]), and their difference was related to relative (taste – health) decision weights in conflict trials (Pearson ρ = 0.77, p &lt; 0.001). Crucially, taste latencies were faster than health latencies (M = 342, 609 ms; d = −0.94, t(78) = −6.25, p = 0.001, 95% CI = [−351 −182]), and their difference also was correlated with relative decision weights (Pearson ρ = −0.25, p = 0.03). This indicates that, even when there can be no csNDTs specific to healthy and unhealthy choices, latency findings replicate those found with the entire trial dataset, and are associated with the healthy choices a participant makes when confronted by a conflict trial. However, we note that there were very few trials used for estimation, so these results should be treated with caution.</p></sec><sec id="s5b7b" hwp:id="sec-53"><title hwp:id="title-63">mtDDM parameter recovery using csNDT data generation process</title><p hwp:id="p-120">We next used simulations and parameter recovery to test whether longer healthy choice NDTs would falsely recover as longer taste (vs. health) latencies (and vice versa for unhealthy choice NDTS). We did this by simulating choices and RTs as described in our mtDDM recovery with two changes. First, all trials were “conflict trials” so that all choices would be either healthy or unhealthy choices. Second, NDTs varied by healthy or unhealthy choice instead of by attribute. Then, mtDDM parameters were estimated from this data using the estimation procedure described above. This allows us to test whether a data-generating process with choice-specific and not attribute-specific latencies could result in differences in attribute-specific latencies (even though they were not a part of the decision process). Waiting times ranged from 100 to 500 ms in 10 ms timesteps which was chosen <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> informed by the range of non-decision times in our dataset (estimated from the single latency mDDM model which had a mean of 280 ms and within one standard deviation ranged from 101 ms to 468 ms).</p><p hwp:id="p-121">First, we note that true and recovered drift slopes and boundaries were correlated (Taste slope, Pearson ρ = 0.82, p &lt; 0.001; Health Slope Pearson ρ = 0.77, p &lt; 0.001; boundary Pearson ρ = 0.56, p &lt; 0.001).

This indicates that there is no credible evidence to support the hypothesis that longer csNDTS would lead to different attribute latencies. We do highlight, however, that there was a non-significant trend toward a correlation between longer health latencies and longer unhealthy choice NDTs (p = 0.08) in the direction we expected if a bias did exist.</p></sec><sec id="s5b7c" hwp:id="sec-54"><title hwp:id="title-64">mtDDM parameter recovery using mtDDM and csNDT data generation process</title><p hwp:id="p-122">For completeness, we performed a further simulation. This estimation was identical to the above, with one addition: taste and health latences were added to the decision process. This resulted in a DDM model with seven parameters: taste and health drift slopes, healthy and unhelathy choice NDTs, taste and health latencies, and boundary width. We then performed the same parameter recovery exercise to test whether attribute latencies be recoverd (that is, separately estimated) if both attribute-wise latencies and choice-specific NDTs exist in the decision proces. We find that, even when csNDTs are included, recovered taste and health latencies are correlated with their true parameters (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-13-2" hwp:rel-id="F13">Fig. S9B</xref>; Taste latency, Pearson ρ = 0.62, p &lt; 0.001; Health latency, Pearson ρ = 0.63, p &lt; 0.001, taste – health latency, Pearson ρ = 0.61, p &lt; 0.001). However, we note that this is a noisier recovery than one without csNDTS (mtDDM recovery reported above), and that both taste and health latencies are recovered to be faster than their true values (one-sample t-test of difference between recovered and true parameters vs. 0; taste latency, M = 180 ms; d = 0.38, t(99) = 3.81, p 0.001, 95% CI = [87 274]; health latency, M = 223; d = 0.46, t(99) = 4.61, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = [1267 319]).
