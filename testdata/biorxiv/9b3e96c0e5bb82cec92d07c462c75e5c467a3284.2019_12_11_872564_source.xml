Thus far, value estimation in animals has relied upon stochastic choices between multiple options presented in repeated trials and expressed from averages of dozens of trials. However, subjective reward valuations are made moment-to-moment and do not always require alternative options; their consequences are usually felt immediately. Here we describe a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction-like mechanism that provides more direct and simple valuations with immediate consequences. The BDM encourages agents to truthfully reveal their true subjective value in individual choices (’incentive compatibility’). Monkeys reliably placed well-ranked BDM bids for up to five juice volumes while paying from a water budget. The bids closely approximated the average subjective values estimated with conventional binary choices, thus demonstrating procedural invariance and aligning with the wealth of knowledge acquired with these less direct estimation methods. The feasibility of BDM bidding in monkeys paves the way for an analysis of subjective neuronal value signals in single trials rather than from averages; the feasibility also bridges the gap to the increasingly used BDM method in human neuroeconomics.</p><sec hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Significance</title><p hwp:id="p-4">The subjective economic value of rewards cannot be measured directly but must be inferred from observable behavior. Until now, the estimation method in animals was rather complex and required comparison between several choice options during repeated choices; thus, such methods did not respect the imminence of the outcome from individual choices. However, human economic research has developed a simple auction-like procedure that can reveal in a direct and immediate manner the true subjective value in individual choices (Becker-DeGroot-Marschak, BDM, mechanism). The current study implemented this mechanism in rhesus monkeys and demonstrates its usefulness for eliciting meaningful value estimates of liquid rewards. The mechanism allows future neurophysiological assessment of subjective reward value signals in single trials of controlled animal tasks.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-3">Keywords</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">BDM</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">second-price auction</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">bidding</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">ranking</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">choice The authors declare no conflict of interest.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="46"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

To achieve this, Goethe set a secret reserve price below which he would not sell the poem and asked the publisher for an offer. If the offer was above Goethe’s secret price, Goethe would sell it for that price. The publisher’s optimal strategy was to bid an amount equal to their value; thus, Goethe’s auction achieved the property of truthful value elicitation or ‘incentive compatibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">Milgrom and Weber 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">Karni and Safra 1987</xref>). By bidding more than their value, the publisher allowed the possibility of winning the poem at a price greater than their value, thus making a loss. By bidding less than their value, they allowed the possibility of losing the poem even if Goethe’s reserve price was less than their value; and would not reduce the cost, as the cost would always equal the reserve price.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Goethe’s method was a ‘second-price’ auction, whose various forms are staples of experimental economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Lusk and Shogren, 2007</xref>). The Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism (BDM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">Becker et al., 1964</xref>) is an equivalent ‘incentive compatible’ auction that directly reveals the subjective value of the good for the bidder. In BDM, the bidder’s stated value for a good is compared against a random computer price or bid: the auction is won if the stated bid equals or exceeds the computer bid and is lost otherwise. The BDM is increasingly used in human neuroimaging and allows experimenters to elicit true reward valuations and correlated brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Chib et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">Linder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Harris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">Tyson-Carr et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Other ‘incentive compatible’ means of value elicitation have depended upon repeated binary choice (BC) between various goods, whereby subjective values of individual goods are inferred from observed choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">Platt and Glimcher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">Kobayashi and Schultz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Lak et al., 2014</xref>).

It is therefore useful to have multiple value elicitation mechanisms which engage decision-making differently. In perhaps the most striking difference, the agent directly states the subjective value for the good in each BDM trial, while the value in BCs is only inferred from multiple choices. The direct value statement removes potential BC confounds, like complexity of presentation of multiple options, comparison between viable options, and satiety.</p><p hwp:id="p-11">Although invasive neurophysiology allows for finer mechanistic resolution, animal experiments have thus far been confined to BC tasks, and a neuronal basis of BDM bidding is missing.</p><p hwp:id="p-12">We investigated the feasibility of using the BDM with monkeys. Two rhesus monkeys bid different water volumes for the chance to obtain specific juice volumes in individual BDM trials. They used a joystick to move an on-screen cursor, thus specifying the volume of water they would ‘pay’ for specific juice volumes represented by unique visual stimuli. Both monkeys reliably expressed well-ranked bids, with distinct water values, for each of the five different juice volumes offered. Moreover, subjective values in the BDM were like those inferred from an equivalent BC task.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-7">Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-8">Animals and materials</title><p hwp:id="p-13">Two purpose-bred and group-housed male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), A (weighing 10.8kg) and B (weighing 7.9kg), were used for this study.

A beta distribution does not compromise the crucial incentive compatibility of the BDM (obtaining optimal outcome by truthfully bidding according to own value) but incurs a higher cost of inaccurate bidding (’cost of misbehavior’) compared to a uniform distribution without changing the points of maximal expected and observed payoff (see below <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-9-1" hwp:rel-id="F9">Fig. 9</xref> and <xref rid="figs9_1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-15-1" hwp:rel-id="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9-1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Lusk and Shogren, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">Tymula et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we generated computer bids from a pseudo-normal beta distribution, with support [0,1] and parameters (α = 4, β = 4), mean = 0.5 and variance = 0.028; the random number thus generated was simply multiplied by the maximum bid of 1.2 ml to generate a bid between 0 ml and 1.2 ml. Presentation of the computer bid was followed by a 1.5 s Budget epoch: if the monkey’s bid was higher than the computer’s, then the water budget to be paid was represented by occluding the area between the bottom of the budget bar and the computer’s bid cursor; otherwise, there was no change in the display as no payment was required. In either case the remaining volume of water was delivered at the end of the Budget epoch. Finally, trials ended with a 0.5 s Juice epoch which followed the onset of water delivery by 0.5 s. If the monkey had made a winning bid, then the fractal was surrounded by a red border and the indicated volume of juice was delivered. Otherwise, the fractal disappeared, and no juice was delivered at the end of the Juice epoch.</p><p hwp:id="p-26">For a given bid on an individual trial, the probability of winning the BDM, as well as the expected remaining water budget, are determined by the distribution from which the computer bid has been drawn. Thus, BDM bidding involves uncertainty. The bidder may learn the probability distribution of winning and losing the BDM in each trial; this aspect can be described as being essentially risky. With on-going experience, the uncertainty of computer bids changes gradually from initial ambiguity (when the distribution is only incompletely known) towards risk (when the distribution of computer bids becomes completely known), although it may reasonably be doubted that an animal can learn the distribution completely given the various demanding factors of the BDM task. Thus, an element of ambiguity (true uncertainty) may always remain present in animals performing in a BDM task. Such elements of ambiguity and risk are not present in equivalent BC tasks (unless they have been specifically designed so). This characteristic may make BDM performance cognitively more demanding and, depending on ambiguity and risk attitude, potentially less desirable than BC tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">Platt and Huettel, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2f" hwp:id="sec-9"><title hwp:id="title-15">Error trials</title><p hwp:id="p-27">Monkeys were required to maintain hold of the joystick from the Preparation epoch to the end of the Bidding epoch, and to always maintain the joystick in a central position, except during the Bidding epoch.

We started by presenting budget bars offering large differences in water volume and gradually reduced the difference in volume between the two offers as the animals came to reliably choose the option with the most water. This task taught the monkeys left/right movement of the joystick for the final BC task and confirmed that they understood the significance of the grey area of the budget bar. We also trained the monkeys in a version of this task in which both stimuli offered the same volumes of water, such that neither should be preferred.

The bids in BDM reflect the subjective reward value of the item the agent bids for or, more formally, the economic utility of the item. However, the metric of utility in our BDM was the physical amount (milliliters) of the water the animal ‘paid’ from the budget, rather than being utils. To express subjective value properly in utils would have required estimation of a utility function for water separately for each animal. While our monkeys show different degrees of nonlinearity in riskless and risky utility functions for various liquids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">Stauffer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">Genest et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Bujold et al., 2021</xref>), the current absence of an empirically estimated utility function for water would render the utility of the measured bids basically uninformative.

We used 1-way ANOVAs (MATLAB: anova1) to test whether mean bids for different juice volumes were different to one another in each of the 30 BDM sessions. For these and all other ANOVAs, we also present the omega-squared (ω<sup>2</sup>) measure of effect size for different factors. Post-hoc Bonferroni tests for multiple pairwise parisons (MATLAB: multcompare) were performed to find which juice volumes received mean bids that were significantly different to one another, thus reflecting how well monkeys’ bids discriminated different juice volumes.</p><p hwp:id="p-58">Within those sessions in which monkeys’ mean bids reliably discriminated all five juice volumes (i.e. all sessions for Monkey A and 21/30 sessions for Monkey B), we identified how quickly they achieved this.

To interrogate the effects of the starting location of the bid cursor on monkeys’ final bids more closely, we performed a multiple regression analysis (MATLAB: fitlm) on bids, with regressors for the juice volume (JV) and the interaction between each juice volume and the bid cursor’s exact starting position (SP<sub>JV=Xml</sub>), according to Eq. 1. For each animal, this regression analysis was conducted separately for each of the 10 random starting position sessions, finding the mean value of the coefficient for each regressor across sessions. As bid cursor position was expressed in terms of the corresponding bid volume, all regressors had the same units and scale and could therefore be compared directly (see Results).

In many tasks animals discriminate only between 2 or 3 different rewards. To approximate how well the BDM might be used to discriminate smaller sets of rewards, we performed the above analysis but taking combinations of 2 rewards, 3 rewards, and 4 rewards only, ignoring data for other rewards. For each session we again found the first trial by which mean bids for these rewards could be statistically discriminated in each session (<xref rid="figs6_1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-12-1" hwp:rel-id="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6-1</xref>), revealing an expected linear relationship between the number of rewards tested and the point at which all means differed significantly for 10 consecutive trials.</p><p hwp:id="p-81">Thus, the BDM could be used with fewer rewards to reliably distinguish bids using fewer trials. To further characterize the relationship between bid differentiation and number of bids for a given reward, we next looked at the first <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> trials for each of the 5 rewards for every session and used only these to perform Spearman’s rank correlation of bids on reward volumes, as well as one-way ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests, to identify significant differences in bids across the 5 juice volumes. <xref rid="figs6_2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-13-1" hwp:rel-id="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6-2</xref> shows the mean Spearman’s Rho (and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> - value) across sessions and the mean number of significantly different pairwise comparisons between all 5 reward volumes (and their mean <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> - values) for every value of N between 2 and 20.</p><p hwp:id="p-82">These analyses show that a significant positive monotonic correlation between bids and reward volumes was achieved in as few as 2 trials for each of the 5 rewards for both monkeys (<xref rid="figs6_2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-13-2" hwp:rel-id="F13">Extended Data Fig. 6-2</xref><italic toggle="yes">A, B</italic>).

Indeed, as suggested by the preceding analysis of smaller reward sets, reducing the number of rewards in the task would counter this.</p><p hwp:id="p-83">Beyond such a significant positive correlation between bids and reward volumes, we were interested in how quickly monkeys could correctly rank all rewards with their bids. Within each session, both monkeys’ bids ranked all 5 rewards according to their reward volumes long before the end of the session. For Monkey A, this was typically achieved by trial 18.5 ± 11.8, with a significantly positive correlation between bids and reward volumes at this point (Spearman’s Rho = 0.87 ± 0.08). Similarly, Monkey B typically required only 19.6 ± 12.4 trials to achieve this (Spearman’s Rho = 0.74 ± 0.14).</p><p hwp:id="p-84">Thus, the monkeys were both consistent in their ranking of rewards and in the precision of their bidding such that bids reliably reflected preferences and distinct subjective values for different rewards relatively early in each session, and within a single session of testing. These results demonstrate that monkeys were able to use the BDM to truthfully express reward values.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3b" hwp:id="sec-21"><title hwp:id="title-31">Development of final BDM task</title><p hwp:id="p-85">We used several successive steps to train both animals in the BDM task. First, they learned to associate different fractals on a computer monitor with different juice volumes. Then they learned to associate the budget bar on the computer monitor with different volumes of water. We also accustomed them to the sequential delivery of the water budget and the offered juice. They then learned to use a joystick in order to move the bid cursor and receive the different outcomes (win/loss) depending on the position of the computer bids relative to their own.</p><p hwp:id="p-86">We then introduced the monkeys to various preliminary BDM task versions, using essentially similar types of fractal stimuli for juices but different volumes of juice reward and different volumes of water budget. We limited initially the reward volume in each trial such that the animal completed as many trials as possible on a test day. In earlier, reduced versions of the task with only three juice volumes and a lower budget volume, the monkeys ordered their bids according to their preferences, but their bids were inconsistent and poorly differentiated (<xref rid="figs5_1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-10-2" hwp:rel-id="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5-1</xref>). We reasoned that while the relative cost of deviating from the optimal bid is unchanged by changing the budget volume, the absolute cost of a given deviation in terms of distance on the monitor, or movement of the joystick, is increased when larger rewards are on offer (<xref rid="figs5_2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-11-2" hwp:rel-id="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5-2</xref>). With successively larger volumes of juice and water, bidding behavior improved, both in terms of correlation strength between bids and juice magnitude, as measured by Spearman rank correlation, and in terms of separation of bids for different juice volumes. For example, in an earlier task version with 0.6 ml of water as budget, Monkey A’s mean Spearman Rho for the correlation between bids and juice magnitude was 0.46 ± 0.085, compared to 0.91 ± 0.02 in the final task.</p><p hwp:id="p-87">Similarly, for Monkey B, using 0.9 ml of water as the budget resulted in a mean Spearman Rho of 0.31 ± 0.26 for this correlation, compared to 0.81 ± 0.05 in the final BDM version. The larger volume limited the daily total trial numbers to 200.</p><p hwp:id="p-88">Due to time constraints in testing earlier versions of the task, we changed several parameters at once (including juice type, magnitude and timing of stimulus presentation and reward delivery) and were unable to implement each change alone followed by a significant period of testing. This made it difficult to attribute any improvement in performance to a single parameter change or manipulation of the task structure. Nevertheless, the improvements we observed using larger budget volumes in these unstructured preliminary tests guided our approach in using a larger budget volume for the final BDM task presented here.</p><sec id="s3b1" hwp:id="sec-22"><title hwp:id="title-32">Control for action effects</title><p hwp:id="p-89">Both monkeys’ bids discriminated all juice volumes regardless of initial cursor position (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-3" hwp:rel-id="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic toggle="yes">E, F</italic>).

In these sessions, the bid cursor appeared at a random vertical position, requiring different joystick movements to achieve the same bids from trial to trial. We regressed the monkeys’ bids on both juice volume (JV) and cursor starting position (SP) for each of the 10 R-BDM sessions individually, such that:

An optimal bidder’s BDM bids should perfectly reflect the value for the commodity (B<sub>1</sub> = 1) without any bias in bidding (B<sub>0</sub> = 0) (the value may, for example, be modulated by the mental and/or motor effort of placing a bid).

Previous experiments using the BDM method have not attempted to compare values thus elicited with those elicited by any other means and have simply taken the BDM validity as a given. Here, we show a high degree of concordance between the BDM task and the standard binary choice method of value elicitation in animals. Thus, the BDM in monkeys appears to provide a novel and valid mechanism for estimating subjective economic value in animal subjects.</p></sec><sec id="s3e" hwp:id="sec-26"><title hwp:id="title-39">Optimality of bidding in the BDM</title><p hwp:id="p-104">The incentive compatibility of the BDM rests on the notion that bidders benefit most by stating their value accurately for a given reward (Material and Methods: Optimal BDM Strategy).</p><p hwp:id="p-105">However, unlike human subjects in the BDM, animals cannot be made explicitly aware of the optimal strategy for maximising reward value. Instead, they adjust their bidding behavior according to the experienced outcome. Further, performance in the BDM provides less intuitive assessments due to its second-price nature, and BDM outcomes are risky because they depend on the computer bid drawn from a fully specified probability distribution. By contrast, stimuli in the BC task display the options in a direct and explicit manner, and the animal gets exactly what it has chosen.</p><p hwp:id="p-106">Therefore, we used the economic values estimated in the BC task to assess optimal bidding for each juice volume. Specifically, the optimal bid is equal to the PredictedBestBid stated above and is derived from the combined value of both the juice and the water budget, as expressed in common currency units of ml of water.</p><p hwp:id="p-107">To assess the optimality of BDM bidding, we compared each monkey’s payoffs to those of hypothetical bidders: an optimal bidder, who always bids the BC value for each juice volume according to the best BDM strategy; a random bidder, whose bids are drawn from the same uniform distribution for all juice volumes; and over-/under-bidders, consistently bidding ±0.2 ml for each reward (Material and Methods: Simulated Bidding). These simulated bidders faced the same 6,000 juice presentations and computer bids as the monkeys did across 30 sessions of BDM testing (200 correct trials each). We used pairwise t-tests, corrected for multiple comparisons (α = 0.5), to detect significant differences in payoffs between the different types of bidders for each juice reward.</p><p hwp:id="p-108">The differences between the average per-trial payoffs for the simulated optimal bidder and for monkey A were small across all rewards (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-2" hwp:rel-id="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic toggle="yes">A</italic>). These ranged from a difference of only 0.0059 ± 0.03 ml for the 0.15 ml reward, to a difference of 0.028 ± 0.063 ml for the 0.45 ml reward, however, the optimal bidder only secured a significantly greater payoff than Monkey A for the 0.3 ml and 0.45 ml rewards (all p &lt; 0.01). The systematic over- and under-bidders performed similarly to Monkey A, and never secured a significantly greater payoff, but the over-bidder had a significantly smaller average per-trial payoff for the 0.15 ml and 0.3 ml rewards (all p &lt; 0.01). The random bidder consistently secured significantly smaller payoffs (all p &lt; 0.01) than all other bidders (all results summarised in <xref rid="tbls8_1" ref-type="table" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-7-1" hwp:rel-id="T7">Extended Data Table 8-1</xref>; payoffs could not be computed for the 0.75 ml juice for this animal as the value for this volume was above the possible bidding range).</p><p hwp:id="p-109">For Monkey B (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-3" hwp:rel-id="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic toggle="yes">B</italic>), the absolute differences in average per-trial payoff between the optimal bidder and Monkey B were again small and ranged from 0.018 ± 0.052 ml for the 0.6 ml reward to a difference of 0.053 ± 0.11 ml for the 0.3 ml reward; the optimal bidder secured a significantly greater payoff for the 0.15 ml, 0.3 ml, and 0.45 ml rewards (all p &lt; 0.01). Monkey B secured significantly smaller payoffs than the under-bidder for the 0.15 ml and 0.3 ml rewards, and less than the over-bidder for the 0.3 ml reward (all p &lt; 0.01). Again, the random bidder secured significantly smaller payoffs than all other bidders for all rewards (all p &lt; 0.01; <xref rid="tbls8_1" ref-type="table" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-7-2" hwp:rel-id="T7">Extended Data Table 8-1</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-110">These small differences in average per-trial payoff were comparable to the juice delivery system’s error due to the variability of droplet size (SD = 0.06 ml per trial; Material and Methods: Juice-delivery error), which may have been too small to be perceived by the monkeys. Moreover, bidders that deviate as much as 0.2 ml (1/6<sup>th</sup> of the range of possible bids, from 0 ml to 1.2 ml) from their value are evidently still rewarded with payoffs of similar magnitude to an optimal bidder. Together, these factors limit performance in the BDM task, as difficulty discriminating small differences in payoffs limits learning of the optimal bid, and the cognitive and motor effort costs of placing precise bids may outweigh the benefits of doing so.</p><p hwp:id="p-111">To better appreciate the relationship between bids and payoffs, we can calculate the payoff for every possible bid, and for each reward, given the water values found in the BC task.

</p><p hwp:id="p-112">The overall expected payoff on a given trial is the starting budget in addition to the above ‘profit’ (which may be negative). The maximum expected payoff is always found where the bid is equal to the value; elsewhere, the relationship between a given bid and expected payoff is determined by the distribution from which computer bids are drawn. <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-9-2" hwp:rel-id="F9">Fig. 9</xref> shows the modeled expected payoffs given the Beta(4,4) distribution we used (magenta) for all possible bids and for each reward separately for both monkeys. It is apparent that payoffs may be similar over a wide range of bids close to the reward’s value; for example, for the 0.15 ml reward for monkey A, all bids lower than 0.5 ml grant an expected payoff between 1.15 ml and 1.2 ml. Thus, the 0.2 ml over- and under-bidding of simulated bidders are unlikely to experience dramatically different payoffs when compared to an optimal bidder. The red crosses in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-9-3" hwp:rel-id="F9">Fig. 9</xref> demonstrate that the monkey’s actual bidding fell within this optimal window.</p><p hwp:id="p-113"><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-9-4" hwp:rel-id="F9">Fig. 9</xref> also shows the payoffs given by bids drawn from a modeled uniform distribution (cyan). We used a Beta(4,4) distribution, which has a lower expected payoff for all bids and thus may help to increase the number of trials in neuronal recording experiments. Moreover, a Beta(4,4) distribution is associated with a steeper decline in payoff with less accurate bidding (<xref rid="figs9_1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-15-2" hwp:rel-id="F15">Extended Data Fig. 9-1</xref>) than the uniform distribution across most of the bidding range; the decline is particularly prominent in the centre of the bidding range where the monkeys suboptimally tended to cluster their bids in an earlier task version (<xref rid="figs5_1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-10-3" hwp:rel-id="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5-1</xref><italic toggle="yes">A</italic>). In conclusion, the Beta(4,4) distribution results in a steeper relationship between bids and payoffs in this range as compared to a uniform distribution; this characteristic of our Beta distribution increases the cost of deviating from the optimal bid and therefore encourages learning of the optimal strategy and hence optimal bidding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-27"><title hwp:id="title-40">Discussion</title><p hwp:id="p-114">This study shows that monkeys can truthfully report their internal, subjective economic value of rewards in individual trials by placing bids in a BDM auction-like bidding mechanism. The monkeys reliably and systematically ranked their preferences over five juice volumes, and their bids correlated well with values inferred from choices in an equivalent BC task, in keeping with the theoretical ‘incentive compatibility’ of both methods. While the monkeys’ bids were noisy, they nevertheless achieved a level of performance that approximated that of a simulated optimal bidder and well exceeded that of a random bidder. One of the difficulties in comparing behavior between BDM and BC tasks may lie in the inadvertent, unintended but unavoidable inclusion of ambiguity and risk in BDM that is not a necessary component in BC tasks but likely affects performance and adds uncertainty attitude to the choices. These experiments contribute a novel method of value elicitation for research on economic decision-making in monkeys and show the capacity of monkeys to perform auction-like bidding in resemblance to human behavior; indeed, human bids are also noisy, and unlike the results presented here, have not previously been compared to values elicited in BC tasks.</p><p hwp:id="p-115">Subjective value elicitation in animals has thus far relied upon the use of repeated choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">Platt and Glimcher 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">Kobayashi and Schultz 2008</xref>), inferring an average, single subjective value from dozens of decisions that are performed with some degree of stochasticity (whether in making the decision or executing it). However, decisions are typically made in single instances, weighing subjective values on a moment-to-moment basis, and usually have immediately tangible consequences. Accordingly, human experimental economics research considers decisions and assesses values in individual trials.</p><p hwp:id="p-116">To better understand the underlying processes in animals and achieve a greater degree of concordance in research across species, we need methods that elicit values within single choices. Moreover, while the BDM requires the decision-maker to generate a bid, and thus acceptable cost, in a continuous manner, BC tasks involve a more constrained discrete choice between only two possibilities. Thus, the BDM directly elicits a value, while the BC task only allows to derive value secondarily from measurable choices. It is unclear whether the valuation processes during choice between two options, and the underlying neuronal mechanisms, are the same as, or different to, those required to actively state a value for oneself as in BDM.</p><p hwp:id="p-117">These features of the BDM make it worth investigating in animals, but they also present unique limitations and challenges. Our BDM task required more extensive training than an equivalent BC task. First, because the placement of bids on a continuous scale is a complex motor task compared to simple left/right choices. And second, because the BDM’s second-price nature means that deviating from the optimal strategy is not strongly punished; for example, many bids that are too high still result in the bidder paying less from the budget than they think the item is worth, as long as the computer bid is lower than their value for that item. Thus, on any given BDM trial, over- or under-bidding may not lead to a loss relative to bidding one’s value (although it would lead to a loss in the long run). Conversely, choosing the less desired option in the BC task always leads to a definite loss relative to the preferred option. Therefore, up to a point, decision costs may even outweigh the benefits of precise bidding in the BDM; introducing an element of decision noise which may not be present, or as impactful, in BC tasks.</p><p hwp:id="p-118">The BDM provides a rich decision-making scenario which brings the scope of animal studies of decision-making closer to those in humans. At the same time, the complexity of the BDM offers new opportunities for study. Monkeys, at a basic level of reward function, have a globally similar brain organisation to humans, and the feasibility of a behavioral task used frequently in humans could provide unprecedented information about the role of single reward and decision neurons in auction-like mechanisms.</p><p hwp:id="p-119">Using a theoretically equivalent method to verify the values elicited by the BDM can only provide a best approximation, as any two differing methods are likely to be confounded by psychological differences. On the other hand, these differences may be the subject of future research. For example, while ambiguity has been introduced into BC tasks by occluding information in the two choice options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">Hayden et al., 2010</xref>), it is unclear to what extent animals are averse to ambiguity when they have some degree of control over this. In the BDM the monkey could reduce ambiguity by its own actions; by increasing or reducing its bid, the monkey makes the outcome of a trial more certain. Moreover, the effects of ambiguity on valuation in the BDM could be interrogated by changing the variance of the computer bid distribution, as reducing the variance about the mean increases the certainty of a given computer bid and reduces the ambiguity in outcomes for monkey bids that are distant from this mean computer bid.</p><p hwp:id="p-120">It is not enough to interrogate the activity of neurons in the presence of rewards; rather, for understanding reward processing, animals should reveal their preferences by making choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">Platt and Glimcher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">Stauffer et al., 2014</xref>). Besides conventional BC tasks, experimenters may now benefit from eliciting truthful valuation by different means while examining neuronal processes underlying those choices. It would also be interesting to see the extent to which the existing data from conventional BC tasks depend on their specific eliciting mechanism. For example, neurons encoding action-specific reward values have been identified in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">Samejima et al., 2005</xref>), but it is not known whether these reward values were specific to the decision rules and contexts in which they were elicited.</p><p hwp:id="p-121">Because monkeys in the BDM report values on a trial-by-trial basis, the task provides a closer temporal relationship to the activity of single neurons and allows to capture trial-by-trial fluctuations in value not visible with choices across many trials. The suitability of BDM bidding for neuronal recordings in monkeys is further supported by the current finding that action only affects reward valuation to a very limited extent; different actions, as required by different bidding start positions, did not substantially affect reward valuation in our task. Thus, the BDM task as presently designed might be an alternative to standard BC tasks when searching for fine-grained single-trial neuronal variations related to rapid spontaneous changes of subjective reward value.</p><p hwp:id="p-122">The reported meaningful BDM performance was obtained with substantial experimental constraints. Natural wildlife does not prepare monkeys for explicitly stating their values against some odds, even though animals always need to make some form of commitment to satisfy their needs. Their good performance highlights their adaptive cognitive abilities. One contributing factor might have been the seating for several hours in a primate chair that may have helped the animals to focus onto the task. Our use of tangible, ecologically relevant and familiar liquids may have also been beneficial, whereas it is unclear how the monkeys would have performed when bidding for more abstract items, such as tokens used in neurophysiological BC experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">Seo and Lee 2009</xref>). Thus, future work may help to delineate the conditions in which rhesus monkeys are able to successfully perform a BDM task.</p><p hwp:id="p-123">The primate BDM makes the link to human studies in several ways. Apparently, the relative closeness in cognitive functions between human and monkey would not only explain their successful BDM bidding but also allow for more direct comparisons with human neuroimaging studies, as the BDM is commonly used in experimental work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Chib et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Harris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">Tyson-Carr et al., 2018</xref>) as well as in consumer economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">Linder et al., 2010</xref>). Whereas human neuroimaging provides a larger overview of brain processes, single-neuron electrophysiology provides better cellular resolution for distinction of valuation functions in different neuron types. In this way, the current BDM data provide both an evolutionary and methodological link between the two primate species.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-28"><title hwp:id="title-41">Author contributions</title><p hwp:id="p-124">AAM and WS designed the study, AAM performed experiments, analyzed data and constructed figures, AAM and WS wrote the paper.</p></sec><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-42">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p hwp:id="p-125">We thank Aled David and Christina Thompson for animal and technical support and Alexander Pastor-Bernier, Raymundo Baez-Mendoza, Philipe Bujold, Fabian Grabenhorst, Armin Lak, William R.

Small volumes maximised the number of trials in each session before satiety set in; however, bids were not well differentiated, and the correlation between juice volumes and bids was weaker than in later task versions (mean Spearman Rho = 0.45±0.25).

We therefore doubled the water budget volume to 1.2 ml and used larger juice volumes, such that the range of juice reward values covered this wider range of possible bids. This led to a marked performance improvement, with mean bids for all juice volumes being significantly different to one another in every session. Moreover, the correlation between juice volumes and bids was markedly and consistently stronger than in the lower budget volume version of the task shown in A (mean Spearman Rho = 0.80±0.03).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="872564v3_figs5_1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-16"/></fig><fig id="figs5_2" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F11" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-11-1 xref-fig-11-2"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;2019.12.11.872564v3/FIGS52</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F11</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">figs5_2</object-id><label>Extended Data Figure 5-2.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-11"><title hwp:id="title-46">Increasing expected suboptimal bidding cost with increasing juice and water budget.</title><p hwp:id="p-127">The optimal BDM bid is equal to the value of the juice volume being bid for and will lead to the highest expected payoff compared to all other bids. The lower expected payoff of other bids constitutes an expected cost relative to the optimal bid. In the two BDM payoff settings shown in Fig. S4, the 0.3 ml and 0.75 ml, 0.2 ml and 0.6 ml, and 0.1 ml and 0.15 ml juice volumes elicited optimal bids that were similarly positioned on the 0.6 ml and 1.2 ml budget bars used in each task, respectively. This can be seen by the fact that the minimum costs for these pairs of juice volumes are at similar positions on the budget bar. For a given deviation of the final bid in terms of distance on the budget bar, the cost is higher in the 1.2 ml budget task than in the 0.6 ml budget task. This effect is more pronounced the further bids are away from the centre of the bidding range, because the mean computer bid was at the centre of this range. Moreover, the effect is exaggerated for lower bids for higher juice volumes, as the cost of losing a higher juice volume by bidding less than its value is greater.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="872564v3_figs5_2" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-17"/></fig><fig id="figs6_1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F12" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-12-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;2019.12.11.872564v3/FIGS61</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F12</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">figs6_1</object-id><label>Extended Data Figure 6-1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-12"><p hwp:id="p-128">Increasing the number of rewards increases the number of trials required to achieve consistent statistical separation of bids.

While bids capture the subjective value of juice in terms of water given a certain water budget, alone they do not provide a measure of utility. Nevertheless, it is possible that bids are non-linearly related to reward volumes. Here, we compared 4 different models; a simple linear model, a 1-parameter power function, a 2-parameter power function, and the Prelec function (which is usually used for probability distortion but can flexibly fit as either a concave/convex function - similar to power functions - or, as a sigmoid fit). These models were fit to all bids pooled across sessions as mixed effects models with random effects at the session-level. For each model we show the root-mean square error (RMSE); the Akaike information criterion (AIC); the Log likelihood (LL); and Beta coefficients (all p &lt; 0.01). We found the linear model to provide the best fit to the data for both monkeys, as it has the lowest AIC and RMSE. Thus, for further analyses, we performed regressions between bids and reward volumes on individual sessions using linear models.
