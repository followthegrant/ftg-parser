Here, using spatiotemporal pattern analysis of human fMRI data, we measured learning-related changes in hippocampal representations of overlapping real-world routes. We found that learning resulted in highly targeted representational changes within the hippocampus that specifically reduced similarity among overlapping routes. Strikingly—and in contrast to representations in other navigation-related brain regions—hippocampal representations of overlapping routes diverged to the point where overlapping routes became less similar than non-overlapping routes. This learning-related plasticity preferentially occurred for hippocampal voxels that were initially shared across overlapping routes. Collectively, these findings indicate that overlap among event representations triggers a divergence of hippocampal activity patterns that dramatically reshapes representational structure.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="47"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

For example, a single location (e.g., a living room) may be the site of many different experiences. The hippocampus is widely thought to play a critical role in coding overlapping events such that interference is minimized. Compelling evidence for this function comes from intracranial recordings in rodents during spatial navigation. For example, when rodents alternate between left- and right-hand turns in a T-maze, cells within the hippocampus differentially fire during the central stem (the overlapping path), according to whether the current route is a ‘right-turn’ or ‘left-turn’ route<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup>. Similarly, human fMRI evidence indicates that elements which are shared across multiple event sequences are distinctly coded in the hippocampus according to the specific sequence to which they belong 3. While these studies and others have led to general agreement that the hippocampus forms distinct codes for overlapping experiences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref></sup>, it is less clear how and when hippocampal codes become distinct.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">One way the hippocampus may minimize interference between overlapping events is by orthogonalizing, or pattern separating, neural activity patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref></sup>. For example, if two spatially-overlapping routes are orthogonally coded, their neural representations should be no more similar than those corresponding to nonoverlapping routes. A more extreme, and seemingly paradoxical, outcome is that hippocampal representations of overlapping events may be even less similar than representations of non-overlapping events. Why might this occur? When events are highly overlapping, this may create competition between event representations that the hippocampus solves in a targeted way by pushing representations apart from one another. By analogy, when two children are bickering, a parent’s reaction may be to move the children to opposite corners of the room. Thus, it may be that initial overlap among hippocampal representations triggers an ‘over-compensation’ wherein overlapping events actually become less similar than non-overlapping events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>. The idea that overlap triggers a repulsion of event representations has been referred to as ‘differentiation’ and is supported and inspired by computational models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref></sup> and a limited number of empirical observations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Importantly, hippocampal differentiation is thought to occur gradually, as a result of repeatedly experiencing or remembering an event <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref></sup>. This can be contrasted with the idea of pattern separation, where sparse coding in the hippocampus gives rise to an immediate and automatic orthoganilzation of activity patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, because differentiation is thought to be triggered by competition, neural activity patterns should change in a particular way. Namely, differentiation should preferentially occur for features within activity patterns that are initially shared across event representations. Indeed, differentiation can be thought of as an unsharing of initially-shared features.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">Here, we used a real-world, human spatial-learning task inspired by canonical rodent T-Maze paradigms to test for hippocampal differentiation of overlapping routes. Using spatiotemporal analysis of fMRI data, we tracked learning-related changes in the similarity of hippocampal representations of overlapping and nonoverlapping routes. We predicted route overlap would trigger a repulsion of hippocampal representations, with similarity among overlapping routes dropping below similarity among non-overlapping routes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>. Critically, while such a result would be readily explained by the differentiation account, it would not be explained by a pattern separation account. Additionally, to address the specific way in which hippocampal activity patterns changed with learning, we tested whether learning-related differentiation was related to the degree to which individual hippocampal voxels were initially shared across overlapping events.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4"><italic toggle="yes">Behavioral measures of route discrimination</italic></title><p hwp:id="p-7">In an initial behavioral experiment subjects studied sets of real-world routes that traversed the New York University campus. For each subject, the set of routes included (a) pairs that shared a common path before diverging to terminate at distinct destinations (‘overlapping routes’) and (b) pairs with no paths in common (‘non-overlapping routes’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Importantly, each route contributed to both conditions. For example, ‘route 1’ and ‘route 2’ were overlapping routes, but ‘route 1’ and ‘route 3’ were non-overlapping routes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Each route contained an initial segment that was shared with another route (Segment 1), and a later segment, including the destination, that was route-specific (Segment 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-3" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Although the real-world spatial locations of the overlapping segments were identical, the pictures for each route were taken at different times and therefore differed subtly in terms of pedestrians, vehicles, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-4" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and Supplementary Videos 1-8). Routes were studied twice per round for 14 rounds. Subjects were instructed to learn each route (i.e., the specific path to each destination) but were not told the destination at the start of the route. After each study round, subjects were shown individual pictures drawn from the routes and were asked to select the destination associated with each picture. Of central interest was accuracy for pictures drawn from Segment 1 of each route because selecting the correct destination for these pictures required discriminating between overlapping routes. Overall, subjects selected the correct destination (‘target’) at a higher rate than the destination of the overlapping route (‘competitor’) (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,21</sub> = 43.31, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.000002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).

Thus, despite the fact that overlapping routes were spatially and visually more similar than non-overlapping routes, the hippocampus represented overlapping routes as less similar than non-overlapping routes–a result we refer to as a ‘reversal effect’ because it is opposite to the inherent similarity structure. This reversal effect was not present in the 1st half of learning (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,39</sub> = 1.41, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.24), confirming that it was a result of learning (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-1" hwp:rel-id="F8">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> for hippocampal pattern similarity computed at a finer time scale).

Putatively, differentiation of event representations is a reaction to competition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">39</xref></sup>, with a competing memory subject to plasticity (and corresponding differentiation) to the extent that it becomes active during the processing of a target memory. Interestingly, however, it has been argued that this relationship between activation and differentiation is non-monotonic. Namely, differentiation is most likely to occur when competing memories are ‘moderately activated.’ When a competing memory is moderately activated, it is subject to inhibition that weakens associations with the target memory via the ‘drop out’ of overlapping features. However, when a competing memory is strongly activated, its features resist inhibition and the competing memory remains strongly associated with the target memory. Finally, if a competing memory is only weakly activated, there is little opportunity or need for plasticity to occur. This theory, has been referred to as the non-monotonic plasticity hypothesis and has been elegantly described in computational terms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref></sup> and can account for several empirical observations that are otherwise difficult to explain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">41</xref></sup>. We reasoned that this theory may also explain voxel-level changes across learning that were observed in the present study. Namely, within an individual voxel, we can think of a pair of overlapping routes as corresponding to partially overlapping assemblies of neurons. If the assemblies are highly overlapping, then presentation or processing of one route is likely to activate the overlapping route, via spread of activation. Although we do not have a way to directly measure the overlap of neural ensembles within a voxel, we reasoned that if a voxel responds similarly to two overlapping routes, then it is likely that the two routes are represented by overlapping ensembles of neurons (within that voxel). In other words, the degree to which a voxel responds similarly to a pair of overlapping routes may provide a clue as to the overlap in the underlying neural representations. If so, then following the non-monotonic plasticity hypothesis, we would expect differentiation to maximally occur for voxels that initially represented overlapping routes as ‘moderately similar’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-1" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F4" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-4-1 xref-fig-4-2 xref-fig-4-3 xref-fig-4-4 xref-fig-4-5 xref-fig-4-6 xref-fig-4-7 xref-fig-4-8"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;099226v1/FIG4</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F4</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig4</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-4"><title hwp:id="title-10">Voxel-level plasticity.</title><p hwp:id="p-18">(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of non-monotonic plasticity.

To do so, we correlated the timecourse of each voxel’s activity for each pair of routes, using Segment 1 data only (see Methods). For a given pair of routes, voxels with relatively high timecourse similarity were considered to be voxels that were more strongly ‘shared’ across the routes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-2" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Timecourse similarity values were first obtained based on data from the 1st half of learning. Voxels were then rank-ordered by 1st-half timecourse similarity and binned into groups corresponding to ‘weak,’ ‘moderate,’ or ‘strong’ values (i.e., the bottom 1/3, middle 1/3, and top 1/3 of similarity values). Importantly, this binning was independently repeated for every pair of routes, each region of interest, and each subject. Thus, a given voxel may have been strongly shared across one pair of routes but weakly shared across a different pair of routes. Timecourse similarity values from the 2nd half of learning were then obtained from these voxel bins, which allowed timecourse similarity values at the end of learning to be considered as a function of timecourse similarity at the beginning of learning. It is important to note that we did not measure changes in time course similarity from the first to second half, so as to avoid problems associated with regression to the mean.</p><p hwp:id="p-20">Within the hippocampus, 2nd-half timecourse similarity for overlapping routes significantly varied according to 1st-half similarity (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>2,78</sub> = 4.74, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.012), with the lowest levels of 2nd-half similarity occurring for voxels that were ‘moderately’ shared during the 1st half of learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-3" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Qualitatively, the relationship strongly matched the predicted non-monotonic pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-4" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). For nonoverlapping routes, 2nd-half timecourse similarity did not vary according to 1st half similarity (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>2,78</sub> = 0.28, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.76). An ANOVA with factors of overlap (overlapping/non-overlapping) and bin (weak/moderate/strong) revealed a significant overlap x bin interaction (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>2,78</sub> = 3.19, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.046), with the difference between overlapping and non-overlapping routes (the reversal effect) highly significant in the ‘moderate’ bin (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,39</sub> = 19.17, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.00009), marginally significant in the ‘weak’ bin (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,39</sub> = 3.62, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.064), and not significant in the ‘strong’ bin (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,39</sub> = 1.53, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.22). Thus, consistent with predictions, voxels that were moderately shared across routes at the beginning of learning exhibited the strongest differentiation.

In PPA, patterns remained relatively stable as voxels that were moderately shared in the 1st half of learning remained moderately shared in the 2nd half of learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-5" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-21">To more formally assess the non-monotonic relationship between 1st-half and 2nd-half timecourse similarity, we used a Bayesian curve-fitting algorithm-the Probablistic Curve Induction and Testing Tooblbox (P-CIT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">42</xref></sup>–that was specifically developed to test for non-monotonic relationships. Relative to quadratic trend analyses, the P-CIT algorithm has important advantages. Namely, the P-CIT algorithm allows for more detailed specification of a predicted curve shape, by explicitly including a set of curve parameters. In our case, the parameters describe the relationship between first-half timecourse similarity (x-axis) and second-half timecourse similarity (y-axis). Consistent with prior usage of the P-CIT algorithm 41, we parameterized the predicted curve shape as one in which the function, when moving from left to right, drops below the initial start value and then rises above the start value. The ‘dip’ in the middle of the curve reflects the prediction that differentiation (in the second-half of learning) should be greatest for voxels that were ‘moderately’ shared at the beginning of learning. The rise above the starting point after the ‘dip’ reflects the prediction that voxels that were strongly shared at the beginning of learning will remain (relatively) strongly shared at the end of learning. Using the specified curve parameters, the algorithm estimates a probability distribution over curves, conditional on the observed data. To assess evidence in favor of the predicted curve shape, the algorithm labels each sample curve as theory consistent (in our case, if it drops below the starting value and then rises above the starting value) or inconsistent and then computes a log Bayes factor value that represents the log ratio of evidence in favor of or against the predicted shape. Positive log Bayes factor values indicate greater evidence in favor of the theory. For this analysis, we re-binned all of the 1st half timecourse similarity values into 60 bins (5 voxels per bin) in order to allow for greater variability in the observed curve shape. This analysis used data aggregated across all subjects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-22">The estimated curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-6" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>) was consistent with the predicted curve shape (log Bayes factor = 1.51) and explained a significant amount of variance in the actual data (<italic toggle="yes">χ</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup> = 11.13, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0008). We next ran a permutation test to estimate the null distribution of theory consistency values. Out of 500 permutations, only 2.6% yielded log Bayes factor values that matched or exceeded the value obtained from the un-permuted data, indicating that it was unlikely to obtain this level of support for the predicted curve shape by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-7" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Finally, to assesses the population-level reliability of the non-monotonic curve we ran a bootstrap resampling test in which we iteratively resampled data from subjects with replacement and then computed the log Bayes factor value for each iteration. Four-hundred and eighty-eight of the 500 bootstrap iterations (97.6%) yielded positive Bayes factor values. Thus, the curve-fitting analyses provided converging evidence for the predicted non-monotonic relationship between voxel overlap at the beginning vs. end of learning: hippocampal voxels that were ‘moderately shared’ across overlapping routes at the beginning of learning were the ‘least shared’ by the end of learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" hwp:id="sec-6"><title hwp:id="title-11">DISCUSSION</title><p hwp:id="p-23">Here, across two fMRI studies, we found that hippocampal representations of overlapping spatial routes dramatically diverged with learning-to the point that overlapping routes were coded as less similar than non-overlapping routes. This ‘reversal effect’ was clearly a result of learning as it was only evident after subjects gained considerable familiarity with the routes and it paralleled behavioral improvement in memory-based route discrimination. The result was also selective to the hippocampus, with no evidence of a reversal effect in PPA. Finally, using a novel analysis approach, we show that the learning-related divergence of hippocampal activity patterns was most likely to occur for voxels that were moderately shared across overlapping routes at the beginning of learning.</p><p hwp:id="p-24">Several aspects of the stimuli we used and the analyses we employed are critical for the interpretation of our results. First, our analysis approach specifically compared representations of overlapping events to representations of nonoverlapping events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>. This allowed for learning-related changes to be expressed relative to a meaningful baseline. Indeed, the fact that hippocampal representations of visually- and spatially-overlapping routes became less similar than routes that contained no spatial overlap or visual similarity is not only striking, but it provides important insight into the underlying mechanism (a point we detail below). Second, our design did not involve separate sets of routes for the overlapping and nonoverlapping comparisons; rather, each route was included in each ‘condition.’ For example, the comparison of routes 1 and 2 was a comparison of overlapping routes, whereas the comparison of routes 1 and 3 was a comparison of non-overlapping routes. As such, any observed differences between overlapping and non-overlapping routes cannot be attributed to differences between the actual stimuli or to differences in attention, familiarity, vigilance, etc. It is also of note that our findings generalized across different sets of stimuli (experiments 1 and 2). Lastly, for our critical comparison of overlapping vs. non-overlapping routes, we only considered spatiotemporal activity patterns during the overlapping segments of the routes (Segment 1 data)-that is, before the overlapping routes diverged. Indeed, once the overlapping routes diverged (Segment 2 data), the hippocampal reversal effect ‘disappeared’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5" hwp:id="xref-fig-9-2" hwp:rel-id="F9">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, hippocampal representations of overlapping routes were most dissimilar when routes actually overlapped, clearly indicating that the reversal effect was triggered by event overlap.</p><p hwp:id="p-25">The mechanism that has most frequently been associated with disambiguating hippocampal representations is pattern separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref></sup>. However, the reversal effect we observed in the hippocampus is not readily explained by pattern separation. Rather, ‘perfectly’ pattern-separated representations of overlapping routes should have similarity values at-but not below-the similarity values for non-overlapping routes. In other words, pattern separation should only reduce global similarity among route representations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">43</xref></sup>. It has also been argued that hippocampal activity patterns for overlapping events become disambiguated as event-specific contextual elements are learned and relational networks are formed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref></sup>. Contextual elements may include event outcomes, locations, rewards, etc. However, because overlapping routes inherently shared more contextual features than non-overlapping routes, the observed reversal effect is difficult to explain based on a simple context-learning account. A related possibility is that hippocampal activity patterns reflected predictions about route destinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">38</xref></sup>. However, we did not observe any evidence in favor of destination coding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS8" hwp:id="xref-fig-12-2" hwp:rel-id="F12">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>) and, again, this account does not explain the reversal effect we observed. Rather, associating each route with a unique destination would only reduce global similarity among routes, similar to pattern separation or context learning. Thus, at least in the present study, hippocampal activity patterns appeared to reflect route information other than predicted destinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-26">In contrast to accounts based on pattern separation, context learning, or destination coding, a differentiation account readily explains several critical aspects of our findings. First, according to a differentiation account, learning should result in highly-targeted representational changes where overlapping events are specifically distanced from one another. This prediction is supported by our observation of selective learning-related decreases among overlapping route representations in the hippocampus. Second, if sufficient differentiation occurs, overlapping events should become less similar than non-overlapping events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-7" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>. The observed reversal effect is therefore naturally explained by differentiation. Third, differentiation is thought to occur incrementally over the course of learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref></sup>. This can be contrasted with the idea that pattern separation reflects an automatic orthogonalization that occurs during initial event encoding owing to sparse coding within the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref></sup>. In other words, whereas differentiation is inherently a learning phenomenon, pattern separation is not. Our results clearly provide evidence of learning-related changes, consistent with the idea of differentiation. Indeed, the reversal effect only began to emerge after routes had been presented approximately 20 times (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-2" hwp:rel-id="F8">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, differentiation occurred quite slowly. One question raised by the slow time scale of differentiation is why hippocampal representations continued to diverge once overlapping route representations were no more similar than non-overlapping route representations? While speculative, it is possible that the divergence of hippocampal route representations may have been influenced by similarity among representations within input regions. For example, within PPA overlapping route representations tended to remain more similar than non-overlapping route representations even during the 2nd-half of learning.</p><p hwp:id="p-27">While our findings are highly consistent with a differentiation account, it is important to emphasize that our results do not argue against a role for pattern separation, context learning or destination coding. Indeed, the lack of greater hippocampal pattern similarity among overlapping compared to non-overlapping routes at the beginning of learning may reflect an initial orthogonalization (pattern separation) of the route representations, with differentiation being additive to this initial orthogonalization. On the flip side, by establishing a role for hippocampal differentiation in a task closely modeled after rodent spatial learning paradigms, our results raise the important possibility that prior reports of pattern separation in the rodent hippocampus during spatial learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref></sup> might also reflect, at least in part, an influence of differentiation.</p><p hwp:id="p-28">Beyond characterizing pattern similarity across voxels, a novel aspect of the present study is that we identified how responses within individual hippocampal voxels were reconfigured over the course of learning to produce pattern-level differentiation. Specifically, we observed a non-monotonic relationship in the similarly with which individual voxels responded to pairs of overlapping routes at the beginning vs. end of learning. Voxels that initially had ‘moderate’ levels of timecourse similarity were the voxels that exhibited the lowest timecourse similarity (or greatest differentiation) by the end of learning. This analysis was motivated by theoretical arguments and empirical evidence that plasticity in a competing memory’s representation is non-monotonically related to its activation, with plasticity preferentially occurring when competing memories (or corresponding neural ensembles) are moderately activated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref></sup>. While our analysis was inspired by this theoretical prediction, our analysis differed from prior examples in that we considered plasticity at the level of individual voxels as opposed to ‘network level’ memory strength or differentiation. Additionally, our analysis did not directly measure activation of competing memories; instead we used timecourse similarity as a way to infer when activation of competing neural ensembles was most likely to occur. Namely, we reasoned that timecourse similarity at the beginning of learning would be related to the degree of overlap among underlying neural ensembles (within a given voxel) and, therefore, to the probability that viewing one route would result in ‘spill over’ of activation to the competing neural ensemble. While our predictions were predicated on this assumption, the observed function was strongly consistent with the predicted nonmonotonic relationship. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence of non-monotonic plasticity within the hippocampus.</p><p hwp:id="p-29">A final question concerns the nature of information coded for by the hippocampus. That is, what kinds of information were reflected in hippocampal activity patterns? Several prior studies have demonstrated spatial coding within the human hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44" hwp:id="xref-ref-44-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">48</xref></sup>. Here, our findings appear to be at odds with a spatial coding account in that hippocampal activity patterns diverged precisely when routes were spatially overlapping. However, it is possible that when routes overlap the hippocampus forms separate spatial reference frames for each route. Thus, hippocampal activity patterns in the present study may have reflected spatial codes if overlapping routes were represented within distinct maps. Alternatively, the hippocampus may have coded for non-spatial information that differentiated the overlapping routes (e.g., pedestrians, cars, etc.). While we cannot determine the precise nature of hippocampal representations in the present study, it is clear that hippocampal representations were very distinct from representations in PPA-a cortical region adjacent to the hippocampus that has been implicated in coding spatial landmarks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">49</xref></sup>. Indeed, PPA and the hippocampus exhibited opposite representational structures at the end of learning: in PPA, overlapping routes were more similar than non-overlapping routes, whereas in the hippocampus this representational structure was reversed. Thus, while the hippocampus may be part of a broader network of regions involved in spatial navigation and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50" hwp:id="xref-ref-50-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51" hwp:id="xref-ref-51-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-51">51</xref></sup> our findings highlight unique representational dynamics within the hippocampus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-7"><title hwp:id="title-12">METHODS</title><sec id="s4a" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-13"><italic toggle="yes">Subjects</italic></title><p hwp:id="p-30">New York University (NYU) students and alumni who were familiar with the NYU campus participated in the study.

Each route was comprised of a series of 98 unique pictures. All pictures were taken at regular intervals (every 10 paces) from an egocentric perspective by a researcher walking along the route. All routes started in the same location and made exactly three turns before ending at distinct destinations. Critically, the 8 routes consisted of 4 overlapping pairs. Overlapping pairs followed the same path for the majority of the route before diverging on the third turn to their respective destinations. The pictures for each route were taken at different times and therefore the pictures during the overlapping portion of routes were subtly different and could be distinguished from one another based on subtle differences in the pedestrians, vehicles, lighting, etc.For analysis purposes, routes were divided into pairs that shared an overlapping path (‘overlapping routes’; e.g. routes 1 and 2) or took distinct paths (‘nonoverlapping routes’; e.g. routes 1 and 3). Furthermore, each route was divided into two segments: ‘Segment 1’ refers to the segment of each route that overlapped with another route and ‘Segment 2’ refers to the route-unique segment of each route. The third turn-which marked the boundary between Segments 1 and 2-occurred at the exact same picture numbers within pairs or overlapping routes (e.g., for routes 1 and 2) and varied minimally (between picture numbers 74-77) across sets of overlapping pairs (e.g., for routes 1/2 vs. routes 3/4). Likewise, all turns within a pair of overlapping routes occurred at identical time points in order to maximize the similarity of overlapping routes. There was exactly one overlapping pair that left the starting point in each cardinal direction (north, south, east, west). The 8 routes were divided into 2 sets (north/south routes and east/west routes). Each subject was assigned one set of routes (4 routes total) to learn, with the assignment of route sets alternating subject-by-subject. We included 2 sets of routes in order to ensure our results could not be explained by the idiosyncrasies of any one route.</p><p hwp:id="p-32">A new set of 8 routes was used in fMRI Experiment 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-8" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The routes were constructed using the same parameters as the routes used in the behavioral and first fMRI experiments, with one key difference. Instead of all routes terminating at distinct locations, fMRI Experiment 2 contained pairs of routes that took distinct paths but ended at the same destination. As before, the 8 routes were divided into two sets of 4 and each set of 4 contained two pairs of overlapping routes. The routes in each set could be divided into pairs that (a) shared an overlapping path but terminated at distinct destinations (‘overlapping routes’; e.g. routes 1 and 2), (b) had non-overlapping paths and terminated at distinct destinations (‘non-overlapping routes’; e.g. routes 1 and 4) or (c) had nonoverlapping paths but terminated at the same destinations (‘same destination’; e.g. routes 1 and 3).

Importantly, subjects were not told the destination of the route prior to the trial. Rather, the destination was only revealed at the end of the route, with the final picture (the destination) presented for 1690 ms. The destination’s name was also displayed above the final picture. Each route learning trial lasted a total of 24s and was followed by a 1-s inter-trial interval (ITI) during which a fixation cross was presented. Each round also contained two ‘catch’ trials to ensure subjects’ vigilance but were excluded from all analyses. For each catch trial, a route began as with a normal trial but the presentation stopped at a pre-selected picture number. A cue then appeared above the picture either instructing participants to identify (1) the routes’ final destination (destination test) or (2) the direction of the next turn (direction test). During the 3s response period the picture and test cue remained on screen with the four destination labels (destination test) or left/right labels (direction test) printed below the picture and participants selected their response using a keyboard. Catch trials stopped on pictures presented between 3-15s after the trial onset and at intervals of 1.5 s (to coincide with the TR length in the fMRI experiments; see fMRI Acquisition). The combined duration of the two test trials within each round were constrained to equal the duration of a full route learning trial (24 seconds). Although each subject completed an equal number of destination and direction catch trials throughout the experiment, and each route was tested an equal number of times, the assignment of catch trial type to both route number and round was randomized so as not to be predictable. That is, within a given round there could be 2 destination catch trials, 2 direction catch trials, or 1 of each, and a given route could be tested twice via a destination catch trial, twice as a direction catch trial, or once as each test.</p></sec><sec id="s4c1b" hwp:id="sec-13"><title hwp:id="title-18"><italic toggle="yes">Inter-Round Picture Test</italic></title><p hwp:id="p-35">At the end of each of the 14 route learning rounds, subjects were shown 20 static pictures, one at a time, drawn from the routes (5 per route in random order) and for each picture subjects were asked to select the corresponding destination from a set of four label options.

To ensure that the five pictures tested from each route in each test round were evenly sampled across positions in the route, each route’s 95 pictures (excluding the last 3 pictures that contained visuals of the destination) were divided into 5 time-bins of 19 pictures. For each inter-round picture test, one picture from each time-bin, from each route, was randomly selected to be tested with the constraint that a given picture was only tested once throughout the experiment.

Consistent with all prior implementations of the P-CIT toolbox <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">34</xref></sup>, we then aggregated data across subjects (i.e., 41 subjects x 60 voxel bins = 2,460 data points) and the P-CIT algorithm was applied to these aggregated data.</p><p hwp:id="p-50">The P-CIT algorithm approximates the posterior distribution over possible plasticity curves (i.e which curves are most probable given the data). As a first step, the algorithm rescales the predictor variable (here, 1st half timecourse similarity values) to fit within a range of 0 to 1. Next, the algorithm defines a parameterized family of curves (piecewise-linear curves with three segments) and then randomly samples 50,000 curves from this parameterized space in which the bounds of the x-axis extend from 0 to 1 and the bounds on the y-axis extend from -1 to 1. For each sampled curve the algorithm assigns an importance weight indicating how well the curve’s shape fit the observed data. After assigning importance weights to all 50,000 samples, the algorithm regenerates a new set of sample curves by taking the highest weighted curves from the previous sample and slightly distorting them. This process of assigning importance weights to sampled curves and resampling curves based on those importance weights was repeated for 20 iterations. The resultant collection of weighted samples can be interpreted as an approximate posterior probability distribution over curves. In other words, curve samples with high importance weights are relatively probable given the data whereas sample curves with low importance weights are relatively improbable. The algorithm then estimates a curve by averaging the sampled curves together weighted by their importance values. Credible intervals were computed by finding the range of y values contained within the middle 90% of the curve probability mass at each interval along the x-axis. To summarize the level of evidence in favor of the nonmonotonic plasticity hypothesis the algorithm computes the log Bayes factor that reflects the log of the ratio of evidence in favor of the hypothesis to the evidence against the hypothesis. To compute the log Bayes factor, first each curve in the final set of samples was labeled as either theory consistent (i.e. if moving from left to right the curve dropped below its starting point and then rose above its starting value) or theory inconsistent. Then, the proportion of the posterior probability distribution mass taken up by theory-consistent samples was computed by summing together the weights corresponding to theory consistent curves and dividing that value by the sum of the weights corresponding to theory-inconsistent curves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref></sup>. The log Bayes factor was then computed as:

</disp-formula></p><p hwp:id="p-51">The correction factor compensates for the fact that only 33.28% of the space of possible curves is comprised of theory consistent curves. Without this adjustment we would expect a large imbalance in favor theory-inconsistency due to chance. To test whether the obtained log Bayes factor value could have arisen due to chance, we ran a non-parametric permutation test. Specifically, we re-ran the algorithm 500 times with the 1st and 2nd half timecourse similarity values shuffled within subject yielding an empirical null distribution over log Bayes factor values. We then measured where our observed log Bayes factor value fell on this distribution to compute the probability of obtaining this value under the null hypothesis. Lastly, the P-CIT toolbox also calculates a chi-squared likelihood ratio test that assesses how well the estimated curve explains the data. The <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value for this test indicates the probability of obtaining the observed predictive accuracy relative to a null model in which there is no relationship between timecourse similarity values across halves.</p><p hwp:id="p-52"><italic toggle="yes">Statistics:</italic> For all behavioral and fMRI analyses (with the exception of the curve-fitting procedures) we used standard random-effects statistics (paired sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests and repeated measures ANOVA).

Subjects were instructed to select the destination name corresponding to the route picture. In Experiment 1, each trial had 4 destination options corresponding to the target destination, the overlapping route destination (‘competitor’) and the two non-overlapping route destinations (‘other’).

Analyses were restricted to pictures drawn from Segment 1 of each route (i.e., the segments that contained overlap) in order to test discrimination of the overlapping routes.

There was also no learning-related changes in overlapping route similarity relative to same route similarity (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,39</sub> = 0.18, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.67). Overlapping route similarity did not differ from same route similarity in either the 1<sup>st</sup> half (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,39</sub> = 1.41, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.24) or 2<sup>nd</sup> half of learning (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,39</sub> = 1.91, P = 0.18). For comparison, data from the hippocampus are shown here (identical to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-10" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The difference in representational structure across hippocampus and RSC was confirmed by a significant interaction between overlap (overlapping vs. non-overlapping) and region (hippocampus vs. RSC) within the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of learning (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,39</sub> = 10.23, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0027). Thus, although RSC patterns did change with learning, the end states of learning were qualitatively different across hippocampus and RSC.

In Experiment 2, non-overlapping routes included pairs of routes that terminated at distinct destinations as well as pairs that terminated at the same destination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-10" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). To test whether hippocampal activity patterns reflected navigational goals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-9" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup> we compared Segment 1 spatiotemporal pattern similarity in the hippocampus across these two non-overlapping route conditions. If pattern similarity in the hippocampus reflects predicted destinations, then pattern similarity should be higher in the same destination condition than in the distinct destination condition. This difference in pattern similarity (same destination &gt; distinct destination) would also be expected to increase over the course of learning as predictions improved. (<bold>a</bold>) Within Segment 1, there was no evidence for a learning-related change in similarity in the same destination condition relative to the distinct destination condition (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,20</sub> = 0.53, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.47). When considering the 2<sup>nd</sup> half data alone, there was no difference in similarity between the same and distinct destination conditions (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>20 = 0.98, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.34). These data indicate that spatiotemporal activity patterns elicited during Segment 1 did not reflect predicted destinations or navigational goals. (<bold>b</bold>) To test whether destination coding might occur at discrete time points within the route (e.g., at the beginning of each route) we compared the similarity between same destination and distinct destination on a TR-by-TR basis (using spatial pattern similarity). Data were separated by learning half (columns) and stimulus groups (rows). Data were divided by stimulus group because turns occurred at slightly different time points (TRs) across the stimulus groups. Pattern similarity did not significantly differ between the same and distinct route conditions at any time point across halves or stimulus groups (Ps &gt; 0.05).
