Those biases, though often subtle, are pervasive in several ways: they are often held and perpetuated by both men and women, and they are apparent across all aspects of academic and scientific practice. Undergraduate students show bias in favor of men both when rating their peers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref></sup> and their professors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup>. Professors, in turn, are more likely to respond to e-mail from prospective students who are male<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref></sup>. They also show gender bias when hiring staff and deciding on a starting salary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">When looking at research output in the form of publication and impact, the story is complex: Women tend to publish less than men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup>, are underrepresented in the more prestigious first and last author positions, and publish fewer single-author papers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup>. Articles authored by women are cited less frequently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup>, which might in part be due to men citing their own work more often than women do<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>. Inferring bias in these studies is difficult, since the cause of the disparity between male and female authorship cannot be readily determined. At the same time, when stories of scientific discoveries are told, gender biases are readily identified: Work by female scientists is more likely to be attributed to a male colleague<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref></sup>, and biographies of successful female scientists perpetuate gender stereotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref></sup>. Finally, the way in which evidence for gender bias is received is in itself biased: Male scientists are less likely to accept studies that point to the existence of gender bias than are their female colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Although gender imbalance seems to be universal across all aspects of the scientific enterprise, there are also more nuanced effects. In particular, not all disciplines are equally affected. For instance, in the biosciences over half of PhD recipients are now women, while in computer science, it is less than 20%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref></sup>. This raises an intriguing question, namely how do the effects of gender persist in interdisciplinary fields where the parent fields are discordant for female representation?</p><p hwp:id="p-6">To this end, we are interested in the gender balance in computational biology and how it compares to other areas of biology, since computational biology is a relatively young field at the disciplinary intersection between biology and computer science. We examined authorship on publications from Pubmed published between 1997 and 2014 and compared computational biology to biology in general. We found that in computational biology, there are fewer female authors overall, and fewer female authors in first and last authorship positions than in all biological fields combined. This is true across all years, though the gender gap has been narrowing, both in computational biology and in biology overall. A comparison to computer science papers shows that computational biology stands between biology and computer science in terms of gender equality.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">Results and Discussion</title><p hwp:id="p-7">In order to determine if there is a difference in the gender of authors in computational biology compared to biology as a whole, we used data from Pubmed, a database of biology and biomedical publications administered by the US National Library of Medicine. Pubmed uses Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms to classify individual papers by subject. The MeSH term “Computational Biology” is a subset of “Biology” and was introduced in 1997, so we restricted our analysis to primary articles published after this date (see Supplementary Figure 1A-B, Materials and Methods).</p><p hwp:id="p-8">To determine the gender of authors, we used the web service Gender-API.com, which curates a database of first names and associated genders from government records as well as social media profiles. Gender-API searches provide information on the likely gender as well as confidence in the estimate based on the number of times a name appears in the database. We used bootstrap analysis to estimate the probability (P<sub>female</sub>) that an author in a particular dataset is female as well as a 95% confidence interval (see Materials and Methods)</p><p hwp:id="p-9">We validated this method by comparing it to a set of 2155 known author:gender pairs from the biomedical literature provided by Filardo et. al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup> Filardo and colleagues manually determined the genders of the first authors for over 3000 papers by searching for authors’ photographs on institutional web pages or social media profiles like LinkedIn. We used our computational inference of gender for a subset of this data, which suggested P<sub>female</sub> = 0.373, 95% CI = [0.350, 0.396], compared to the known gender, which gave P<sub>female</sub> = 0.360 (using the same bootstrap analysis, 95% CI = [0.342, 0.379]) (Supplementary Figure 1C). Because Gender-API does not have information for a subset of names (43% of unique names in our Biology dataset, representing 26.6% of authors), these names are excluded from our analysis. In order to ensure that this was not skewing our analysis, we also determined the P<sub>female</sub> in Filardo et al.'s known gender dataset excluding those authors, giving P<sub>female</sub> = 0.381, 95% CI = [.354, 0.409]. Together, these results suggest that our method of automatically assigning gender using Gender-API gives comparable result to hand-curated gender assignment, and that excluding names without clear gender information does not lead us to underestimate the proportion of women in our dataset.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">We began by analyzing the gender representation in primary publications from 1997 to 2014. Consistent with previous publications, women were substantially less likely to be in senior author positions than first author positions in publications labeled with the Biology (Bio) MeSH term (Last author, P<sub>female</sub> = 0.245, 95% CI = [0.243, 0.247], First author, P<sub>female</sub> = 0.376, 95% CI = [0.373, 0.378]).

We observed the same trend in papers labeled with the computational biology (comp) MeSH term, though the P<sub>female</sub> at every author position was 4-6 percentage points lower. An analysis of publications by year suggests that the gender gaps in both biology and computational biology are narrowing, but by less than 1 percentage point per year (for bio, ΔP<sub>female</sub> = 0.0035 / year, 95% CI = [0.0030, 0.0040]. For comp, ΔP<sub>female</sub> = 0.0049 / year, 95%CI = [0.0041, 0.0057]).

If true, we would expect studies with a female principal investigator to be more likely to attract female collaborators. Conventionally in biology, the last author on a publication is the principal investigator on the project. Therefore, we looked at two subsets of our data: publications with a female last author (P<sub>female</sub> &gt; 0.8) and those with a male last author (P<sub>female</sub> &lt; 0.2). We found that women were substantially more likely to be authors at every other position if the paper had a female last author than if the last author was male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-3" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-2-1" hwp:rel-id="T2">Table 2</xref>). It is possible that female trainees are be more likely to pursue computational biology if they have a mentor that is also female. Since women are less likely to be senior authors, this might reduce the proportion of women overall.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float" hwp:id="T2" hwp:rev-id="xref-table-wrap-2-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;070631v1/TBL2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">T2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">tbl2</object-id><graphic xlink:href="070631_tbl2" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-3"/></table-wrap><p hwp:id="p-15">Though MeSH terms enable sorting a large number of papers regardless of where they are published, the assignment of these terms is a manual process and may not be comprehensive for all publications. As another way to qualitatively examine gender differences in publishing, we examined different journals, since some journals specialize in computational papers, while others are more general. We looked at the 123 journals that had at least 1000 authors in our bio dataset, and determined P<sub>female</sub> for each journal separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Of these journals, 21 (14%) have titles indicative of computational biology or bioinformatics, and these journals have substantially lower representation of female authors. The 3 journals with the lowest female representation and 6 out of the bottom 10 are all journals focused on studies using computational methods. Only 4 computational biology/bioinformatics journals are above the median of female representation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F2" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-2-1 xref-fig-2-2"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;070631v1/FIG2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig2</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption hwp:id="caption-2"><p hwp:id="p-16">(A) Mean probability that an author is female for every journal that had at least 1000 authors in our dataset.

We therefore compared the P<sub>female</sub> of authors in each journal with that journal's 2014 impact factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-2" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). There is a marginal but significant (p = 0.0025) negative correlation between impact factor and gender for the biology dataset (r<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup> = 0.06, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.0078]), consistent with previous studies. By contrast, there is no significant correlation between impact factor and P<sub>female</sub> in computational biology publications. Further, for journals that have articles labeled with the computational biology MeSH term, the P<sub>female</sub> for those articles is the same or lower than that for all biology publications in the same journal.</p><p hwp:id="p-19">Taken together, these data suggest that the authors of computational biology papers are less likely to be women than the authors of biology papers generally. However, since Pubmed does not index computer science publications, we cannot compare computational biology to computer science. Instead, we turned to data from arXiv, a preprint repository for academic papers used frequently by quantitative fields like mathematics and physics. These preprint records cannot be directly compared to peer-reviewed publications indexed on pubmed, but a “quantitative biology” section was added to arXiv in 2003. There are relatively few papers preprints prior to 2007, so we compared preprints in “quantitative biology” to those in “computer science” from 2007-2016.</p><p hwp:id="p-20">Women were more likely to be authors in quantitative biology than in computer science in first, second, and middle author positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-1" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-3-1" hwp:rel-id="T3">Table 3</xref>), though the conventions for determining author order are not necessarily the same in computer science.

This is perhaps not surprising given the interdisciplinary nature of computational biology. Compared to biology in general, computational biology papers have fewer female authors, and this is consistent across all authorship positions. Importantly, this difference is not due to a difference in impact factor between computational biology and general biology papers.</p><p hwp:id="p-24">Articles with a female last author tend to have more female authors in other positions and this is true for both biology in general and computational biology. Since the last author position is most often occupied by the principal investigator of the study, this suggests that having a woman as principal investigator has a positive influence on the participation of women. This could be because female PIs are more likely to recognise contributions by female staff members, or because they are more likely to attract female co-workers and collaborators. The publication data cannot differentiate between those two (and other) explanations, but points to the important role that women in senior positions may play as role models for trainees.</p><p hwp:id="p-25">Since biology attracts more women than computer science, we suspect that many women initially decide to study biology and later become interested in computational biology. If this is the case, understanding what factors influence the field of study will provide useful insight when designing interventions to help narrow the gender gap in computer science and computational biology.</p></sec><sec id="s3" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-5">Datasets</title><sec id="s3a1" hwp:id="sec-5"><title hwp:id="title-6">Biology pubs 1997-2014 (bio)</title><p hwp:id="p-26">This dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup> contains all English language publications under the MeSH term “Biology” published between 1997 and 2014, excluding many non-primary sources.
