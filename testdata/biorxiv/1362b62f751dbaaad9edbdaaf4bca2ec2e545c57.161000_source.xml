It is also an early biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease that precedes detectable memory loss. Clinical tests that evaluate the sense of smell face two major challenges. First, human sensitivity to individual odorants varies significantly, leading to potential misdiagnosis of people with an otherwise normal sense of smell but insensitivity to the test odorant. Second, prior familiarity with odor stimuli can bias smell test performance. We have developed new non- semantic tests for olfactory sensitivity (SMELL-S) and olfactory resolution (SMELL-R) that overcome these challenges by using mixtures of odorants that have unfamiliar smells. The tests can be self-administered with minimal training and showed high test-retest reliability. Because SMELL-S uses odor mixtures rather than a single molecule, odor-specific insensitivity is averaged out. Indeed, SMELL-S accurately distinguished people with normal and dysfunctional smell. SMELL-R is a discrimination test in which the difference between two stimulus mixtures can be altered stepwise. This is an advance over current discrimination tests, which ask subjects to discriminate monomolecular odorants whose difference cannot be objectively calculated. SMELL-R showed significantly less bias in scores between North American and Taiwanese subjects than conventional semantically-based smell tests that need to be adapted and translated to different populations. We predict that SMELL-S and SMELL-R will be broadly effective in diagnosing smell dysfunction, including that associated with the earliest signs of memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease.</p><sec hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Significance statement</title><p hwp:id="p-3">Currently available smell testing methods can misdiagnose subjects with lack of prior experience or insensitivity to the odorants used in the test. This introduces a source of bias into clinical tests aimed at detecting patients with olfactory dysfunction. We have developed smell tests that use mixtures of 30 molecules that average out the variability in sensitivity to individual molecules. Because these mixtures have unfamiliar odors, and the tests are non-semantic, their use eliminates differences in test performance due to the familiarity with the smells or the words used to describe them. The SMELL-S and SMELL-R tests facilitate smell testing of diverse populations, without the need to adapt the test stimuli.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-3">Keywords</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">olfaction</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">smell test</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">olfactory sensitivity</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">olfactory resolution</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">olfactory dysfunction</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-6">odor-specific insensitivity</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-7">hyposmia</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-8">anosmia</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-9">SMELL-S test</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-10">SMELL-R test</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-11">UPSIT</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-12">Sniffin’ Sticks</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-4">Introduction</title><p hwp:id="p-4">Smell dysfunction manifests itself primarily in the reduced ability to detect or identify volatile chemicals, and ranges from the complete inability to smell any odors, to a partial reduction in olfactory sensitivity, to smell distortion, for instance that a large number of odors smell like cigarette smoke. The prevalence of smell dysfunction in the general adult population is about 20% in Europe and the United States (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>–<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>). This condition is dangerous because those affected are unable to detect fire, spoiled food, hazardous chemicals, and leaks of odorized natural gas (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>, <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>). Smell loss also has severe health consequences, including mental health symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and social isolation. It affects quality of life by altering food preferences and the amount of food ingested (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>). Food is often perceived as bland or tasteless by patients with smell disorders, leading to loss of appetite or overeating (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>, <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Smell dysfunction has many causes, including head trauma, upper respiratory tract infection, nasal polyps, and congenital anomalies (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>, <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>). In many cases, the cause of smell dysfunction is unknown (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>, <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>). Importantly, smell dysfunction is an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>), the most common cause of dementia in the United States that is projected to affect an estimated 1 in every 45 individuals by 2050 (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>). There is growing evidence that diminished olfactory function arises early in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, and is highly predictive of future cognitive decline (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>, <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>). Because of the high prevalence and dramatic consequences of smell loss, accurate diagnosis of olfactory dysfunction is important. While self- reported hearing loss tends to be accurate (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>), self-reporting of olfactory dysfunction is notoriously unreliable. Therefore, accurate diagnostic tests for smell dysfunction that can be deployed worldwide are critically important. Following a diagnosis, therapeutic options and counselling can be offered to patients suffering from smell loss (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-6">In clinical smell testing, patients are presented with odor stimuli in a variety of formats, including scratch ‘n’ sniff strips, glass vials or jars, felt-tip pens, or paper scent strips used in perfume shops, and asked to answer questions about what they smell. Smell tests assess the ability of subjects to detect, discriminate, or identify odors. Olfactory threshold tests measure the lowest concentration of an odor stimulus that a patient can perceive, while discrimination tests assess the ability of subjects to distinguish two different smells. Finally, odor identification tests evaluate whether a patient can detect and match odors to standard words that describe the smell (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-7">There are two major challenges to reliably testing a patient’s sense of smell. First, sensitivity to monomolecular odorants varies greatly even among subjects with a normal sense of smell (14- 16). All commercial smell tests that use monomolecular odorants therefore run the danger of misdiagnosing patients. For instance, when a patient has a low score on a test that assesses olfactory sensitivity with the rose-like odor phenyl ethyl alcohol (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>), it is difficult to know whether the patient suffers from general smell dysfunction, or is merely insensitive to phenylethyl alcohol with an otherwise normal sense of smell.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">The second challenge is to develop a test that is not influenced by the patient’s prior olfactory experiences. This has an obvious influence on the results of odor identification tests such as the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) for which subjects are given a booklet with 40 scratch ‘n’ sniff items and asked to select one of four words (for example “gingerbread”, “menthol”, “apple”, or “cheddar cheese”) that best describes what the odor smells like. Whether a patient can correctly identify the smell of gingerbread depends not only on the patient’s sense of smell, but also on whether the patient has previously encountered the smell of gingerbread. This in turn depends on many factors such as the cultural and age group the patient belongs to. To address this familiarity problem, the UPSIT has been adapted for use in a number of countries worldwide by replacing unfamiliar items and adapting the answers on the multiple-choice test. For instance, the North American UPSIT was adapted for Taiwanese subjects by replacing “clove”, “cheddar cheese”, “cinnamon”, “gingerbread”, “dill pickle”, “lime”, “wintergreen”, and “grass” with “sandalwood”, “fish”, “coffee”, “rubber tire”, “jasmine”, “grapefruit”, “magnolia”, and “baby powder” (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>). The strong influence of prior olfactory experience on the test results limits the utility of odor identification tests. Even performance on non-semantic odor discrimination tasks depends on prior experience with the odorants (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>, <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>), and it is therefore important to avoid stimuli having differential familiarity in the test population.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">We have developed two non-semantic smell tests that meet both challenges by using mixtures of odorous molecules that subjects perceive as unfamiliar. SMELL-S measures olfactory sensitivity, the ability to detect increasing dilution of the mixture of odorants. SMELL-R is an olfactory resolution test that measures the ability of subjects to discriminate the smell of two mixtures that become progressively more similar as the test proceeds. Neither of the tests requires that subjects match words with a smell percept. We show that SMELL-S and SMELL-R are highly reliable olfactory tests that overcome problems with odor- specific insensitivity, and that can be applied without adaptation to subjects in a different country. We expect that these tests, applied in combination, will be highly effective for early diagnosis of smell dysfunction in different populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-5">Results</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-6">Designing two new smell tests: SMELL-S and SMELL-R</title><p hwp:id="p-10">To improve currently available diagnostic tools for testing olfactory function, we created two new smell tests based on odorant mixtures.

There was a strong correlation between the phenylethyl alcohol threshold self-administered in glass vials and Sniffin’ Sticks administered by a research assistant (r=0.87; 95% confidence interval: 0.72 - 0.95, Pearson correlation).

The variability in test scores across all subjects in Experiment 1 of the phenylethyl alcohol threshold was significantly higher than that of SMELL-S (v1) and SMELL-S (v2) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-1" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. <italic toggle="yes">3A</italic></xref>).

The low phenylethyl alcohol scores of the other 6 subjects likely reflect odor-specific insensitivity to odorant rather than impaired olfactory function. These subjects would have been misdiagnosed with smell dysfunction using the phenylethyl alcohol threshold test.</p><p hwp:id="p-19">To confirm this, we compared the SMELL-S test with the Sniffin’ Sticks phenylethyl alcohol threshold test and the North American version of the UPSIT (Experiment 2; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-2" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. <italic toggle="yes">3B</italic></xref>). Since SMELL-S (v2) had the narrowest 95% limits of agreement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-6" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. <italic toggle="yes">2B</italic></xref>), we used this version of SMELL-S for the rest of this study. In Experiment 2, we assessed the performance of subjects with a self-reported normal or abnormal sense of smell on the UPSIT, Sniffin’ Sticks, and SMELL-S (v2). Based on results in Figure <italic toggle="yes">3A</italic>, we anticipated that SMELL-S (v2) would be more accurate than the Sniffin’ Sticks phenylethyl alcohol threshold test in identifying subjects with smell dysfunction. We used the UPSIT to benchmark the performance of the Sniffin’ Sticks phenylethyl alcohol threshold test compared to SMELL-S (v2). Because this smell test is composed of 40 different items, the final score is not strongly affected by odor-specific insensitivity to any given stimulus among the 40 items of the test. To set a cut-off between normal and dysfunctional subjects, we performed a literature search on mean UPSIT scores in North American patients suffering from smell dysfunction caused by various etiologies. Based on this analysis and consistent with an earlier study (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>), we defined normal olfactory function as an UPSIT score of 29 and over and smell dysfunction as an UPSIT score of 28 and lower (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. <italic toggle="yes">3C</italic></xref>). In Experiment 2, the mean score of the subjects with self-reported smell dysfunction was below this cut-off, whereas the mean score of those with self-reported normal sense of smell was above the cut-off (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-4" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. <italic toggle="yes">3C</italic></xref>).

Even so, several items were frequently mistaken by North American subjects, including “paint thinner” when the correct answer was “cheddar cheese”, “musk” instead of “lime”, and “wintergreen” instead of “bubble gum”. The Taiwanese subjects also struggled with the “cheddar cheese” item, also frequently mistaking it for “paint thinner”, but in addition mistook “turpentine” for “soap”, “motor oil” for “grass”, and “clove” for “licorice”. The overall UPSIT scores for Taiwanese subjects were significantly lower than those of the North American subjects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-3" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. <italic toggle="yes">5C</italic></xref>) (p&lt;0.0001, Mann Whitney test).

Auditory and visual stimuli used in the clinic differ by tone frequency or letter size, leading to quantitative and standardized diagnostic tests such as the audiogram and the eye chart. In olfaction, it is more complicated to quantify similarity between olfactory stimuli. Currently available discrimination tests consist of several pairs of odorants that must be discriminated by the patient. There currently is no method to quantify how difficult the individual discrimination tests are. Is distinguishing “rose” from “leather” more or less difficult than discriminating “pineapple” from “licorice”? To overcome this problem, we used a physical scale based on the number of shared components between two mixtures. The more components two mixtures share, the more difficult it is to discriminate them (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>, <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>). By using this physical scale, we reliably determined the resolution of the olfactory system.</p><p hwp:id="p-31">A third objective was to develop smell tests that utilize stimuli that have not been previously encountered by patients to minimize the influence of prior olfactory experience on the test results (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>, <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>). We accomplished this by using mixtures of 30 different molecules. These exact mixtures are very unlikely to be encountered outside the laboratory. Furthermore, before mixing them, the chemicals were diluted so that they had approximately equal intensity to ensure that the percept of the mixture is not dominated by a single odorant. The resulting smell of such mixtures has been described as olfactory white (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>). Using these stimuli is an improvement over the use of odorants that can be readily linked to their usual source, but only by those who have prior experience with it (18, 31, 32).</p><p hwp:id="p-32">Developing an olfactory test to reliably diagnose smell dysfunction is of great clinical importance not only because of the negative effects of smell dysfunction on quality of life, but because olfactory dysfunction may be an effective biomarker for predicting Alzheimer’s disease (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>). Piriform and entorhinal cortex, brain regions affected in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>–<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref>), are also involved in the processing of olfactory information. Consistent with this anatomical observation, Alzheimer’s disease patients show both reduced sensitivity to test odorants and a reduced ability to match specific odorants with words describing them (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">36</xref>). We suggest that the non-semantic SMELL-R and SMELL-S test will be an effective and non- invasive method to identify Alzheimer’s disease in patients before the earliest symptoms of memory loss are detected.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="COI-statement" hwp:id="sec-10"><title hwp:id="title-17">Conflict of Interest</title><p hwp:id="p-33">J.W.H, A.K, and L.B.V. are inventors on U.S. provisional patent application 62/528,420, filed 3 July 2017, by The Rockefeller University, relating to the smell test methods in this manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-18">Acknowledgements</title><p hwp:id="p-34">We thank our research volunteers for their time and interest in the study and the staff of The Rockefeller University Hospital Outpatient Clinic for invaluable support.

North American subjects were recruited by The Rockefeller University Clinical Research Recruitment and Outreach Support Service (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref>). Taiwanese subjects were recruited by the nursing staff of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the Taichung Veterans General Hospital (Taiwan). All subjects gave their written informed consent to participate in these experiments, and were compensated for their time. All North American and Taiwanese subjects were able to understand and follow instructions in English or Mandarin, respectively. Subjects were aged 18 or over and agreed to refrain from using perfume or cologne, and ingesting anything except water one hour prior to the study visit. At the beginning of each visit, subjects washed their hands with odorless soap. For subjects reporting a normal sense of smell and taste, we excluded subjects who presented with current or past history of conditions that might be related to smell loss (acute or chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal tumor, upper respiratory tract infection or head trauma that altered the sense of smell for more than one month, history of brain or sinonasal surgery, asthma, stroke, neurodegenerative disease, radiation therapy or chemotherapy, active smoking, or consumption of medication affecting the sense of smell during the study).

The testing station comprised a computer, wireless mouse, barcode scanner, and trays containing numbered stimulus containers labeled with bar codes. Triangle tests were set up so that subjects were never tested with the same set of stimuli twice in a row, to avoid the situation where subjects remembered their answers from the previous trial. Subjects used a barcode scanner to register test data automatically. Subjects took between 20-35 minutes to complete each smell test, with the exception of the UPSIT which took 10-15 minutes. A standard inter-trial interval was imposed to avoid odor adaptation by requiring subjects to play a computer game for 20 seconds.</p><p hwp:id="p-37">SMELL-S and SMELL-R were created with four different mixtures of 30 molecules drawn from a panel of 109 monomolecular, intensity-matched chemicals. These odorants were selected from stimuli utilized in previous psychophysical studies (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>, <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">38</xref>). We used only molecules that minimally activated the trigeminal system, because such stimuli can be detected by anosmic subjects (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">39</xref>, <xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">40</xref>). A characteristic of trigeminal activation by a molecule is a fresh, cold, burning, eucalyptus, pungent, or tickling sensation. We used a lateralization task in which an odorant is applied into only one nostril to assign a lateralization score to each molecule. It is possible to localize the stimulated nostril if it activates the trigeminal system. In contrast, it is much harder to localize an olfactory stimulus (<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">41</xref>). Lateralization tasks were self-administered by one investigator. Two disposable squeeze bottles were placed in a device facilitating simultaneous squeezing and stimuli delivery in each nostril. Only one bottle was filled with an odor stimulus. The tip of each bottle was fitted with a foam piece that conformed to the investigator’s nostril, and placed at the entrance of each nostril. The investigator squeezed both bottles simultaneously and attempted to localize which nostril had received the stimulus. After each task, the device was spun on a rotating platform to randomize the odor-stimulus side. The final score corresponded to the number of correct tasks. There were a total of 20 tasks (<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">42</xref>). As a control experiment, we found that the lateralization score of the trigeminal stimulus eucalyptol (CID: 2758) at pure concentration was high (median, 20; interquartile range, 19.25 – 20; 4 trials). The lateralization score of the olfactory stimulus vanillin (CID: 1183) at pure concentration was low (median, 6.5; interquartile range, 5-12.5, 6 trials). The difference between the lateralization scores of eucalyptol and vanillin was statistically significant (p=0.0009, Mann-Whitney test). Each candidate for the mixtures was tested once. We included candidates with a score of 11 and below in the design of the mixtures (Supporting Data Set 1).</p><p hwp:id="p-38">To intensity-match molecules to be used in mixtures, odorants were diluted and three investigators individually classified them as too weak, well matched, or too strong. The concentration of “too weak” stimuli was increased and that of “too strong” stimuli decreased by a factor of 10. Weak components that could not be intensity-matched even at pure concentrations were excluded from the pool of odorants. We repeated this process until most of the components fell into the optimal intensity range. For 18 components investigators could not reach a consensus about intensity, but these were nevertheless used in the mixtures (CID: 1068, 7969, 31244, 9589, 17898, 104721, 3314, 14491, 62144, 7583, 7983, 60999, 251531, 7799, 61151, 9609, 8118, 89440). With these components, we created four mixtures of 30 components. The SMELL-S (v1) mixture was used as the ODD odor in SMELL-R (v1), and the SMELL-S (v2) mixtures was used as the CONTROL odor in SMELL R (v2). The mixtures for SMELL-R (v1) CONTROL odor and SMELL-R (v2) ODD odor were unique to these tests.

Subjects were presented with three vials: two contained 1 ml solvent (paraffin oil) and one contained either phenylethyl alcohol or butanol diluted in solvent in a total volume of 1 ml. Tests comprised 16 different concentrations generated by serial dilutions (1:2) of either odorant in paraffin oil, with the starting concentrations at 0.0313% for phenylethyl alcohol (vial) and 0.25% for butanol (vial). The subject was prompted to sniff each vial and select the one with the strongest perceived odor using an adaptive staircase procedure commonly used in smell testing (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref>). If they were unable to detect any difference among the three vials, they were prompted to choose one at random. The procedure started at the lowest concentration. If they identified an incorrect vial, the second next higher concentration was presented and so on, until they identified the correct vial. If the subjects identified the correct vial, they were retested at the same concentration. If they identified the correct vial in this retest, they were tested at the next lower concentration. If they identified an incorrect vial, they were tested at the next higher concentration. A reversal is when the direction in which the concentration is changed reverses. The procedure ended after the seventh reversal, or until the subject failed the level with the highest concentration twice in row, or succeeded with the lowest concentration level 5 times in row. The threshold was defined as the average of the concentrations at which the last two reversals occurred. If the highest concentration were not correctly identified twice, the score was 1. If the lowest was identified 5 times in a row, the score was 16.</p></sec><sec id="s5d" hwp:id="sec-15"><title hwp:id="title-24">SMELL-S olfactory sensitivity test (v1 and v2)</title><p hwp:id="p-41">For SMELL-S (v1) and SMELL-S (v2), we prepared 19 serial dilutions in paraffin oil (1:2) of two different mixtures of 30 monomolecular odorants and used the last 16 dilutions, such that the tests ranged from easiest (level 1, 1:8 dilution) to most difficult (level 16, 1:262,144 dilution). Subjects were asked to sniff 3 vials, one of which was filled with 1 ml of a mixture of 30 components, and the other two were filled with 1 ml of solvent (paraffin oil). Subjects were instructed to pick out the one vial with the strongest perceived odor. If they were unable to detect any difference among the three vials, they were prompted to choose one at random. The procedure started at the lowest concentration (level 16). We calculated the SMELL-S sensitivity score following the same adaptive staircase procedure described above.

To create 16 levels of increasing overlapping components, we randomly progressively replaced components of a mixture of 30 molecules (we termed this the ODD odor), with components from another mixture of 30 components that did not change in composition across the levels (we termed this the CONTROL odor). Increasing the level of difficulty by one point correspond to an addition of 2 overlapping molecules between both mixtures, except from level 15 to 16, where we added only 1 shared molecule. Stimuli (8 ml) were introduced into jars containing absorbent cotton pads. Subjects were asked to sniff the contents of 3 jars, one of which was filled with 8 ml of a mixture of 30 components, and the other two were filled with 8 ml of a mixture of 30 components with different degree of overlap with the first jar. Subjects were instructed to pick out the odd jar. If they were unable to detect any difference among the three jars, they were prompted to choose one at random. Triangle tests started at a medium difficulty (level 8). If they identified the incorrect jar, the next easier level was presented.

On each page, there is a different scratch and sniff strip which is embedded with a microencapsulated odorant. There are also four choice multiple-choice questions on each page. Subjects used the tip of a pencil to release the smell of the stimuli. Subjects sniffed the odorant and selected the one word among the four options (for example “paint thinner”, “cherry”, “coconut”, or “cheddar cheese”) that most closely matched their perception of the smell. Subjects entered their answers to the 40 multiple-choice questions manually into a booklet, and investigators transferred the data manually into a spreadsheet.

Two subjects opted out of self-reporting race. Four subjects self-identified as Hispanic. We re-enrolled 23 subjects from Experiment 1 who self-reported a normal sense of smell and taste. These 23 were selected based on their threshold test results to have approximately even representation of subjects with low, medium, and high sensitivity to phenylethyl alcohol. In addition, we recruited 10 subjects with self-reported smell dysfunction. The self-reported etiologies are reported in Supporting Data Set 1.</p></sec><sec id="s5m" hwp:id="sec-24"><title hwp:id="title-33">Experiment 2, statistical analysis</title><p hwp:id="p-50">We performed a power analysis and determined that a study with 32 subjects (8 with smell loss and 24 with a normal sense of smell) guarantees 80% power at 5% significance to detect an area under the ROC curve greater than 0.78. Since our actual study included 33 subjects, we carried out a post hoc power analysis using the parameters above to show that we can detect an area under the ROC curve greater than 0.79. We employed Youden’s Index (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref>) to find the best cut-off score for SMELL- S and SMELL-R to maximize correct classification of the olfactory sensitivity and resolution of a subject, respectively (Fig. <italic toggle="yes">4C,F</italic>). We used two- sided unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction to test for differences between SMELL-S and SMELL-R score in normal and dysfunctional groups (Fig. <italic toggle="yes">4A,C</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s5n" hwp:id="sec-25"><title hwp:id="title-34">Experiment 3, design</title><p hwp:id="p-51">In this experiment, we investigated how SMELL-R performs on different populations by comparing Taiwanese (IRB TCVGH #CE16119B) and North American (Rockefeller University IRB Protocol #JHS-0901) subjects. The North American subjects were tested at The Rockefeller University Hospital, and the Taiwanese subjects were tested in the Department of Otolaryngology at Taichung Veterans General Hospital. The experimental design was the same in both institutions. Each subject came to the test site for a single visit, during which subjects performed the SMELL-R (v2) and UPSIT, separated by a 10 minute break, in randomized order (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-7" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. <italic toggle="yes">5A</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5o" hwp:id="sec-26"><title hwp:id="title-35">Experiment 3, subjects</title><p hwp:id="p-52">36 subjects were recruited at both sites.
