However, few methodologies were developed and systemic studies performed to identify novel drug candidates utilizing GWAS data. In this study we focus on drug repositioning, which is a cost-effective approach to shorten the developmental process of new therapies. We proposed a novel framework of drug repositioning by comparing GWAS-imputed transcriptome with drug expression profiles from the Connectivity Map. The approach was applied to 7 psychiatric disorders. We discovered a number of novel repositioning candidates, many of which are supported by preclinical or clinical evidence. We found that the predicted drugs are significantly enriched for known psychiatric medications, or therapies considered in clinical trials. For example, drugs repurposed for schizophrenia are strongly enriched for antipsychotics (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 4.69E-06), while those repurposed for bipolar disorder are enriched for antipsychotics (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 2.26E-07) and antidepressants (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 1.17E-05). These findings provide support to the usefulness of GWAS signals in guiding drug discoveries and the validity of our approach in drug repositioning. We also present manually curated lists of top repositioning candidates for each disorder, which we believe will serve as a useful resource for researchers.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="33"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">INTRODUCTION</title><p hwp:id="p-3">The last decade has witnessed a rapid growth of genotyping technologies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have played in major role in unraveling the genetic bases of complex diseases. According to the latest GWAS catalog (<ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/" hwp:id="ext-link-1">www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas</ext-link>. accessed 22<sup>nd</sup> Dec 2016), more than 2600 GWAS studies have been performed to date. It is worth noting that many biobanks are also collecting genomic data. and the private genetics company 23andMe has genotyped more than a million customers (<ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="http://mediacenter.23andme.com/fact-sheet/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mediacenter.23andme.com/fact-sheet/" hwp:id="ext-link-2">mediacenter.23andme.com/fact-sheet/</ext-link>). It is clearly of great clinical and public interest to translate these findings into treatment for diseases. Nevertheless, compared to the large literature of GWAS studies, relatively few methodologies have been developed and systematic studies performed to identify novel drug candidates by using GWAS data.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">Psychiatric disorders carry significant burden on health globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref></sup> and the current treatment strategies are far from perfect. Despite the heavy health burden and the increased awareness of mental health in many places, drug discovery in the field have largely been stagnant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup>. As argued by Hyman, the basic mechanisms of most antidepressants and antipsychotics, the most widely used drugs used in psychiatry, are relatively similar to their prototypes imipramine and chlorpromazine discovered in the 1950s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup>. On the other hand, in recent years GWAS studies have greatly advanced our knowledge of the genetic bases of many psychiatric disorders. Taking advantage of these developments, we proposed a new framework for identifying drug candidates based on GWAS results, and applied the method to a variety of psychiatric disorders.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Here we focus on drug repositioning, that is, finding new indications for existing drugs. As conventional drug development is an expensive and lengthy process, repositioning serves as a useful strategy to hasten the development cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref></sup>. It is worth noting that while we use the term “drug repositioning” throughout this paper, the method is also applicable to any chemicals with known gene expression profiles.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">A few previous studies have investigated the use of GWAS data in drug repositioning. The most intuitive approach is to study whether the top genes identified in GWAS can serve as drug targets. Sanseau et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup> searched for top susceptibility genes (with <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 1e-7) from the GWAS catalog and matched the results against the drug targets listed in the Pharmaprojects database, a commercial resource with information on global drug pipelines. In addition, they proposed a repositioning approach by identifying “mismatches” between drug indications and the original GWAS traits. In another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup>, Cao et al. considered interacting partners of GWAS hits to discover new drug targets. Lencz and Malhotra<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup> compared schizophrenia GWAS results with drug target genes, and prioritized potential new drug targets for the disease. Another recent study investigated whether evidence from human genetic studies are useful to drug development in general. The authors found that the proportion of drugs with support from GWAS increased along the development pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">While the approach of finding overlap between top GWAS hits and known drug target genes is useful, it has a number of limitations. Firstly, many of the top GWAS genes may not be easily targeted by a drug. Cao and Moult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup> studied 856 drug target genes from DrugBank and found only 20 genes that were discovered in GWAS of the corresponding disease. While this number is likely to improve with increasing sample sizes, there will remain a number of GWAS hits which are not directly “druggable”. In addition, many of the GWAS top SNPs are within non-coding regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref></sup> and do not encode for a drug target protein. The above approach might also miss “multi-target” drugs, a paradigm that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. It is argued that as complex diseases (like most psychiatric disorders) involve the interplay of multiple genetic and environmental factors, they may be more easily managed bymodulating multiple instead of single targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref></sup>. Lastly, as previous studies mainly focused mainly on the most significant hits, they ignored the contribution of genetic variants with smaller effect sizes. As shown in polygenic score analyses of many complex traits, often variants achieving lower significance levels also contribute to disease risks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">With the aforementioned limitations in mind, we developed a new strategy for drug repositioning by imputing gene expression profile from GWAS summary statistics and comparing it with drug-induced expression changes. Analysis of the transcriptome of drugs versus diseases is an established approach for drug repositioning and has previously been successfully applied for complex diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup>. For example, by examining drugs in the Connectivity Map (Cmap)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup> which showed opposite patterns of expression to diseases, Sirota et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref></sup> derived candidates for repositioning and experimentally validated a prediction cimetidine for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. With a similar method, Dudley et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup> identified topiramate as a novel treatment for inflammatory bowel disease and validated it in an animal model. Other studies (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref></sup>) also showed potential of this approach in repositioning.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Built on this repositioning strategy, we proposed a new approach by using imputed transcriptome from GWAS instead of expression data from microarray or RNA-sequencing studies. This approach has several advantages. Firstly, patients from expression studies are often medicated. This is particularly relevant for studies in neuro-psychiatry, as brain tissues can only come from post-mortem samples of patients, who were often on psychiatric medications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref></sup>. History of medications might confound our results as our aim is to compare the expression patterns of disease and those of drugs. Imputed transcriptome on the other hand is not altered by medications or other environmental confounders. Secondly, current GWAS samples are usually orders of magnitude larger than expression studies (often 10<sup>4</sup> or more), and GWAS summary statistics are widely available. In addition, for many diseases such as psychiatric disorders, the tissues of interest are not easily accessible. On the other hand, as we shall explain below, expression profiles can be readily imputed for over 90 tissues from GWAS data using appropriate statistical models.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">METHODS</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">Imputation of expression profile from GWAS data</title><p hwp:id="p-10">Recently methods have been developed to impute expression from GWAS variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref></sup>. The main idea is to build a statistical model to predict expression levels from SNPs in a reference transcriptome dataset, and the prediction model can be applied to new genotype data. This approach estimates the component of gene expression that is contributed by (germline) genetic variations. The program PrediXcan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref></sup> was developed for this purpose based on models built from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref></sup> and the Depression Genes and Networks (DGN) cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref></sup>. As most individual genotype data are not publicly available due to privacy concerns, we applied a recently developed algorithm called MetaXcan which allows imputation of expression <italic toggle="yes">z</italic>-scores (i.e. z-statistic derived from comparing gene expression in cases versus controls) based on summary statistics alone. The method was shown to be in excellent concordance with predictions made from raw genotype data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref></sup>. Assuming that a set of SNPs (SNP<sub>1</sub>, SNP<sub>2</sub> …, SNP<sub><italic toggle="yes">k</italic></sub>) contribute to the expression of gene g, the following formula can be used to compute the expression <italic toggle="yes">z</italic>-scores for the gene:

The weights of SNPs <italic toggle="yes">w<sub>gi</sub></italic> were computed from reference datasets of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. We downloaded pre-computed weights derived from an elastic net prediction model with GTEx as the reference transcriptome dataset, provided by the authors of MetaXcan. It is worth noting that the above methodology is similar to another transcriptome imputation algorithm TWAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref></sup>, but a different prediction method (based on a mixed model) is employed in TWAS.

We proposed to compare the GWAS-imputed transcriptome profiles with those derived from drugs. We applied the methodology to 7 psychiatric disorders and identified a number of interesting candidates for repositioning, many of which are supported by animal studies or clinical trials. The drug-set enrichment analyses further lend support to the validity of our approach.</p><p hwp:id="p-42">There are a number of advantages of our repositioning framework. Firstly this approach is largely “hypothesis-free” in the manner that it does not assume any knowledge about known drug targets or drug-disease relationships. As a result the method may be able to find drugs of different mechanisms from the known treatments. This method may be particularly useful for diseases with few known treatments or if existing treatments are highly similar in their mechanisms. A related advantage is that it can be applied to any chemicals as long as the expression profile is available, such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) products with no known drug targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83" hwp:id="xref-ref-83-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-83">83</xref></sup>. As described before, another important advantage when compared to conventional connectivity mapping is that GWAS-imputed transcriptome is relatively immune to confounding by medication effects. With the availability of eQTL reference resources such as GTEx, imputation of expression profiles can be performed easily for close to a hundred tissues. In addition, only GWAS summary statistics are required as input for imputation, which obviates the difficulties in obtaining raw genotype data and makes the approach easily applicable to a wide variety of traits. The current method is also intuitive and computationally simple to implement. Moreover, we have considered all genetic variants instead of just the most significant hits in our repurposing pipeline. One alternative for inclusion of sub-threshold associations is to employ gene-set analysis to look for over-representation of genes acting as drug targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84" hwp:id="xref-ref-84-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-84">84</xref></sup>, but here we proposed a different novel approach that does not rely on knowledge of known drug targets and takes into account the direction of genetic associations.</p><p hwp:id="p-43">It is encouraging to observe that our repositioning results are in general supported by the drug-set enrichment analyses. In particular, antipsychotics, which are known to treat SCZ and BD, are also strongly enriched in the repositioning candidates of these two disorders. Similarly, antidepressant is an indicated treatment option of BD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">49</xref></sup>, which was also significantly enriched for this disorder. For MDD (using the PGC data) and anxiety disorders, while we did not observe enrichment in ATC or MEDI-HPS drug-sets, there was some evidence that our approach preferentially picked up drugs included in clinical trials. These results suggest that GWAS results contain useful information for drug discovery or repositioning, and is concordant with the conclusion of a previous study that drugs supported by human genomic data increase along the development pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-44">Interestingly, our analyses also revealed possible enrichment of antipsychotics for MDD, anxiety disorders and AD. Antipsychotics have long been used for treatment of depression, especially in the more severe cases with psychotic symptoms. A recent meta-analysis also demonstrated efficacy of a number of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive treatment in depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85" hwp:id="xref-ref-85-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-85">85</xref></sup>. Given the high co-morbidity of depression and anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86" hwp:id="xref-ref-86-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-86">86</xref></sup> and possibly shared pathophysiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87" hwp:id="xref-ref-87-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-87">87</xref></sup>, it is not unexpected that antipsychotics may be useful for anxiety as well. Anti-psychotics are not infrequently prescribed for anxiety disorders, although its safety and efficacy warrant further investigations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88" hwp:id="xref-ref-88-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-88">88</xref></sup>. In a similar vein, we observed that antidepressants and anti-anxiety agents were over-represented in the top drug lists of SCZ and AD (with nominally significance for AD). Psychotic and depressive symptoms are very commonly seen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89" hwp:id="xref-ref-89-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-89">89</xref></sup> in AD patients, hence the enrichment for antipsychotics and antidepressants are expected. Antidepressants have been tested in clinical trials for schizophrenia, especially for negative symptoms, although further studies are required in this area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90" hwp:id="xref-ref-90-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-90">90</xref></sup>. Our findings provide a genetic basis for the effectiveness of psychiatric drugs across diagnoses.</p><p hwp:id="p-45">We observed that for some of the psychiatric disorders there were no significant enrichment of known drug indications, or the enrichment came from another class of drugs. There are a few possible explanations. Firstly, the sample size may not be large enough to detect enrichment of known drugs. Among the eight datasets, the sample size of SCZ GWAS is the largest, reaching almost 80000. For the other traits, the sample sizes are mostly between 5000 to 20000. Limited sample sizes imply that some true associations are not detected and the imputed transcriptome is less accurate, which will affect the ability to find drugs with matched (reversed) expression profiles. For any high-throughput studies with limited sample sizes, it is possible for some signals (here known drug indications) to be “missed”, although other associations may be detected. An analogy is that earlier SCZ GWAS with smaller sample sizes did not detect the <italic toggle="yes">DRD2</italic> locus but revealed other loci such as <italic toggle="yes">ZNF804A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91" hwp:id="xref-ref-91-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-91">91</xref></sup></italic>. With accumulation of samples, the latest GWAS meta-analysis did confirm <italic toggle="yes">DRD2</italic> as a susceptibility gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref></sup>. Hence limited sample sizes may explain, for instance, the enrichment of antipsychotics for MDD but not antidepressants.</p><p hwp:id="p-46">Secondly, many psychiatric disorders are known to be heterogeneous. For MDD, anxiety disorders and AD, the prevalences are relatively high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92" hwp:id="xref-ref-92-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93" hwp:id="xref-ref-93-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-93">93</xref></sup> and there may be a wider range of heterogeneity in clinical manifestations and the underlying pathophysiologies. The heterogeneity impairs study power and implies that a specific drug or drug class may only be effective for a certain group of patients. Third, there are limited available treatment for some disorders, especially AD, AUT and ADHD, which makes the detection of these known drug indications difficult.</p><p hwp:id="p-47">In addition to the above, we observed that enrichment analyses were mostly negative for the MDD-CONVERGE dataset. One possible explanation is that as the GTEx dataset from which transcriptome imputation is based is not well-matched to the MDD-CONVERGE sample. The latter sample is composed of Chinese women, while the GTEx project includes only 1.0% Asians and 34.4% of females to date (<ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="http://www.gtexportal.org/home/tissueSummaryPage" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home/tissueSummaryPage" hwp:id="ext-link-7">http://www.gtexportal.org/home/tissueSummaryPage</ext-link>, accessed 22<sup>nd</sup> Dec 2016). While we expect overlap in the genetics of expression regulation, the imputation quality may be affected. Notwithstanding some negative results in the drug enrichment analyses, many of the top candidates for repositioning are suggested in preclinical or clinical studies, and are still worthy of further investigations.</p><p hwp:id="p-48">There are a few general limitations to our approach. It is worth noting that the GWAS-imputed transcriptome captures the genetically regulated part of expression, and expression changes due to other factors (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic> environmental risk factors) cannot be modelled. The method of comparing expressions is largely “hypothesis-free” as mentioned previously, however it may be improved by incorporating knowledge on drug targets or drug-disease relationships, if such information is available. The drug expression profiles were not measured in brain tissues in Cmap, although the original publication on Cmap showed that drugs on neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease or schizophrenia can still be reasonably modelled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup>. It should be emphasized that the best approach to verify the repositioning predictions should rest on careful and adequately-sized preclinical and clinical studies, and the current study does not provide confirmatory evidence for the repositioning candidates.</p><p hwp:id="p-49">In conclusion, we have developed a novel framework for drug repositioning by linking up GWAS and drug expression profiling and applied the methodology to 7 psychiatric disorders. Our analyses also provide support that the psychiatric GWAS signals are enriched for known drug indications. We also present a list of repositioning candidates for each disorder, which will we believe will serve as a useful resource for preclinical and clinical researchers to pursue further studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-24">Acknowledgements</title><p hwp:id="p-50">This study is partially supported by the Lo-Kwee Seong Biomedical Research Fund and a Direct Grant from the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
