Near complete orexin neurodegeneration depletes orexin-A from the cerebrospinal fluid and produces Na-1. The pathophysiology of Na-2 is less understood, but has been hypothesized to be due to less extensive loss of orexin neurotransmission. The <italic toggle="yes">orexin-tTA; TetO diphtheria toxin A</italic> mouse allows conditional control over the extent and timing of orexin neurodegeneration. To evaluate partial ablation of the orexin field as a model of Na-2, orexin-A positive cell counts and sleep/wake phenotypes (determined by piezoelectric monitoring) were correlated within individual mice after different protocols of diet-controlled neurodegeneration. Partial ablations that began during the first 8 days of study were 14% larger than partial ablations induced during the last 8 days of study, six weeks later and prior to sacrifice of all mice, suggesting orexin-A positive cell death continued despite the resumption of conditions intended to keep orexin neurons intact. Sleep/wake of mice with 71.0% orexin-A positive cell loss, initiated at the beginning of study, resembled that of orexin-intact controls more than mice with near complete neurodegeneration. Conversely, mice with 56.6% orexin-A positive cell loss, created at the end of study, had sleep/wake phenotypes that were similar to those of mice with near complete orexin-A positive cell loss. Collectively, these results suggest that compensatory wake-promotion develops in mice that have some critical portion of their orexinergic system remaining after partial ablation.</p><sec hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Statement of significance</title><p hwp:id="p-4">The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 2 is poorly understood but has been hypothesized to be due, at least in part, to degeneration of a smaller proportion of the orexin neuronal field than occurs in narcolepsy type 1. To evaluate a transgenic mouse model of narcolepsy type 2, we correlated the sleep/wake phenotypes of individual, male and female adult mice that received diet-induced conditional ablations of orexin neurons with their orexin cell counts. Using a translatable measure of narcolepsy sleepiness severity, we demonstrated that compensatory wake-promoting responses developed in mice concurrent with progressive orexin neurodegeneration. These results provide important details necessary for preclinical drug discovery for therapeutic areas characterized by orexin insufficiency, such as narcolepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-3">Keywords</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">hypocretin</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">mouse</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">narcolepsy</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">orexin</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-6">piezoelectric sleep monitoring</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-7">sleep</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="29"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

Narcolepsy type 2 (Na-2) is based on exclusion of Na-1 criteria, and its etiology is less understood than the pathology underlying narcolepsy with cataplexy. However, a limited postmortem study suggests Na-2 can be caused by 33% orexin cell loss vs. the ~90% loss observed in patients with Na-1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup> Levels of CSF orexin-A that are between normal and the Na-1 cutoff value have been associated with Na-2 in a subset of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup> Both types of narcolepsy are diagnosed, in part, by EDS that is determined by the inability of patients to sustain long periods of wakefulness during the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and to fall asleep with short latency on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT).</p><p hwp:id="p-6">Two transgenic mouse models have been created that recapitulate the orexin neurodegeneration and arousal state boundary dysregulation observed in Na-1.

Thus, orexin neurodegeneration can be induced by removal of doxycycline (DOX(−)). Withdrawal of dietary DOX (100 μg/g chow) for 1.5, 3.5, 7, 14 and 28 days followed by resumption of DOX has been shown to induce 36%, 64%, 86%, 95%, and 97% orexin cell loss, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup> Longitudinal study by the same research group on a different set of DTA mice on continual DOX(−) has shown fragmentation of wakefulness during the dark period at 1 week DOX(−) that progressively worsened over the next 3 weeks. During this time, cataplexy began at 2 weeks DOX(−) and increased in frequency over the next 5 weeks or more. Thus, conditional control of orexin neurodegeneration in DTA mice has been proposed to model either Na-1 or Na-2, depending on the extent of the ablation. However, to validate partial ablation of the orexin field as a model of Na-2, the precision of the DOX(−) timing to reliably induce a certain percentage of orexin cell loss that corresponds to a translatable phenotype of Na-2, all within the same animal, must be determined.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">Recently, a translational test of the ability to sustain long bouts of wakefulness has been developed for mice using piezoelectric monitoring of sleep/wake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup> The PiezoSleep narcolepsy screen measures the ratio of time spent in long (≥ 32 min) wake bouts to time spent in short (&lt; 8 min) sleep bouts to yield a “wake maintenance score.” Sleep/wake is sampled during the first half of the dark period, when sustained wakefulness predominates in wild type mice, to allow narcolepsy symptom severity to be assessed.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Here, orexin cell counts and sleep/wake phenotypes were correlated within individual DTA mice after partial ablation of the orexin neuronal field and sex differences were determined. The effectiveness of the Tet Off system to maintain intact orexin neurons after partial ablations induced by DOX(−) was evaluated.

In Study 2, brains from DTA mice (14 males and 11 females) all aged 15.1 ± 0.1 weeks (26.1 ± 0.9 g) were used. Mice were sacrificed with 0.1 mL Beuthanasia-D (Henry Schein, Dublin, OH) and transcardially perfused with 0.4 % paraformaldehyde. Brains were harvested, post fixed overnight, and shipped in phosphate buffered saline to NeuroScience Associates (Knoxville, TN), where all histology and cell counts on tissue from DTA and WT mice were performed.

The multi-brain blocks were freeze-sectioned at 35 μm with brains in the coronal plane from approximately -1.23 to - 1.91 relative to Bregma. Every 4<sup>th</sup> section was retained for the detection of orexin-A positive neurons. After blocking in normal donkey serum (5% in 0.3% triton in PBS), sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with goat anti-donkey orexin-A antibody (SC-8070, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) at 1:2000 dilution. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, sections were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with biotinylated donkey anti-goat (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) at 1:500 dilution in blocking solution.

The frequency, amplitude, and peak spectral energy of the signal were evaluated in 2 second increments over a tapered, 8 second window to automatically calculate a sleep/wake decision statistic by simple linear discriminant analysis. Sleep was classified if signals exhibited a periodicity with a consistent, low relative amplitude at a frequency in the typical breathing range (1-4 Hz). Wakefulness was associated with high amplitude signals with variable frequency and broad spectral energy. Signal features related to these properties were extracted and combined to obtain a decision statistic for each interval. Over time, the decision statistics per increment accumulated in a bimodal distribution, and the saddle point of the distribution was determined using an adaptive threshold for the classification of sleep and wake. Bouts of contiguous intervals of sleep or wake were defined to terminate when an interval, equal to the minimum bout length of 30 s, included less than 50% of the targeted state.

The DTA mice in transit for 48 h and maintained on DOX chow (200 μg/g chow) did not lose orexin-A positive neurons despite weight loss, and presumably reduced DOX chow consumption. Because DOX(−)2d during transit only induced 9-13% orexin-A positive cell loss, in Study 2, DTA mice were subjected to DOX(−) 8d to produce more substantial neurodegeneration. Partial ablations of the orexin field that were created during the first week of study (DOX(−)8d (RD)6wk group) were 14% larger than the partial ablations induced by the same duration of DOX(−) that occurred in the last week of study (DOX(+)6wk DOX(−)8d group), suggesting orexin cell death continued despite the resumption of DOX chow for 6 weeks. Despite these larger partial ablations (71.0% orexin-A positive cell loss), the wake-maintenance scores of mice in the DOX(−)8d (RD)6wk group resembled those of orexin-intact mice more than those of mice with near complete (≥ 97%) orexin-A positive neurodegeneration. Conversely, mice with smaller partial ablations (56.6% orexin-A positive cell loss) in the DOX(+)6wk DOX(−)8d group had lower wake-maintenance scores that resembled those of mice with near complete orexin-A positive cell loss.</p><p hwp:id="p-31">Collectively, these results suggest that compensatory wakefulness, perhaps through the histaminergic system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref></sup> develops over time in mice that have some critical portion of their orexinergic system remaining after partial ablation. These compensatory changes may occur mostly within the first three weeks, because sleep/wake phenotypes remained stable within individual mice between Study Weeks 4 and 7.</p><p hwp:id="p-32">An important factor relevant to the interpretation of the neurodegeneration results in the current study vs. previous work concerns the different concentrations of DOX chow employed. In Study 1, DOX(−)2d resulted in ~5x less orexin-A positive cell loss than anticipated based on the rate of neurodegeneration previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup> Doxycycline in the current study was provided at twice the concentration as was used previously for an estimated daily dose of 24 mg/kg. An approximately 10-fold lower daily dose of DOX, as supplied by DOX (10 μg/mL) in drinking water, has been recommended as the optimal concentration for manipulation of gene expression within 1-2 days using the TetO system due to the very slow kinetics of washout and reactivation of the transgene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref></sup> Although the pharmacokinetics of DOX used in the current study is unknown, the dose used was ~16-fold lower than the dose achieved with DOX (2 mg/mL), which has been shown to cause residual suppression of gene expression after 8 weeks washout.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref></sup> In the current study, the smaller than expected ablation sizes and the continued neurodegeneration that was observed for weeks past the resumption of DOX may be related to the slow clearance of the DOX (200 μg/g) diet.</p><p hwp:id="p-33">Orexin insufficiency to varying degrees, as measured through either CSF orexin-A levels or postmortem histology, has been associated with a variety of neurological conditions in addition to narcolepsy and expands the clinical relevance of the DTA mouse. Orexin cell loss of 27% in Huntington’s disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref></sup> 23-62% in Parkinson’s disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref></sup> and 69% in multiple system atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref></sup> has been demonstrated despite normal levels of CSF orexin-A in these patient populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref></sup> This discrepancy suggests that the residual orexin neurons compensate for reduced orexin connectivity with increased peptide release. Compensation has been observed in rats with hypothalamic orexin-B-saporin lesions; 73% orexin cell loss resulted in only 50% loss of CSF orexin-A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref></sup> If this relationship can be extrapolated to DTA mice, then it can be speculated in the current study that mice with partial ablations may have had CSF orexin-A levels that were 40-50% less than those in orexin-intact controls. DTA mice with ≥ 97% orexin neurodegeneration may have had ≥ 66% loss of CSF orexin-A. This level of remaining CSF orexin-A (~1/3 of orexin-intact controls) is very close to the cutoff value (30% of controls or 110 pg/mL) that is most predictive of narcolepsy with cataplexy in the human diagnostic test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup> Future research to test these relationships between orexin cell loss and CSF orexin-A levels, and thereby increase the translational value of the partially ablated DTA mouse, will require the development of a highly sensitive assay to detect orexin-A levels in small volume (10 μL) CSF samples from individual mice, as current assays require pooling samples to obtain 5x that volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref></sup></p><p hwp:id="p-34">Narcolepsy type 2 is a heterogeneous disease entity with uncertain pathophysiology that makes clinical diagnosis and animal modeling challenging. Diagnosis of Na-2 requires: EDS, a positive score on the MSLT (sleep latency ≤ 8 min, and ≥ 2 sleep onset REM periods), an absence of cataplexy, and differentiation from idiopathic hypersomnia by signs of REM sleep boundary dysregulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref></sup> The majority of patients with Na-2 have normal CSF orexin-A levels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup> but 8% of patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy were found to have intermediate CSF orexin-A levels that were above the Na-1 cutoff value and below the normal level of ≥ 200 pg/mL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">34</xref></sup> Seven out of 10 patients with intermediate CSF orexin-A levels were found to have atypical or no cataplexy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup> In patients with intermediary orexin-A levels, 18% developed cataplexy years after the original narcolepsy-without-cataplexy diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">34</xref></sup> These data, together with the intermediary number of orexin cells found postmortem from one patient with narcolepsy without cataplexy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup> support the hypothesis that at least some cases of Na-2 lie on a continuum between Na-1 and idiopathic hypersomnia. The current study offers the first steps toward development of a mouse model of Na-2 based on this hypothesis that partial disruption of orexinergic signaling results in pathological sleepiness associated with less severe narcolepsy. However, the current study is limited by the lack of cataplexy and REM sleep measurements. Cataplexy assessment would be necessary to fully differentiate whether the phenotypes observed in DTA mice with partial ablations of the orexin field translate as Na-1 or Na-2. REM sleep timing may further distinguish subtle differences between DTA mice with different sizes of partial ablations. Measuring cataplexy requires invasive, time-consuming, and expensive procedures, and as such, would be the next step after establishment of protocols for creating specific ablation sizes that are associated with the mouse equivalent of excessive daytime sleepiness.</p><p hwp:id="p-35">In conclusion, a sub narcoleptic phenotype was modeled in DTA mice to the extent that a range of wake-maintenance scores was found to be associated with different sizes and durations of orexin-A positive cell loss. The relationship between partial orexin neurodegeneration and sleep/wake phenotype depends on the dynamics of progressive orexin cell loss and the development of a compensatory wake response. Further work is recommended to titrate the DOX(−) RD protocol for the induction of stable 80-90% orexin neurodegeneration. This amount of orexin cell loss is predicted to distinguish partially ablated DTA mice from orexin-intact controls without permitting cataplexy. The establishment of a mouse model based on partial ablation of orexin neurons will be critical for efficacy tests of orexin modulator therapies for narcolepsy and other diseases characterized by orexin insufficiency.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-20">Acknowledgements</title><p hwp:id="p-36">This work was funded by Reset Therapeutics and supported in part by the Michael J.
