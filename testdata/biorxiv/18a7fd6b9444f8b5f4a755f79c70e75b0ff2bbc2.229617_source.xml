The judgment of recency (JOR) task measures temporal order judgments for the past by presenting pairs of probe stimuli; participants choose the probe that was presented more recently. We performed a short-term relative JOR task and introduced a novel judgment of imminence (JOI) task to study temporal order judgments for the future. In the JOR task, participants were presented with a sequence of stimuli and asked to choose which of two probe stimuli was presented closer to the present. In the JOI task, participants were trained on a probabilistic sequence. After training, the sequence was interrupted with probe stimuli. Participants were asked to choose which of two probe stimuli was expected to be presented closer to the present. Replicating prior work on JOR, we found that RT results supported a backward self-terminating search model operating on a temporally-organized representation of the past. We also showed that RT distributions are consistent with this model and that the temporally-organized representation is compressed. Critically, results for the JOI task probing expectations of the future were mirror-symmetric to results from memory, suggesting a forward self-terminating search model operating on a temporally-organized representation of the future.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="31"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

In episodic memory in particular, the ability to remember episodes from the past has been linked to the ability to simulate the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61" hwp:id="xref-ref-61-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-61">Tulving, 1985</xref>). Recent findings from neuroimaging studies have found support for this view (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">Schacter, Addis, &amp; Buckner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">Bar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">Peer, Salomon, Goldberg, Blanke, &amp; Arzy, 2015</xref>). Deficits in the ability to predict the future are known to be comorbid with deficits in episodic memory due to aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">Addis, Wong, &amp; Schacter, 2007</xref>) and neurological insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">Hassabis, Kumaran, Vann, &amp; Maguire, 2007</xref>). Some authors have even argued that optimal prediction could indeed be the guiding principle underlying the functional organization of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Friston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Clark, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Bialek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">Palmer, Marre, Berry, &amp; Bialek, 2015</xref>) and that there is a deep computational basis for the symmetry between memory and prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">Gershman, 2017</xref>). While many authors have suggested a symmetry between the mechanisms that allow us to access the past and the future, there is a dearth of behavioral paradigms that allow one to directly compare memory access for past and future events under controlled laboratory conditions.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">In this paper, we introduce a future-time analog of the relative judgment of recency (JOR) task. By analogy to the way the JOR evaluates participants’ ability to judge the relative time at which past events occurred, this new paradigm tests participants’ ability to judge the imminence of future events over the scale of a few seconds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The classic finding from short-term relative JOR tasks is that correct response time (RT) depends on the lag of the more recent probe but not the lag of the less recent probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">Muter, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Hacker, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Hockley, 1984</xref>) as illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2a</xref>. For decades, researchers have argued that this finding is consistent with a self-terminating backward scan along a temporally-organized memory representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">Muter, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Hacker, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Hockley, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">McElree &amp; Dosher, 1993</xref>). These models implicitly require a memory store that is organized in a way that maps onto the sequential order of experience. Because the scan starts at the present and proceeds backward in time, RTs show a recency effect. The finding that correct RTs do not depend on the lag of the less-recent probe is consistent with a self-terminating search. The data are as if participants stop the scanning process on correct trials once they find the more recent probe. This backward scanning account also naturally explains the finding that incorrect RTs depend on the lag of the (incorrectly) selected probe item under the assumption that errors occur because the scan continues past the correct probe.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4 xref-fig-1-5 xref-fig-1-6 xref-fig-1-7 xref-fig-1-8 xref-fig-1-9"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;229617v2/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><title hwp:id="title-4">Scanning over ordered representations of the past and the future in judgment of recency (JOR) and judgment of imminence (JOI).</title><p hwp:id="p-8"><bold>a.</bold> A hypothesis for ordered representations of the past and the future.

That is, in order for a memory store to be sequentially “scanned” it must be organized such that adjacent parts of the memory store correspond to adjacent items in the list. This is consistent with longstanding theories of human memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">James, 1890</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Brown, Neath, &amp; Chater, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">Balsam &amp; Gallistel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">Howard, Shankar, Aue, &amp; Criss, 2015</xref>) which argue further that in memory the temporal dimension coding for the past should be increasingly more compressed for a more distant time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Brown et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">Howard et al., 2015</xref>). That is, to account for the finding that memory gets worse for events further in the past, the memory store would devote more resources to recent events and less resources to events further in the past. If the memory store contained a veridical representation of experience, we would expect the time to scan to a probe should be a linear function of its recency—each traversal of a lag in the list should take the same amount of search time. In contrast, the progress made along the list in each moment of serial scanning of a <italic toggle="yes">compressed</italic> memory representation would depend on the degree of compression of that part of the list. Because compression becomes greater for items further in the past, we would expect to see a sublinear increase in RTs with lag (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-2" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2c</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1" hwp:id="xref-fn-3-1" hwp:rel-id="fn-3">1</xref></sup></p><p hwp:id="p-11">Thus far we have detailed predictions of a scanning model on measures of central tendency of RTs. However, scanning models make much stronger predictions. As the “focus of attention” moves backward in time over the memory representation during scanning, it can only acquire information about the region of memory currently in the focus. Consider this process from the perspective of a particular memory from a particular part of the list. Information about that region of memory can only become available after the scan has reached that location. Locations further in the past require additional scanning time before they can start communicating information about the contents of memory in that location. In the language of computational models of RT distributions, the self-terminating scanning model predicts that there should be a recency effect on the non-decision time—a parameter that measures the amount of time that passes before information begins to accumulate (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-11-1" hwp:rel-id="F11">Figure S7</xref>, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">Ratcliff, 1978</xref>). Prior JOR studies have confirmed this prediction by examining RT distributions for probes of different lag (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">Muter, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Hockley, 1984</xref>). Similar conclusions have been reached about the rate of information accumulation using the response signal procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">McElree &amp; Dosher, 1993</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-12">In order to compare memory for the past with predictions for the future, this study employs a novel judgment of imminence (JOI) paradigm to test predictions of the future. The relative JOR task requires the participant to select the probe item from the past list that was presented closer to the present (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). In contrast, the JOI paradigm asks participants to select the future probe item that <italic toggle="yes">is anticipated</italic> closer to the present (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-3" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). A self-terminating serial search model that scans backward through a compressed record of the past makes a number of predictions for response times—both central tendency and properties of the RT distribution—that are consistent with decades of work in memory research. If memory for the past and prediction of the future rely on the same kind of representation then we would expect that the brain can somehow implement an analogous scanning model over future time. Rather than scanning backward through memory, this model would scan forward through the predicted future to reach an anticipated event. The behavioral predictions of this model would be symmetric to the predictions described above for memory of the past (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-3" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2b,d</xref>). Observing this pattern of results would suggest that memory and prediction both generate a sequentially ordered representation of events and that we have comparable ability to make judgments about this information in working memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-6">Results</title><p hwp:id="p-13">We performed two experiments comparing memory for the past as measured by JOR and prediction of the future as measured by JOI. In Experiment 1 two different groups of participants performed JOR and JOI; in Experiment 2 the two tasks were administered to the same participants in different sessions. Because the results of the two experiments are so similar, we show figures with collapsed data in the main text; figures showing the results of the separate experiments are in the Supplemental Information. Because accuracy from JOR is consistent with previous studies and accuracy for JOI is qualitatively consistent with results from JOR, we discuss accuracy results in the Supplemental information.</p><p hwp:id="p-14">To anticipate the results, findings from median correct RTs and careful consideration of RT distributions converged on three primary conclusions. First, the pattern of results in memory and prediction were closely analogous, suggesting symmetry between memory and prediction. Second, the patterns of median RTs from both tasks were as predicted by a serial self-terminating search model over a compressed ordered representation.

This result is consistent with a self-terminating serial scanning model operating on a sequentially-organized compressed representation. The scanning model makes a much stronger quantitative prediction that goes beyond measures of central tendency in RT. Because information about a probe item should only become available when attention reaches the part of memory where the probe is found, this model predicts that the entire RT distribution for correct responses should be shifted as a function of the distance that must be scanned to find the probe.</p><p hwp:id="p-24">Our hypothesis requires us to evaluate whether the non-decision time changes with proximity. The additional supplemental material shows cumulative RT distributions separately for each participant in this study. To evaluate our hypothesis in the simplest way possible, we use a minimal non-parametric estimate of non-decision time. Consider how quantile plots as a function of log |lag| would look if the proximity effect was carried by a change in non-decision time or if it was due only to a change in drift rate (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-11-2" hwp:rel-id="F11">Figure S7</xref>). Because a change in non-decision time would move the entire RT distribution to the right, we would expect to see parallel curves as a function of log |lag| (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-12-1" hwp:rel-id="F12">Figure S8a</xref> right hand side). The particular shape of the RT distribution would control the spacing between the lines, but if the effect of log |lag| is solely <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the non-decision time, the lines connecting any particular quantile across lags should have the same slope. In contrast, if the effect of log |lag| was carried <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> drift rate, then the rate of information accumulation should decrease monotonically with the quantile chosen and result in an asymptotic slope of zero at very small quantiles (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-12-2" hwp:rel-id="F12">Figure S8a</xref> left hand side). Of course it is possible that recency affects both the non-decision time and rate of information accumulation. In this case, we would expect to see a combination of effects; the characteristic signature of a change in non-decision time is the non-zero slope as the quantile becomes very small.</p><p hwp:id="p-25"><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-1" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows RT quantiles as a function of log |lag| for both JOR and JOI collapsed over experiments (results for the two experiments separately can be found in Supplemental <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-14-1" hwp:rel-id="F14">Figure S10</xref>). For JOR, the curves appear to increase from right to left for every choice of quantile, including the lowest quantile at the bottom of the plot. In addition, there also appears to be a systematic change in the slope of the line, consistent with a change in the rate of information accumulation as a function of recency. The results for JOI are particularly striking, appearing to show parallel straight lines as a function of log lag. The curves not only increase from left to right at small quantiles (at the bottom of the plot), but increase by the same amount regardless of quantile. This suggests that in JOI, the effect of lag on RT was carried almost exclusively by a change in the non-decision time that was a function of log lag.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F4" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-4-1 xref-fig-4-2 xref-fig-4-3"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;229617v2/FIG4</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F4</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig4</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-4"><title hwp:id="title-15">Properties of RT distributions were consistent with the scanning hypothesis in both JOR and JOI.</title><p hwp:id="p-26">Response time as a function of lag for every decile across all the participants (together, Experiment 1 and Experiment 2).

If the proximity effect changes the non-decision time, as predicted by the scanning model, we would expect the Lag Modulation Factor to be constant and non-zero as quantile goes to zero.

In contrast, if proximity changed the drift rate, the change in RT should be primarily due to changes in the tails of the RT distribution. In that case, the effect of lag should decrease as one considers lower and lower quantiles. If lag affects the rate of information accumulation, then the Lag Modulation Factor should decrease continuously as the quantile approaches zero, leading to very different predictions (insert in <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-12-6" hwp:rel-id="F12">Figure S8b</xref> left).</p><p hwp:id="p-28"><xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-13-2" hwp:rel-id="F13">Figure S9a</xref> shows the Lag Modulation Factor as a function of quantile for each participant in Experiments 1 and 2.

In addition, a Bayesian t-test also showed “strong evidence” for the hypothesis that the slopes were different from 0 (JZS Bayes Factor = 17.0 in Experiment 1 and JZS Bayes Factor = 11.9 in Experiment 2), suggesting that there was also an effect on the rate of information accumulation. In JOI statistical results were even stronger in support of the scanning hypothesis. As in JOR, for intercepts in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 a Bayesian t-test showed “decisive evidence” favoring the hypothesis that they were different from 0 (JZS Bayes Factor &gt; 100 in both experiments), suggesting that there was a systematic change in the non-decision time with proximity. In addition, a Bayesian t-test also showed “strong evidence” that the slope was not different from 0 (JZS Bayes Factor = 5.9) in Experiment 1 and “substantial evidence” (JZS Bayes Factor = 2.0) in Experiment 2.

This study found that judgments of the imminence of future events have the same properties as judgments of the recency of past events. In both cases, the results are consistent with scanning models that posit that information is stored along an organized representation that can be sequentially accessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">Murdock, 1974</xref>). Because we did not separately manipulate time and ordinal position in either experiment, the present study does not disambiguate temporal and ordinal representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">Hintzman, 2004</xref>). In either case, the scanning hypothesis requires some form of sequential organization to memory and prediction. The major difference between memory and prediction is the direction of the scan—towards the past in the case of memory but towards the future in the case of prediction. In both cases, however, the scan extends away from the present, suggesting a symmetry between memory and prediction.</p><p hwp:id="p-30">Critically, scanning of both the past and the future suggests that the temporal representation is compressed, with decreasing accuracy for events further from the present. This compression is reflected in the sublinear increase of correct RT with distance from the present (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-17" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3c,d</xref>). In both cases we can certainly reject the hypothesis that RT increases linearly. The results are consistent with a number of forms of compression and we cannot make a strong conclusion about the precise quantitative form of the compression. However, the results are at least consistent with a logarithmic compression. Logarithmic compression is implied by the Weber-Fechner law and implements a scale-invariant temporal support, as predicted by quantitative models of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Brown et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">Howard et al., 2015</xref>).

First, the lists were presented at a much faster rate in JOR than in JOI. In JOR the list was presented quite quickly, with one item about every 180 ms, such that the entire list was complete in less than 3 s. In contrast, in JOI, the list was experienced much more slowly: a letter was presented every 1.4 s such that a single presentation of the list took about 18 s. Second, the participants in JOI had only a single list to remember throughout the session. In contrast, in JOR participants learned many lists using the same stimuli over the course of a session. In light of these procedural differences between the JOR task and the JOI task, the similarity of the core results is even more striking. Despite these differences the scanning rates across tasks were comparable, with about 220 ms per doubling of |lag| in JOR and about 340 ms per doubling in JOI.</p><p hwp:id="p-32">Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">Chan, Ross, Earle, &amp; Caplan, 2009</xref>) have reported that subtle differences in instructions given to participants can bias memory search. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">Chan et al.

An analogous manipulation is not possible in the JOI task used here because participants were trained on a continuous sequence. Future studies could explore the importance of instructions in JOI by changing the experimental paradigm such that participants are trained on lists of items with beginning and end, or perhaps lists containing distinctive items that function like landmarks. Scanning along the timeline of the future suggests that humans are able to deploy attention to different parts of the mental timeline.

In this view, the brain can predict the future using either a model-free or a model-based system; these two systems have different properties and can be brought to bear under appropriate circumstances (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">Daw, Niv, &amp; Dayan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46" hwp:id="xref-ref-46-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-46">Russek, Momennejad, Botvinick, Gershman, &amp; Daw, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">Momennejad et al., 2017</xref>). The results of the experiments in this paper are difficult to reconcile with either the model-free or model-based systems as currently understood.</p><p hwp:id="p-34">Model-free learning efficiently extracts predicted outcomes that follow from a stimulus. A major benefit of model-free learning is that knowledge of outcomes is cached so that they can be rapidly accessed, avoiding the relatively costly computation associated with the model-based system. For instance, the successor representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Dayan, 1993</xref>) is a computational method that enables rapid learning of exponentially-weighted future out-comes that follow a particular stimulus. The successor representation has many properties that have made it attractive to cognitive neuroscientists (e.g., <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-55-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-55">Stachenfeld, Botvinick, &amp; Gershman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">Momennejad et al., 2017</xref>). Because the successor representation more strongly weights events that are likely to happen closer in time to the present, it would be straightforward to predict a lag effect in JOI using the successor representation to generate a strength for each probe. Moreover, this effect of lag would be sublinear because as the successor representation weights future outcomes in an exponentially-discounted manner. This is at least roughly consistent with the results in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-18" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3d</xref>. However, because the strengths of both probes are cached, there is no reason to expect that there would not be a strong interaction between the two probes and a robust distance effect in RT. This is in sharp contrast to the lack of a distance effect on correct RT (horizontal lines in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-19" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>) and the account of these results based on scanning. Similarly, there is no reason to expect that the time it takes to retrieve a cached strength depends on proximity, so it would be difficult to reconcile the RT quantile plots in JOI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-2" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure 4</xref>) with the output of the successor representation.</p><p hwp:id="p-35">In contrast, a model-based account is perfectly consistent with a scanning hypothesis. The model-based system is believed to store the transition probabilities between stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">Daw et al., 2005</xref>). Predictions at successive time points can be simulated by repeatedly applying the matrix of transition probabilities to the current state. At each time step, one could compare the predicted future to the probes and stop when a match is found. Although the model-based system is well-positioned to build a scanning model, it is not clear why the growth in RTs would be sublinear. If one accepts the quantitative argument that the growth of RTs is logarithmic, which implies that the rate of applying the transition matrix must somehow increase exponentially in order to account for the data.</p><p hwp:id="p-36">We have seen that the behavioral findings from JOI are consistent with serial self-terminating search of a compressed ordered representation of the future.

The JOI task was designed to mirror the JOR task, allowing direct comparison (however, since JOI task required participants to learn a sequence of letters prior to testing, there were several methodological differences between the two tasks). The classic finding in JOR is that the response time (RT) for correct judgments varies as a function of the lag to the more recent probe and does not depend on the lag to the less recent probe. Based on this finding, many authors suggested a backward self-terminating search model operating on an ordered representation of the past. In the JOI task, it was found that correct RT depends on the lag to the more imminent probe and does not depend on the lag to the less imminent probe. This suggests a forward self-terminating search model operating on an organized representation of the future. These findings were supported by detailed consideration of RT distributions. This result supports the hypothesis that there is a deep symmetry between the psychological processes that underlie our ability to remember the past and make predictions about the future. Both memory for the past and predictions of the future appear to rely on a compressed, ordered representation.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-19">Acknowledgment</title><p hwp:id="p-40">We thank Rebecca DiDomenica, Jodi Manning, Laxmi Nair, Arun Sidhu, Anita Wong, Sarah Dillard and Michelle Wiciak for their help in collecting the data.</p></ack><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-13"><title hwp:id="title-20">Methods</title><sec id="s5a" hwp:id="sec-14"><title hwp:id="title-21">Experiment 1: Judgment of Recency (JOR)</title><p hwp:id="p-41">The procedure of this experiment followed closely the procedure of Experiment 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Hacker (1980)</xref>. Participants were presented with a list of 9, 11, or 13 consonants at the rate of 5.5 letters per second.

Throughout the duration of the experiment, the participants saw letters drawn from this ring. With a probability of 0.9, the participants saw the next letter in the sequence. With probability 0.1, a random letter was chosen from the sequence that wasn’t the letter just shown to the participant. A presentation list of 1550 letters was generated using this procedure and presented to the participants one at a time over the course of the entire experiment from beginning to end.

After sixty letters were shown to the participants (about 1.5 min), the initial training round ended and the experimenter initiated an abbreviated practice round for the actual task with the relative judgment probes (see below). The sequence continued for about two minutes. During this time participants were given twenty probes asking them to make predictions about relative order judgments of the future. The goal of this task practice round was to show the participants what the final task is so that they are motivated to pay attention to the sequence. After two minutes of this round, the training resumed and the participants were shown just the training sequence without any probes for another three minutes.</p></sec><sec id="s5e" hwp:id="sec-19"><title hwp:id="title-26">Probes</title><p hwp:id="p-48">After each letter from the list, a probe was shown with a probability of 0.3. The probe consisted of two letters that were presented side by side. The participants were told that they will continue to see the letters one at a time and that sometimes two letters will be presented side by side. The task was to predict which of the two letters will appear sooner using the “Left”/“Right” key. For instance, in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-7" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1c, t</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-8" hwp:rel-id="F1">g</xref> are presented and the participant is asked to predict which of the two is more imminent. The correct answer here is t since it is two steps from the current position in the sequence <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> g which is five steps in the sequence. The instructions clarified that they were not necessarily required to choose the next letter in the sequence (although that would sometimes be the case) but the one that would appear sooner. Probes were not shown one after another; at least one letter from the sequence was displayed before the next probe. If the participants failed to make a response in 4 s, they were shown a message,“Faster” for 0.2 s and then the task continued. About 1.3% of trials resulted in a time-out. On average the participants were shown 406 probes. The first 10% of the probes (these included the probes shown in training) were omitted from further analyses. The post-training round lasted for about thirty minutes with two intermediate breaks.</p><p hwp:id="p-49">Based on pilot studies and debriefing interviews, it was found that participants were particularly cognizant of pairwise associations between the letters in the sequence. In order to eliminate an account based on simple pairwise associations between the probes, we did not present probes that contained stimuli that would be expected to be presented successively. For instance, in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-9" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, if the more imminent item in the probe was x, the less imminent item could not be q. The two probe letters were sampled from the next 7 positions in the transition ring. The lag of the more imminent item varied from 1 (next in the sequence) to 5. For each of these more imminent items, the less imminent items were chosen using predetermined combinations. The points were sampled such that, where possible, there were three less imminent probes for each more imminent probe. For instance, when the lag of the more imminent probe was 1 (next item), the less imminent item was chosen from a lag of 3, 5, or 7. When the more imminent probe was at a lag of 3, the less imminent probe was chosen from lags of 5, 6, or 7. Since only the next 7 positions are probed, a more imminent probe at a lag of 4 can only be paired with a less imminent probe at a lag of 6 and 7. A more imminent probe at a lag of 6 can only be probed with a more imminent pairing at a lag of 7.</p></sec><sec id="s5f" hwp:id="sec-20"><title hwp:id="title-27">Participants</title><p hwp:id="p-50">Sixty healthy young adults were recruited from Boston University to participate in one session each and were paid $15 per hour for their time.

We are interested to know if the lag of both of the probes affects correct RT or if only the lag of the correct probe does. One might have simply put these two variables (perhaps recording them using a distance between the two probes) into a linear regression. However the recencies/imminencies are not sampled equally. Moreover, the effect of lag appears to be non-linear (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-2" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. S3</xref>). Using a straightforward linear model carries the risk of a spurious distance effect due to residuals from a non-linear and unequally sampled relationship.</p><p hwp:id="p-54">In order to control for these effects, the following two-step strategy was used. First, the distance effect was quantified by calculating the slopes of the lines joining the dependent variable as a function of the less salient independent variable. For instance, in <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-2" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure S2</xref> the lines for the correct RT appear to be flat. Thus the median RT does not appear to depend on the lag of the less recent probe. In order to quantify this intuition, the slope of each line was calculated for each participant. In order to ascertain whether these slopes are meaningfully different from 0 or not, a Bayesian t-test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">Rouder et al., 2009</xref>) was performed on the slopes obtained for each participant. If a particular variable did not contribute to the dependent variable, it was excluded as a factor in a subsequent linear mixed effect analysis. Thus the purpose of this analysis was simply to ascertain whether a factor meaningfully contributed to the dependent variable. Once the relevant factors affecting the dependent variable were ascertained, further analyses were performed with the relevant variables. The function of the linear mixed effect analysis is simply to determine whether the apparent effect of the more salient variable is statistically reliable.

First, participants might not properly encode the more recent probe and simply scan past it until reaching the less recent probe. In that case, the lag of a less recent probe does not impact the accuracy. Second, the noise level in the evidence accumulation process might be large enough such that participants do not accumulate enough evidence for the more recent probe when they reach the less recent probe during the scanning process. Consistent with the second explanation, the results reported here support a hypothesis that items on the timeline are represented with broad overlapping fields that have sequential peaks.</p><fig id="figS4" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F8" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-8-1 xref-fig-8-2 xref-fig-8-3 xref-fig-8-4 xref-fig-8-5 xref-fig-8-6 xref-fig-8-7"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;229617v2/FIGS4</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F8</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">figS4</object-id><label>Figure S4.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-8"><title hwp:id="title-36">Accuracy in JOR and JOI across the two experiments.</title><p hwp:id="p-63">This figure is analogous to <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-2" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure S1</xref>, but with results for each experiment shown separately.

Keeping in mind that JOI had fewer pairs of more and less imminent lags than JOR, an additional reason for this finding could be in the fact that in JOR participants could use “UP” button to indicate that they do not remember seeing the probe items in a given trial. Availability of “UP” button in JOR and not JOI was motivated by the fact that in JOI participants have seen all the items many times. On the other hand, if participants did not pay much attention during a particular JOR trial, they might not remember seeing the probe items. However, this also resulted in participants making more guesses in JOI than in JOR, making it harder to find the distance effect.</p><fig id="figS7" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F11" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-11-1 xref-fig-11-2"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;229617v2/FIGS7</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F11</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">figS7</object-id><label>Figure S7.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-11"><title hwp:id="title-40">Illustration of two memory search hypotheses: parallel and serial.</title><p hwp:id="p-73">In parallel models evidence for each item is immediately available and it is accumulating at a larger rate for items with smaller lag (top row).

In parallel models evidence for each item is immediately available and it is accumulating at a larger rate for items with smaller lag. Therefore the RT distributions for different lags have the same origin, but they increase at different rates. As a consequence, the parallel search hypothesis predicts that the effect of lag should decrease with the quantile of the RT distribution. In serial models, items are accessed in sequential order. Therefore the evidence for items with smaller lags starts to accumulate earlier than the evidence for the items with larger lags. Consequently, RT distributions for different lags are shifted with respect to one another.
