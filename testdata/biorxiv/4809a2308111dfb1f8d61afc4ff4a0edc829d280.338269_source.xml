Biological entities having intrinsic self-assembling properties are recognized as an excellent aspect in nanotechnology applications [1-4]. The coat protein of viruses are the kind of self-assembling peptides which form a fine architecture at a nanoscale precision is called capsid. Recently viruses are being studied for their ability to self-assemble into the nanoscale particles of discrete size and definite geometry [5-7]. These self-assembling features of viruses have been used as nanoscaffolds for a wide range of innovative applications in various fields such as sensing, imaging, drug delivery, biocatalysis and bioelectronics [8]. Viral nanotechnology is a newly emerging multi-disciplinary area, has begun to manipulate hundreds of both mammalian and plant pathogenic viruses towards the next-generation smart nanodevices [9,10]. The reason of sudden emergence of virus nanotechnology is the search for the solutions to several fundamental challenges in nanoparticles fabrication, that is, controlling the traits of synthetic nanoparticles such as monodispersity, assembly, stability, size and morphology [11]. Viruses derive portions of their structures from peptide-based complexes called ‘capsids’. These complexes form nanoscale structures that are often self-assembling, monodispersing, symmetric and stable under general physiological conditions [12, 13]. These tiny structures, also described as viral nano-particles (VNPs) by materials science researchers, possess numerous traits that make them outstanding candidates for nanoresearch. Another superior choice for biomedical researchers is virus-like particles (VLPs), a non-infectious counterpart from plant viruses. These are particularly advantageous because they are less likely to be pathogenic in humans and therefore less likely to induce undesirable side effects [8]. They can be easily produced in sufficient quantities with recombinant technologies. In addition, their properties are easily programmable through changes at the genome level to produce novel functionalities[14].The VLPs that are currently being developed for biomedical applications share the common property of being self-assembling – they form a closed capsid-like structure with an altered symmetryfrom a limited number of protein subunits, which are also referred to by various terms with the prefix of “nano”-cage, -carrier, -cargo, and -container[8]. This states that an interior environment is capable of housing, therapeutic or imaging agents and the exterior environment is capable of multivalent presenting for cell targeting [4,15,16]. There are many studies that have reviewed the self-assembling properties of various kinds of animal and plant virus particles under various <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> conditions such as temperature, pH, and ionic strength [5, 17-22]. In particular, three plant viruses have been studied more than hundred times by various researchers across the country specifically for nanotechnology applications: <italic toggle="yes">Cowpea mosaic virus, Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Tobacco mosaic virus</italic> [8, 23]. Though a few species of viruses have been studied extensively for nanotechnology purposes, there is a need for a new kind of virus that is superior to existing ones. Indeed, exploring novel VNPs or VLPs and their self-assembling properties will lead to novel ideas and concepts for fabrication for human welfare. With this aim, we chose a well-known plant pathogenic virus of the <italic toggle="yes">Begomovirus</italic> isolates of <italic toggle="yes">Squash leaf curl China virus</italic> (SLCCNV) for this study, whose molecular pathogenicity we had already established in our laboratory studies. The true reason for our choice of this virus is no study yet to done to reveal the structural and assembly properties of <italic toggle="yes">Begomoviruses</italic>, which are also crucial for coat-host protein interaction mediated pathogenicity studies.</p><p hwp:id="p-16">The <italic toggle="yes">Squash leaf curl China virus</italic> (SLCCNV), a plant pathogenic virus, is one of the 200 species in the <italic toggle="yes">Begomoviruses</italic> genus and belongs to the <italic toggle="yes">Geminiviridae</italic> family [24]<italic toggle="yes">. Begomoviruses</italic> are responsible for the huge loss of many economically important crops such as tomatoes, chilly, cassava, squash and cotton [24, 25].The genome of <italic toggle="yes">Squash leaf curl China virus</italic> (SLCCNV) and other members of this genus generally consists of a single-stranded (SS) DNA molecule (5422 bp in size). It encodes eight open reading frames, where the AV1 gene (771bp) of the coat protein (CP), represents a twinned icosahedral capsid morphology which encapsulates the whole nucleic acid genome [26]. Interestingly, all members of the <italic toggle="yes">Geminiviridae</italic> have the unique capsid morphology of geminate particles (non-enveloped), consisting of two incomplete T=1 icosahedral joined together to produce a structure with 22 pentameric capsomers, made of 110 identical CP subunits, each consisting of approximately 30 kDa (256 AA) with an isoelectric point (pI) of 10 [27, 28]. The size of the virus particle is ∼38 nm in length and 22 nm in diameter.</p><p hwp:id="p-17">This research work aimed to unveil the self-assembling properties of the native SLCCNV particles as well as <italic toggle="yes">Pichia</italic> expressed SLCCNV coat protein subunits towards. We chose the assembly buffer medium as a reflection of the biological conditions in the intracellular environment [29,30]. To support this experimental study, a detailed <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> analysis was also performed to predict the SLCCNV coat protein structure, assembly and its conjugation sites. [31-33]. In vitro A549 cell line studies also demonstrated biocompatible properties of SLCCNV coat protein. A successful <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> self-assembly is valid only if it can be exploited to selectively entrap materials within the mechanisms of the SLCCNV-CP-assembly. By encapsulation with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) it was also confirmed [34]. MNPs were used in this study because of their wide range of application ranging from medical diagnosis to treatment [35;36].</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-5">Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-6">Materials</title><p hwp:id="p-18">All the chemicals for growth media and supplements were purchased from Himedia Laboratories, India.

Further, screenings and confirmations were made by molecular studies including PCR amplification with coat protein-specific primers, which was already reported in our previous work [37]. The virus particles or so-called viral nanoparticles (VNPs) were purified by cesiumsulfate (Cs<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) density gradient ultracentrifugation (CP100WX, HITACHI, JAPAN) using fixed angle rotor P100AT2 (803,000xg) and swing bucket rotor P55ST2 (366,000 x g) with necessary modifications [38]. Purified fractions of virus proteins were collected and dialyzed against 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) to remove the remnants of Cs<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The purity of the native virus particles was also confirmed through SDS-PAGE followed by a western blot analysis [39,40].

The methylotrophic yeast <italic toggle="yes">Pichia pastoris</italic> GS115 strain was applied as a host cell to express SLCCNV coat protein [41]. The plasmid pPICZαA containing methanol-inducible AOX1 promoter was used to construct the full length SLCCNV coat protein gene [42]. The major advantage of using pPICZαA (3.6 kb) vector for expression is the presence of a Zeocin-resistant gene for selection, which has an alpha-factor secretion signal for directing the secreted expression of the recombinant protein into the growth medium [43].</p></sec><sec id="s2d" hwp:id="sec-6"><title hwp:id="title-9">Construction of expression vector</title><p hwp:id="p-21">To design an insert for expression, a complete coat protein gene (771bp) from the AV1 region of DNA-A of SLCCNV was taken from our own nucleotide deposit in the NCBI repository (GenBank accession no.<bold>KF188433.1</bold>) [37]. The sense and anti-sense primers KKCPF-5’-CCGGAATTCATGGCGAAGCGACCACCACCAGATA-3’ and KKCPR-5’-CCGGGTACCAT TTGTTACCGAATCCATAAAA-3’ capable of generating a 771-bp coat protein gene fragment (256 amino acids) containing double restriction enzyme sites (<italic toggle="yes">Eco</italic>RI and <italic toggle="yes">Kpn</italic>I) were designed using the BioEdit 7.1 software [44]. To express the pure form of SLCCNV coat protein without the C-terminal peptide, stop codon (5’ cap, <italic toggle="yes">poly</italic>-A tail) had been included in the anti-sense primer. By PCR amplification, the double-stranded oligonucleotide fragments corresponding to a CP protein of SLCCNV, with <italic toggle="yes">Eco</italic>RI and <italic toggle="yes">Kpn</italic>I cohesive ends, were obtained by annealing (63˚C-65˚C) the sense and anti-sense primers using the whole SLCCNV genome as a template. The PCR-obtained CP gene fragments of SLCCNV were inserted into multiple cloning sites (MCS) of pPICZαA vector in the C-terminal in-frame fusion.

Screening of recombinants was confirm with SLCCNV coat protein, specific primers at 771bp. Subsequently, positive clones were used for the analysis of the methanol-utilizing phenotype. The Mut+ phenotype for the transformed GS115 cells was determined by growing clones on a minimal methanol medium with histidine (MMH) and a minimal dextrose medium with histidine (MDH) plates. A single transformed colony of GS115 was grown in 200ml of BMGY (Buffered Glycerol-Complex Medium) at 28–30˚C and at the agitation rate of 250 RPM. The cells (OD600 = 2-6) were harvested and resuspended in 500 ml of BMMY (Buffered Methanol-Complex medium) in a 1L triple-side baffled flask (OD600 = 1.0) to induce expression at 28–30˚C. Absolute methanol was added to a final concentration of 0.5% every 24 hours to maintain induction for up to four days. Each day, 1ml of the supernatant was collected to optimize the protein expression profile of transforming Mut<sup>+</sup> phenotype cells. The collected supernatant was subjected to electrophoretic separation on a 12% polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and stained by silver nitrate according to the standard procedure [39]. Following electrophoresis, proteins were electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane and immunoblotted with an ACMV primary antibody specific to the <italic toggle="yes">Begomovirus</italic> coat protein. The secondary HRP enzyme conjugated antibody used to detect the protein of interest at the end [40]. The concentrated supernatant of GS115 transformed with an empty vector (pPICZαA) was used as the negative control in both tests. The percentage of <italic toggle="yes">Pichia</italic>-expressed SLCCNV-CP was then determined by ELISA with the known concentration of the ultracentrifuge-purified native virus protein as a positive control [40].</p></sec><sec id="s2f" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-11">Purification and characterization of expressed SLCCNV-CP</title><p hwp:id="p-23">At the end of the fourth day of culture in BMMY, the supernatant was harvested by high-speed cooling centrifugation (10000 RPM), after it was concentrated (10-to 100-fold) by the usage of 75% ammonium sulphate precipitation [46]. The precipitant was further dialyzed against a 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) to eliminate the ammonium salts. Then the concentration of protein was determined by absorbance measurement at 280nm (1cm path length) with an extinction coefficient of 3.4. The ion exchange chromatography (IEC) purification was performed based on the chromato-focussing method. This method was chosen to separate the SLCCNV-CP according to the pI (isoelectric point) and its theoretically determined pKa values [17]. To purify the coat protein from the active ammonium sulfate fraction, one millilitre of the fraction was loaded into the ACTA purifier (GE Healthcare) in 5ml of HiTrap ion exchange column. The column was pre-equilibrated with buffer A and buffer B. The unbound proteins were washed with the same buffer and the bound proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of salt (1M NaCl) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluted fractions containing the SLCCNV-CP were pooled and stored at −80˚C. The obtained fractions were analyzed at 12% SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE bands containing the protein of interest were excised from stained gels and subjected to the in-gel trypsin digestion procedure as described elsewhere [47, 48]. Spectral measurements were taken using an Ultraflex III MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Germany)in the positive ion reflector mode for acquiring the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) at the International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi, India. Tandem mass spectrometry-based fragmentation was employed to identify the protein from the observed peptide precursor ions. The instrument parameters for PMF (peptide mass fingerprinting) and MS/MS analysis were set as described elsewhere [48]. The fragmented peptides were analyzed using flexAnalysis software (version 3.0) and sent to database search using BioTools software (version 3.2). The database search parameters were set as described [48] and fragment masses with MS tolerance of up to +/-100 ppm and MS/MS tolerance of up to +/-0.75 Da were searched in the NCBInr database. The following criteria were used for identification: (i) significance threshold was set to achieve p&lt;0.05, (ii) the expectancy cut-off was set to 0.05, and (iii) individual ion score ≥ 45 was only considered for identification.</p></sec><sec id="s2g" hwp:id="sec-9"><title hwp:id="title-12">Investigation of self-assembly of SLCCNV (native and <italic toggle="yes">Pichia</italic>-expressed)</title><p hwp:id="p-24"><italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> assembly were performed by the conventional dialysis method (15kDa cut-off membrane) against various pH assembly buffers.

The DLS results also greatly correlated with the HRTEM observation and it was shown that the structures were in a highly dispersed state, with two different sizes of population ranging at ∼60nm and ∼510nm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-3" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 5A</xref> Panel 1).

Also, we observed aggregated population of CP monomers in the same electron micrograph. The DLS for the same (pH 9) buffer medium also revealed that there were two populations of aggregated particles with the size of ∼100nm and ∼700nm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-5" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 5B</xref> Panel 1).

The docking method was performed with an RMSD of 4.0.

The atomic contact energy (ACE) score was observed for each subunit assembly (Table 1). The docking area increased with an increase in the number of subunits, which has relatively decreased the contact energy resulting in the efficient binding of two protein structures. The atomic contact energy score is based on the number of water contacts replaced by the atomic contacts from the proteins. The atomic contact energy provides an estimation of the free energy of the protein interactions. The lower ACE configuration suggests lower free energy, which is more favourable for the formation of pentameric structure [65]. Therefore, the pentameric assembly can be achieved by monomer and dimer intermediates [66]. Using Accelrys Discovery Studio 2.5. with Connelly-type modelling, the relative solvent accessible surface areas (SASA) in the pentameric structure of coat protein could be clearly figured out.

However, the original extinction peak for unmodified MNPs changed to a low-intensity peak when encapsulated with SLCCNV-CP monomers, which was reflected by the strong difference in the extinction peak. This reversible change in the extinction spectrum clearly demonstrates that the MNPs are stabilized and might be dispersed by the particle in solution. That condition is entirely due to decreased photon absorption by SLCCNV-CP-nanocargo with MNPs. Encapsulation also confirmed at protein gel electrophoresis without staining.

However, the band in the middle of the gel may resulted by few MNP particles encapsulated by SLCCNV-CP at a time, which decreased the mobility of SLCCNV-CP and kept them in the middle of the gel.

This challenge was overcome successfully by manipulating a plant pathogenic virus to useful scaffolds in the field of biomedical nanotechnology. Here, we chose to study the self-assembling properties of <italic toggle="yes">Squash leaf curl China virus</italic> (SLCCNV) of both native whole virus and <italic toggle="yes">Pichia</italic>-expressed virus coat protein monomers. For the first time ever, complete SLCCNV-CP monomeric identical subunits of <italic toggle="yes">Squash leaf curl China virus</italic> (SLCCNV) were successfully expressed through a heterologous expression system using methylotrophic yeast <italic toggle="yes">Pichia pastoris</italic>. In our study, the usual problem associated with prokaryotic expression at post-translational modification for virus proteins (insoluble proteins) was overcome by <italic toggle="yes">Pichia</italic> expression system[19, 20]. By using pPICZαA vector specific to the secretion expression, a protein of our interest was easily isolated from the culture medium by simple centrifugation at 10,000rpm for ten minutes. As a result of these, it was easier to purify the coat protein by ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) after ammonium sulfate precipitation (Figure S3). IEC facilitates the purification of SLCCNV-CP at their pKa values. The IEC can be switched between charged and neutral depending on the pH. It was able to purify the expressed protein without any fusion proteins which might affect the homogeneity of the virus protein. Thus, using heterologous expression yields a high titer of SLCCNV-CP (0.57mg/ml) in the end compared to ultracentrifugation-purified native or native virus proteins (0.241mg/ml) (Figure S2). The sensitivity and specificity of <italic toggle="yes">Begomovirus</italic> coat protein detection was high in the Western blot analysis using polyclonal ACMV antibody. It also meant that the expressed virus proteins were properly refolded and that they retained their antigenic properties, (antigenicity) which was confirmed by the antibody’s affinity to the epitope of the coat protein. The identification of <italic toggle="yes">Pichia</italic>-expressed SLCCNV coat protein through MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) showed a significant similarity with other <italic toggle="yes">Begomovirus</italic> species when analyzed through Mascot database searching.

MALDI-TOF data could provide valuable insights into the <italic toggle="yes">Begomovirus</italic> coat protein and its key role in pathogenesis for future structural study and comprehensive research. Significantly, we confirmed the isoelectric point (pI) of the coat protein monomer as 10 by the MALDI-TOF analysis for first the time. During SDS-PAGE, we observed a novel feature of the <italic toggle="yes">Begomovirus</italic> capsid structural integrity which has never been reported elsewhere[17]. Denaturing agents can disintegrate viral structural proteins only at a high temperature (85˚C–90˚C), which has been confirmed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and DSC analysis. This feature was also evidenced by the <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> analysis, that the 3D structure of coat protein monomer has shown the existence of an abundance of random coil, alpha helix and few beta strand. This ratio in the secondary structure can cause the coat protein to be thermodynamically stable at the standard protein denaturing temperature [69]. Moreover, the native virus particles were tremendously stable during dialysis against both acidic and alkali buffers, as were evidenced by HRTEM and DLS data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-4" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). It understood that only high temperatures or peptide digestive enzymes of protease (either host or virus origin) can cause the cleavage of virus capsids, making them disassociate [70]. A similar kind of stability of virus particles has been observed and reported previously [8].</p><p hwp:id="p-43">This investigation of the self-assembly of <italic toggle="yes">Pichia</italic>-expressed SLCCNV-CP has provided unambiguous evidence that it has an inherent ability to self-assemble in a solution without nucleic acid. This point was revealed after examining the ultrafine structures observed on HRTEM images, which were the outcome of the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> self-assembly of numerous capsomeric proteins into a defined structure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-7" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure4</xref> &amp;<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-8" hwp:rel-id="F5">5</xref>). In this experiment, the assembly pH buffers are act as a cytosolic buffer system which facilitates an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> assembly of virus coat protein similar in the natural process.</p><p hwp:id="p-44">The pH must have acted as one of the fundamental driving processes for the coat protein self-assembly by the protonation and deprotonation of amino acids [71]. The data obtained from the <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> analysis also very much correlating with the results of pH mediated assembly. However, coat protein structure prediction reveals that the subunits consist of a larger proportion of both random coil and alpha helix, which obviously makes the SLCCNV coat protein much more affinity to a hydrogen atom (H) present in the solutions [72]. Basically, protein systems are inherently capable of forming H-bonds in their main chain and side chain amino acids. These groups can, therefore, tend to be responsive while presenting the protein at the various pH environments, and we are bound to agree with another report by Casper (1963) [73] which pinpoints the key role of pH in protein assembly. He suggests that protons are hydrogen-bonded to carboxyl-carboxylate pairs and that they prevent the normal electrostatic repulsion such groups would have on each other. If the two carboxyl groups were ionized, this repulsion could strain the subunit structure and lead to dissolution. This may account for the great sensitivity of the SLCCNV-CP assembly towards change in pH. Thus, the viral coat protein assembly process was found to be very well synchronized with pH and ionic strength [74, 29]. However, altering the pH from acidic to basic could cause a structural transition of virus coat proteins from an undetermined structure (self-assembled aggregates) into a “Nanocargo”-like structure. Besides, the DLS results were clear examples of this phenomenon of structure-associated conformational changes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-8" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure 4</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-9" hwp:rel-id="F5">5</xref>). Thereby, it can be assumed that the calcium ions also have a significant role in the assembly process next to the pH buffer. There are few studies also available to describing the impact of calcium ions in the virus assembly [20, 30, 49,50]. According to that study, calcium ions reportedly act as a chaperon to specifically bind and bring the coat protein subunits together to assemble like a virion capsid. This statement of the study also proved by our intensive study with the bioinformatics tools of PatchDock and Molsoft ICM-Pro modelling. Using bioinformatics tools we found a particular intermediate amino acid residues constituting the members of the binding site between the coat protein monomers identified as Isoleucine (I14), Valine (V60) and Glutamic acid (E78) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-3" hwp:rel-id="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Both Isoleucine and Valine are hydrophobic branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) having an aliphatic side chain and Glutamic acid is polar hydrophilic and negatively charged by its carboxylic acid side chain. Therefore, it assumed that the available BCAA residues primarily neutral at physiological pH should have aliphatic–aliphatic interactions which are known to be a hydrophobic interaction facilitates interaction between the monomer to a monomer [75].</p><p hwp:id="p-45">These features also make capsomers are thermodynamically stable and also weak in the ionization of pH variation. The previous studies reveals the features of glutamic acid and its natural affinity on the calcium ion [42,53,76]. The calcium ion affinity on the viral coat protein assembly also discussed by few earlier reports [77,59]. According to their study, the <italic toggle="yes">Satellite tobacco necrosis virus</italic> (STNV) was able to assemble in the presence of calcium ions at interfaces between the coat protein subunits. They infer/concluded that incorporation of calcium ions into aspartate and glutamate residues contributed to coordinate the STNV capsid assembly in a proper symmetry. Also some studies cited that incorporation of calcium ions into plant virus capsid is typically observed and thought to be involved in viral assembly [29,30,49,59]. Now it has become clear that BCAA residues (I14, V60) and glutamic acid (E78) residues are the intermediates that serve as a principal inter-monomer contact, and these contacts are stabilized by pH and calcium ions. Those intermediate interactions presumably can assemble the monomeric form of tertiary structures with further assembly around the existing protein particle that acts as nucleation point, which resulted in high structural organization of quaternary structure of pentamer that must possess a buried hydrophobic core [78]. Thereby, under physiological conditions similar to the intracellular environment, SLCCNV-CP monomers randomly moved and bound one another by their complementary binding sites, resulting in a novel ‘‘Nanocargo’’-like structure without the aid of an infectious nucleic acid. From the SASA docking results, it was established that there were no hydrophobic residues exposed in the outer regions of the pentameric structure predicted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-5" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Therefore, solvent accessible hydrophilic residues of possibly positively charged residues of lysine, arginine and histidine might be coordinate with negatively charged nucleic acids can facilitate an error-free assembly of a capsid structure [79]. However, the self-assembly and resultant particle morphology is completely reversible upon variation of pH and the number of capsid proteins present in the reaction solution. Any increase in concentration can cause further aggregation around the existing protein particle aggregation that acts as nucleation point, which contributes to the cooperation effect [80].</p><p hwp:id="p-46">Certainly, there is much demand for ingeniously self-assembled protein as a cargo material for usage in targeted therapeutic delivery [4]. Moreover, protein surface bound amino acid residues are most suitable as bioconjugation sites than chemically modified ones [81].Our self-assembled SLCCNV-CP-Nanocargo are composed of many identical copies of coat protein which consist of amino acid side chains found to be most suitable for bioconjugation than any others previously reported [8].These were predicted by the same Molsoft ICM-Pro bioinformatics tool which has predicted nine potential conjugation sites available on the exterior surface of SLCCNV coat protein monomer such as Lysine, Tyrosine, Aspartic acid, Glutamic acid, Glycine, Asparagine, Arginine, Valine and Threonine (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-4" hwp:rel-id="F7">Figure 7B</xref>) [81-82]. No free Cysteine side chains predicted which is one of the popular site for the bioconjugation methodology. The predicted available side chains, particularly amine group containing Lys, carboxylate group containing Asp then Glu, aromatic group containing Tyr are the most common bioconjugation residues utilized for the conjugation chemistry for a stable covalent link between molecules [8]. Moreover, they are the groups predominantly available on the surface of the pentameric coat protein structure. The remaining amino acids Gly, Asp, Arg, Val, and Thr are used as alternatives and specifically to tether the molecules via ionic and hydrophobic interactions with chemical intermediates. These are the residues of functional groups responsible for the interaction of the protein with other molecules [81-82]. In this regard, SLCCNV-CP-Nanocargo can be functionally modified with any kind of molecules to become “smart hybrid materials” for potential applications. It is also possible to encapsulate any small molecules (either polar or non-polar), in a single step by SLCCNV-CP-Nanocargos [8]. Their efficiency would be directed by the concentration and the relative ratio between SLCCNV coat protein and specific molecules, making them one of the finest virus hybrid materials. An important question that we have the answer now is about the biocompatible properties of SLCCNV-”Nanocargo”. There are only few studies reported the biocompatible properties of plant virus nanoparticles previously [8]. From the cell cytotoxicity assay, it was strongly determined that using plant virus like particles for furthering any biomedical application studies would be considered safe. The purified SLCCNV-CP has proved to be a potential biocompatibility material among the existing classes of protein biomaterials and that it can be used without any modification to enhance the pharmacokinetic properties in the clinical trials. Thus, now we have disclosed all the potential answers for the possible SLCCNV coat protein assembly both experimentally and computationally.</p><p hwp:id="p-47">Finally, the capability of self-assembled SLCCNV-CP as “Nanocargo” was determined by using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as a core to encapsulate coat protein monomers. Under optimal assembly (pH 7.0 - 8.0) conditions, encapsulation occurs spontaneously by mixing the protein subunits with cargo particles (MNPs) at a detectable level by UV-Vis absorbance, SDS-PAGE, HRTEM and EDX (see figure 16). The absorbance peak variation between free MNPs and coat protein-encapsulated MNPs clearly denotes the possible “Nanocargo” process (figure 16 A). Similarly, the principle of the separation technique of SDS-PAGE separated both free MNPs and coat protein-encapsulated MNPs by size (figure 16 B). The SLCCNV coat protein facilitates the mobility of encapsulated MNP and MNPs electrophoretically. At the HRTEM images, the fine results were observed, which correlated well with other results in this section (figure 16 C &amp; D). This kind of encapsulation initiated via electrostatic interactions of the coat proteins with negatively charged magnetic particles results in SLCCNV-CP as an artificial Nanocargo. It is not surprising, then, that, the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> reconstitution of such virus coat protein is driven by electrostatic interactions. It is for the same reason that the virus coat protein shows an amazing ability to encapsulate not only its genetic materials but also non-native genetic materials like surface functionalized nanoparticles and other molecules. An understanding of the physical principles underlying the spontaneous encapsulation of negatively charged particles could help realize the envisaged applications in medical imaging and controlled drug release. Now, the objective of this work has helped reach the conclusion that using SLCCNV-CP-Nanocargo, encapsulation can be enabled in any other species (genomic or non-genomic) at the specific ionic strengths in the medium.</p></sec><sec id="s6" hwp:id="sec-26"><title hwp:id="title-29">Conclusions</title><p hwp:id="p-48">Self-assembling properties of virus capsid proteins is a realistic and attractive material. The virus capsid proteins can advance the development of fabricating a robust nanotools for the nanotechnology application. Hence, we began to manipulate one of the well-known destructive plant pathogenic viruses – <italic toggle="yes">Squash leaf curl China virus</italic> (SLCCNV) – towards self-assembled “Nanocargo”-like virus structures. In this experiment, <italic toggle="yes">Pichia</italic> expressed SLCCNV-CP showed a high affinity towards pH along with calcium ions, which spontaneously facilitated the reformation of monomers to constraint “Nanocargo”-like structures. The resultant SLCCNV-CP-Nanocargo’s are stable under a pH similar to physiologic pH, and it can be disassemble simply by changing the pH to acidic. Using this pH-responsive assembly/disassembly mechanism, the magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were successfully entrapped into “SLCCNV-CP-Nanocargo” materials. This pH-responsive gating mechanism is a feasible way to accommodate various kinds of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules within the “SLCCNV-CP-Nanocargo”, which will address them as a next generation nanotool with promising biomedical applications. In fact, pH-responsive materials are in demand in the area of target therapeutic delivery [83]. For example, this type of pH-responsive reversible materials allows triggered release of therapeutic materials to an acidic environment at the tumour site [84]. Moreover, through a bioinformatics study, we sufficiently gained some realistic information about coat protein assembly, which correlates highly with the results obtained from <italic toggle="yes">the in vitro</italic> experiment. Also, another phase of <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> analysis deciphered the potential bioconjugation sites available in the SLCCNV-CP which could be work favourably to tether any functional moiety to deliver at the tissue target site. Significantly, it was proved that “SLCCNV-CP-Nanocargo” has no cytotoxic effects in maximum concentrations to mammalian cancer cell lines which can manifest “SLCCNV-CP-Nanocargo” as a potential biocompatibility material. Even though there are hundreds of virus-like particles studied, our extensive studies of the self-assembly of SLCCNV-coat protein show unique features which are very new to viral nanotechnology and which will also throw much light on smart delivery vehicle research in the biomedical field.</p></sec></body></article>
