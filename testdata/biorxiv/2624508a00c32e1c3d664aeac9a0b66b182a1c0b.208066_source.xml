Nevertheless, while mutagens, replication machinery, and repair processes exhibit identifiable mutation signatures, at the tissue or organismal scale the aggregate somatic manifestation of these processes has been difficult to measure, and often appears to be semi-random. This randomness is often believed to contribute to the stochasticity of diseases like cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup> and physiological decline during aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>. The challenge in observing any tissue-wide somatic mutation patterns is that prior to clonal expansion, most mutations are rare in healthy tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref></sup>. Here we describe a new method called FERMI (Fast Extremely Rare Mutation Identification), which comprehensively captures and quantifies rare mutations at single DNA molecule resolution that exist at frequencies as rare as 10′<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup> in human peripheral blood. Using this method, we observed an unanticipated degree of ubiquity and similarity between the somatic mutation loads of different individuals, where most assayed substitutions are found to occur at conserved frequencies across nearly all individuals spanning a nine decade age range. These observed mutational patterns existed both within within non-conserved, non-coding and non-repetitive regions of the genome and within the coding regions of oncogenes implicated in hematopoietic malignancies. Furthermore, we find that nucleotides preferentially mutate to particular bases in a manner that is specified by nucleotide identity, position, and sequence context. Finally, we identify individuals who deviate from typical mutational patterns in a reproducible manner that resembles a mild mismatch repair deficiency, suggesting that variation in somatic mutation rates may be relatively common. This study provides one of the first estimates of mutation burden in terminally differentiated somatic cells and demonstrates that somatic mutations in such cells are significantly more frequent and deterministic than previously believed, and are governed by mechanisms that when perturbed, result in predictable outcomes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="49"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

To overcome these sequencing limitations, we created FERMI, in which we adapted the amplicon sequencing method of Illumina’s TrueSeq Custom Amplicon platform to target only 32 × 150bp genomic regions, spanning AML-associated oncogenic mutations and the Tier III regions of the human genome (non-conserved, non-protein coding and non-repetitive). We further improved upon Illumina’s capture efficiency to achieve approximately 1.2 million unique captures from 500ng-1μg of genomic DNA (gDNA) (See Methods). The targeting probes used in gDNA capture were designed with 16bp index of sequence unique to each individual and a 12bp unique molecular identifier (UMI) of random DNA, ideally unique to each capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Sequencing reads were sorted both by sample index and UMI, producing bins of single cell sequencing which were collapsed to produce relatively error-free consensus reads. Captures were only considered if supported by at least 5 reads, and variants were only included if identified in both paired-end sequences, and detected in at least 55% percent of supporting reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and Methods; see also Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-1" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4 xref-fig-1-5 xref-fig-1-6 xref-fig-1-7 xref-fig-1-8 xref-fig-1-9 xref-fig-1-10 xref-fig-1-11"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;208066v1/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Amplicon sequencing accurately detects mutation allele frequencies as rare as 1/10,000.</title><p hwp:id="p-4"><bold>a</bold>, Graphical depiction of gDNA capture and analysis method. <bold>b</bold>, Capture efficiencies vary in a probe dependent manner. <bold>c</bold>, Accurate detection of a single heterozygous SNP in gDNA from one individual diluted into gDNA from another (without this germline SNP) to frequencies as low as 1/10,000. <bold>d</bold>, Accurate detection of three linked SNPs found within the same allele diluted as in c.

To understand assay sensitivity, log-series dilutions of human heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were prepared and assayed by FERMI. Using these dilutions, we observed robust quantification of diluted SNPs as rare as 10<sup>−4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-4" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Even more accurate quantifications of SNP frequency can be made when using strand information to follow dilutions of multiple SNPs located on the same allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-5" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).

Surprisingly, within each of the probed regions, nearly every position is mutated in at least one individual, including all probed oncogenic mutations, independent of segment location or individual age, indicating a mutation rate of greater than 50 per megabase (See Estimation of mutation rate in Methods). While FERMI could correctly identify individual-specific unique germline SNPs (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-1" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 2a</xref>), rare somatic variants are found at remarkably similar allele frequencies across all sampled ages. The rare allele frequencies are similar enough between most individuals that comparisons of the variant allele frequencies for each unique substitution falls along a y=x line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). FERMI of biopsies taken 1 month apart from the same individuals reveal the same germline SNPs (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-2" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 2b</xref>), but detected rare variants are not significantly more similar to each other than to other individuals (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-3" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 2c</xref>). Variant allele frequencies (VAFs) were averaged across 22 sampled individuals and used as a comparison to individuals, which appear age-independent and still adhere to a y=x line (R<sup>2</sup> Range = 0.426-0.631, Mean = 0.558) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-2" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), and are similar across experiments (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-1" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 3a-d</xref> shows data from an additional 11 individuals). Variants with frequencies above 0.001 were found in nearly all samples, while more rare variants were missed with a probability inversely proportional to their allele frequencies. Furthermore, most variants likely represent multiple independent events rather than clonal expansions, as they are found at similar frequencies on both alleles (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-2" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 3e</xref>). It thus appears that instead of being semi-random, the aggregate effect of all DNA damage and maintenance generates somatic mutations at predictable rates throughout the genome independent of age. We suspect that such mutations primarily arise in terminally differentiated blood cell types in a sequence context-dependent manner, without constraints imposed by developmental lineages and selection, such that it reflects the basal DNA damage and repair errors in hematopoietic cells.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">We observed that the overall probability of a substitution occurring is biased by nucleotide identity, with C&gt;T substitutions being the most common and T&gt;G substitutions being the least common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-3" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).

Regardless of functional or oncogenic potential, each site tends to undergo the same substitutions across individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-5" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). These conserved substitution rates appear to be deterministic, and cannot be explained by undersampling (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-1" hwp:rel-id="F7">Figure 4</xref>) or known base change biases (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-1" hwp:rel-id="F8">Figure 5</xref>).

Our use of these samples was determined to be “Not Human Subjects” by our Institutional Review Board. Biopsies were collected as unfractionated whole blood from apparently healthy donors, though samples were not tested for infection. Samples were approximately 10 mL in volume, and collected in BD Vacutainer spray-coated EDTA tubes. Following collection, samples were stored at 4°C until processing, which occurred within 5 hours of donation. To remove plasma from the blood, samples were put in 50 mL conical tubes (Corning #430828) and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 515 rcf. Following centrifugation, plasma was aspirated and 200 mL of 4°C hemolytic buffer (8.3g NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 1.0g NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.04 Na<sub>2</sub> in 1L ddH<sub>2</sub>O) was added to the samples and incubated at 4°C for 10 minutes. Hemolyzed cells were centrifuged at 515 rcf for 10 minutes, supernatant was aspirated, and pellet was washed with 200 mL of 4°C PBS.

DNA was quantified with a NanoDrop 2000c (ThermoFisher Catalog #ND-2000C). 500ng of input DNA in 15μl was used for each reaction instead of the recommended quantities. In place of 5μl of Illumina ‘CAT’ amplicons, 5μl of 4500ng/μl of our amplicons were used. During the hybridization reaction, after gDNA and amplicon reaction mixture was prepared, sealed, and centrifuged as instructed, gDNA was melted for 10 minutes at 95°C in a heat block (SciGene Hybex Microsample Incubator Catalog #1057-30-O). Heat block temperature was then set to 60°C, allowed to passively cool from 95°C and incubated for 24hr. Following incubation, the heat block was set to 40°C and allowed to passively cool for 1hr. The extension-ligation reaction was prepared using 90 μl of ELM4 master mix per sample and incubated at 37°C for 24hr. PCR amplification was performed at recommended temperatures and times for 29 cycles. Successful amplification was confirmed immediately following PCR amplification using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Genomics 2200 Tapestation Catalog #G2964-90002, High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape Catalog #5067-5584, High Sensitivity D1000 Reagents Catalog #5067-5585).

For a detailed understanding of each function provided by the analysis pipeline, refer directly to the software. The overall goal of the software built for this project is to analyze amplicon captured DNA that is tagged with equal length UMIs on the 5’ and 3’ ends of captures, and has been paired-end sequenced using dual indexes. Input fastq files are either automatically or manually combined with their paired-end sequencing partners into a single fastq file. Paired reads are combined by eliminating any base that does not match between Read1 and Read2, and concatenating this consensus read with the 5’ and 3’ UMIs. A barcode is then created for each consensus read from the 5’ and 3’ UMIs and the first five bases at the 5’ end of the consensus. All consensus sequences are then binned together by their unique barcodes. The threshold for barcode mismatch can be specified when running the software, and for all data shown in this manuscript one mismatched base was allowed for a sequence to still count as the same barcode. Bins are then collapsed into a single consensus read by first removing the 5’ and 3’ UMIs. Following UMI removal, consensus sequences are derived by incorporating the most commonly observed nucleotide at each position so long as the same nucleotide is observed in at least a specified percent of supporting reads (55% of reads was used for results in this manuscript) and there are least some minimum number of reads supporting a capture (5 supporting reads was used for results in this manuscript). Any nucleotide that does not meet the minimum threshold for read support is not added to the consensus read, and alignment is attempted with an unknown base at that position. From this set of consensus reads, experimental quality measurements are made, such as total captures, total sequencing reads, average capture coverage, and estimated error rates. Derived consensus reads are then aligned to the specified reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref></sup>, and indexed using SAMtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref></sup>.

Variants are then filtered to eliminate any that have been identified outside of probed genomic regions. If necessary variants can also be eliminated if below certain coverage or observation thresholds such that variants must be independently observed multiple times in different captures to be included.

Nevertheless, we have a number of steps that should eliminate most sources of false signal. The two largest sources of erroneous mutation when sequencing DNA will typically be from PCR amplification mutations (caused both by polymerase errors and exogenous insults like oxidative damage), and sequencing errors.</p><p hwp:id="p-21">The steps are the following:

Since there is little difference between those mutations that occur during the first round of PCR amplification and those that occurred endogenously, we rely on probability to eliminate these errors. Since we are performing single-cell sequencing, we can require that a mutation be observed in multiple cells before it is called as a true positive signal. As we expect about 400 first round PCR amplification errors, the probability that the identical mutation will occur in multiple cells becomes exponentially unlikely (Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-3" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure 1</xref>). By requiring a mutation be observed in just three cells before it is called as real signal, only about 1-2 first round PCR amplification errors should ever make it into the final data. When we process our data requiring up to 5 independent observations of a mutation, the overall mutation spectrum does not change, apart from a loss of the most rarely observed variants. This observation led us to include all variants that were observed even once. Our logic is that while about 400 variants will be the result of the first round of PCR amplification, these same variants are already occurring endogenously, meaning that absolution variant allele frequency accuracy will be affected, but not the identities of variants.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2" hwp:id="sec-10"><title hwp:id="title-15">Elimination of subsequent PCR amplification errors</title><p hwp:id="p-26">Elimination of PCR amplification errors after the first round of PCR is done using UMI collapsing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-7" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Each time a strand is amplified, the UMI will keep track of its identity. Any mutations that occur after the first round of PCR will be found in 25% of the reads or fewer. This allows us to collapse each unique capture and eliminate any rarely observed variants associated with a given UMI. Utilizing the UMI in this way allows us to essentially eliminate any PCR amplification errors that occurred after the first round of PCR.</p></sec><sec id="s2f3" hwp:id="sec-11"><title hwp:id="title-16">Elimination of sequencing errors</title><p hwp:id="p-27">Sequencing errors are eliminated in two ways.

The information found within each of these reads (Read1 and Read2) should theoretically be the same, meaning that unless the same sequencing error is made at the same locus within both Read1 and Read2, the two strands will differ. Any differences are simply eliminated from the data as it is unknown which base call is correct, and the rest of the data is included in the analysis. This collapsing should eliminate most sequencing errors, though it will sequencing errors of the same identity occurring at the same locus.

So estimating a somatic mutation rate is challenging. Nevertheless we can estimate what somatic mutation rates might be assuming the number of cells that were assayed contained all unique variants or not.</p><p hwp:id="p-30">An upper bound for the somatic mutation rate observed by FERMI analysis can be estimated by using the number of captures and total observed variants, and assume that all of these are de-novo mutations. In our data we observe about 1232458 unique captures per analyzed blood sample. These captures are relatively uniformly spread across each of our 32 different probes which span a total of 4838bp. From this the total probed DNA, D<sub>T</sub>, can be estimated as:

</disp-formula></p><p hwp:id="p-32">A lower estimate can be made by assuming that mutations are not all unique occurrences but might be the result of clonal expansions creating many copies of each mutation. This mutation rate, M, can be roughly estimated by the approximately 40000 captures per each of the 32 probes that captured roughly 6000 variants across a conservative 100bp sized capture for each probe (probe region is realistically smaller than 150bp because of collapsing conditions).

We performed paired-end collapsing prior to consensus read derivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-10" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), though the effect was surprisingly mild. In this table, the number of identified variants are shown when duplex collapsing is used or not in consensus read derivation (mock duplexing processes the collapsing in the exact same way as duplex collapsing without eliminating variants for not being in both reads). These variant counts are shown while also varying the number of required independent supporting captures for a variant to pass filtering. The logic behind this analysis is that the fewer captures in which a variant is found, the less confidence we have that it represents true biological signal. Lower confidence variants should be more likely to be eliminated by duplex collapsing reads, if other filters were otherwise insufficient. We show that whether reads are first duplex collapsed or not, there is little effect on the percent of variants that are eliminated, suggesting that our other filtering parameters appear to adequately eliminate sequencing errors. <bold>b</bold>, While the filters used for FERMI should eliminate the majority of errors introduced during PCR amplification and those errors arising from sequencing mistakes, errors made in the first round of PCR amplification could be identified as false positives. If there is a sufficient number of PCR errors made within the first round of amplification, these errors could create artificial patterns within the data. Using one supporting capture as the lower limit for variants to be identified as true signal, the expected number of errors were estimated from amplification using Phusion polymerase and are shown in the table (two estimations are included because Illumina’s reaction mixtures are proprietary and we do not know the exact reaction conditions). <bold>c</bold>, When only requiring one supporting capture, 3-6% of variants should be derived from first round PCR errors, although more than half of these will be eliminated by the requirement that 55% of reads for a capture support the variant (errors from subsequent PCR rounds will be even more efficiently eliminated by the 55% cutoff). If we require that the same variant be present at the same location across multiple captures before it is included in the final results, it becomes exponentially more unlikely that a first round PCR error would get included. In contrast, increased capture number requirements have a much more modest effect on variants called. <bold>d</bold>, While increasing the number of required supporting captures eliminates rare variants as well as first round PCR errors, the numbers of identified variants only decreases modestly for all individuals (blue line, left y-axis). In contrast, the number of variants expected to be identified as a result of first round PCR amplification errors exponentially decreases with each extra capture requirement (red line, right y-axis). When compared to the number of variants that pass all filters and processing, the first round PCR errors appear to have minimal effect even when only a single capture is required. Expectedly, as we increase the number of required captures supporting a variant, the total number of variants also decreases, and after two required captures should essentially not include mutations created by PCR amplification. Throughout most of this paper, a single capture is used, so as to not bias results by variant representation. Nonetheless, the patterns of mutations identified look very similar when greater numbers of supporting captures are required. <bold>e</bold>, As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-11" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, when deriving consensus reads, variants are eliminated for being rarely observed across reads supporting a given capture. The cutoff we use throughout most of this manuscript is 55%, such that a given variant must be present in at least 55 percent of sequencing reads supporting a capture or they are ignored. The logic behind this chosen cutoff is that more stringent cutoffs largely do not alter the observed mutation spectra, but result in a significant loss in putatively true positive signal. With this cutoff, the expected number of sequencing errors can be estimated. We observe that 9 percent of bases are mismatched within reads supporting a given capture. Each capture is approximately 150bp in length and is supported by an average 13.5 reads. This yields an average of 182.25 errors within each sequenced capture.

</disp-formula></p><p hwp:id="p-35">The number of expected PCR amplification errors to pass all cutoffs is then estimated using a Gaussian distribution. The logic is that the first round of PCR amplification will create errors that will be at an allele frequency near 50 percent as an error will be created in one of two strands of a captured sequence. Using a Gaussian distribution with a mean at 50, the number of all PCR amplification errors expected to pass the 1 supporting capture and 55-95 percent of sequencing reads criteria can be calculated by integrating under the Gaussian distribution. Since we expected about 405 first round PCR amplification errors, and subsequent errors will exist at much smaller allele frequencies, the expected number of variants expected to pass criteria is calculated as follows:

The logic behind this analysis is that if independently captured variants result from the same original event (i.e. a clone), then these variants should be found on the same allele. Alternatively, if variants result from independent events, then such variants should be frequently found on both alleles. By following linkage between variants and heterozygous SNPs, the two alleles can be distinguished. Shown here are the allele frequencies of variants found on either Allele 1 along the x-axis or Allele 2 along the y-axis (analyses are restricted to genomic segments from individuals containing heterozygous SNPs). As the variants adhere to a y=x line, they appear randomly distributed between both alleles, suggesting that variants detected represent multiple independent events rather than clonal expansions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="208066_figS3" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-16"/></fig><fig id="figS4" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F7" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-7-1 xref-fig-7-2 xref-fig-7-3 xref-fig-7-4 xref-fig-7-5 xref-fig-7-6 xref-fig-7-7"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;208066v1/FIGS4</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F7</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">figS4</object-id><label>Extended Data Figure 4:</label><caption hwp:id="caption-8"><title hwp:id="title-23">Triplet prevalence in probed regions does not sufficiently explain base bias.</title><p hwp:id="p-40">To understand how representative our total captured region was of the overall human genome, the trinucleotide sequence counts <bold>a</bold>, found within our 32 probes was compared to <bold>b</bold>, the overall trinucleotide counts found within hg19.

To understand the likelihood of this pattern arising due to random chance, every instance of a given substitution was quantified for each probed site across all individuals. These changes were used to derive an overall probability that each base would change to any of the other 3 bases if mutated. Using a chi-squared algorithm to test goodness of fit, individual probabilities were computed for the base substitution pattern observed at each base locus. These probabilities were then multi-comparison corrected using Bonferroni correction, separated by reference base, ordered in descending order, and plotted here. When a variant was only observed in a small number of individuals, the probability of this change exclusively occurring at a given location due to chance was relatively high, resulting in a substantial number of non-significant loci (<bold>a-d</bold>; p values ~1). Plotting only positions exhibiting significant bias reveals a substantial number of bases that predictably mutate across individuals in a manner unlikely to be explained by chance (<bold>e-h</bold>; p values that approach zero lack bars). The total number of variants passing significance for each base are: A) 27 C) 23 G) 51 T) 44.
