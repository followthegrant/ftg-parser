The idea was to provide crucial clues to aid the design of inhibitors, which would be able to bind the protease well by making favorable interactions with important residues of the enzyme. The analyses dictated placement of ligands towards the front of the enzymatic cleft, and disfavored interactions deep within. The S1’ and S2 subsites of the enzyme preferred to remain occupied by polar ligand subgroups. Reasonably distanced ring systems and polar backbones of ligands were desired across the cleft. Large as well as inflexible subgroups were not tolerated. Double ringed systems such as substituted napthalene, especially in S1, were exceptions though. The S2 subsite, which is typically a specificity determinant in papain (C1) family cysteine proteases such as cathepsin L-like cryptopain-1, can possibly accommodate polar and hydrophobic ligand subgroups alike.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Keywords</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">Vinyl sulfone inhibitors</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">Cryptopain-1</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">Cysteine protease</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">Molecular modeling</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">Covalent docking</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-6"><italic toggle="yes">In-silico</italic> mutational analysis</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-7">Drug design</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="30"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta hwp:id="custom-meta-1"><meta-name>special-property</meta-name><meta-value>contains-inline-supplementary-material</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta-wrap>

The outputs of the calculations were displayed in several columns. dGwt column had the dG (Gibbs free energy) value for the wild type complex (without mutation), the dGmut held the dG value for the mutated complex (where the residue was mutated to Ala), and the ddGbind (dGmut – dGwt) column, which showed the binding free energy change (in Kcal/mol) upon mutation, essentially predicted the stability of the native complex, thereby hinting at the contribution of the residue in question towards binding the ligand. Positive values of ddGbind implied the mutation to be less favorable, indicating greater contribution of the wild type residue towards binding. Hence, with more positive ddGbind, better binding of the ligand by the residue could be expected.

However, large (polar) halide-substituted rings such as bromopyridine could lead to clashes.

Unfavorable interactions for the residue were observed with the close proximity of ligands’ polar substituents or backbone.

The interactions were better with more number of rings. The highest ddGbind value was obtained for the compound that had four ring systems. However close interactions either with the ligand backbone or side chain resulted in unfavorable interactions. Inflexible groups such as diazospiro, even if placed away from the residue, amounted to negative ddGbind values.</p><p hwp:id="p-58">Taken together, inflexible groups such as diazospiro, ethenyl etc. would not be tolerated by S1. The subsite can accommodate multiple ring systems. The mid-pocket would have a preference towards polar backbone of ligands that are positioned towards the front.

Unlike K11777, the other compounds showed optimal interactions mostly with the prime site residues of the enzyme. The S1’ residues made half of the frequently contacted favorable interactions with the ligands. The rest half of such interactions were accounted by S1 and S2 members.</p><p hwp:id="p-66">With respect to the entire enzymatic cleft of cryptopain-1, it can be deduced that the ligands’ placement towards the front of the cleft would be preferred to deep-seated interactions. Polar backbones of ligands (even if not peptidyl) would be desired. S1’ and S2 like to be occupied, and are prone to make favorable interactions with polar subgroups of ligands. Large halide-containing subgroups are not well tolerated presumably because of their size. Reasonably distanced ring interactions would be preferred all across the cleft. Unlike inflexible groups like substituted napthalene which could be favorably accommodated in S1, the strain arising out of the inflexibility of ethenyl and/or diazospiro groups is not likely to be tolerated, especially in the S1’ and S1 subsites, as per the computational mutational analysis.</p><p hwp:id="p-67">Quite relevantly, the compound 23520342 that showed the maximum number of favorable interactions with the frequently contacted residues, (see <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-2-2" hwp:rel-id="T2">Table 2</xref></bold>) had all the preferred attributes and lacked the undesirable ones.

The ligands’ polar backbones, in addition to the occupation of the enzymatic S1’ site with polar subgroups, somewhat mitigated the unfavorable interactions in totality. The compounds also had the undesirable ethenyl near S1’, which contributed to unfavorable interactions with K19 in case of 5279261 (where the ethenyl was placed much closer to the residue). However, the overall scoring algorithm did not penalize ethenyl’s presence as much as the individual ddGbind calculations did.</p><p hwp:id="p-70">5279269, which showed the best score, too had an ethenyl group (albeit not close to K19). This compound however was placed towards the front of the cleft, thereby avoiding unfavorable interactions with C24. Also, the ligand had ring systems in abundance (six) for favorable interactions.

Unlike the other two mentioned compounds (11303991 and 5279261), the subgroups of the model ligands extended into S2 – typically the key specificity determinant in cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases such as cryptopain-1. 23520342 placed a polar subgroup at S2 in contrast to the hydrophobic subgroup put by 5279269. Polar ligand subgroups (as in 23520342) at the enzyme’s S2 are likely to be stabilized via polar/electrostatic interactions by residues like T69, M70, T160, K161 and E215. Hydrophobic subgroups too (as in 5279269) could be accommodated by the virtue of S2 residues like A138 and V162.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F5" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-5-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;332965v6/FIG5</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F5</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig5</object-id><label>Figure 5:</label><caption hwp:id="caption-7"><p hwp:id="p-73">The chemical structures (along with the PubChem identifiers) of the reference ligand K11777 or K-777, and the two model compounds - which showed optimum interactions with the enzymatic cleft of cryptopain-1 and thereby could aid the design of effective inhibitors to target the protease.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="332965v6_fig5" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-16"/></fig><p hwp:id="p-74">Thus, the study attempted to identify purchasable vinyl sulfone compounds that can possibly inhibit cryptopain-1, as well as it provided crucial information pertaining to receptor-ligand interactions to help future design of other vinyl sulfones, which could prove to be effective in curbing cryptosporidiosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" hwp:id="sec-18"><title hwp:id="title-22">Supporting information</title><supplementary-material position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="DC1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">DC1</object-id><label>supplementary tables</label><media xlink:href="supplements/332965_file04.xls" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="media-1"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="DC2"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">DC2</object-id><label>supplementary figures</label><media xlink:href="supplements/332965_file05.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="media-2"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-23">Acknowledgement</title><p hwp:id="p-75">The author would like to thank Prof. Ruben Abagyan of University of California San Diego, for providing computational resources.</p></ack><ref-list hwp:id="ref-list-1"><title hwp:id="title-24">REFERENCES</title><ref id="c1" hwp:id="ref-1" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-1-1"><label>[1]</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="332965v6.1" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-1"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="DuPont HL"><surname>DuPont</surname> <given-names>HL</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Chappell CL"><surname>Chappell</surname> <given-names>CL</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Sterling CR"><surname>Sterling</surname> <given-names>CR</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Okhuysen PC"><surname>Okhuysen</surname> <given-names>PC</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Rose JB"><surname>Rose</surname> <given-names>JB</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Jakubowski W."><surname>Jakubowski</surname> <given-names>W.</given-names></string-name> <year>1995</year>. <article-title hwp:id="article-title-2">The infectivity of Cryptosporidium parvum in healthy volunteers</article-title>. <source hwp:id="source-1">N.
