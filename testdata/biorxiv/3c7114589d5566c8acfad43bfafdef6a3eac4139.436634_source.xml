Here we present RegTools (<ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="https://www.regtools.org" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.regtools.org" hwp:id="ext-link-2">www.regtools.org</ext-link>), a free, open-source software package designed to integrate analysis of somatic variants from genomic data with splice junctions from transcriptomic data to identify variants that may cause aberrant splicing. RegTools was applied to over 9,000 tumor samples with both tumor DNA and RNA sequence data. We discovered 235,778 events where a variant significantly increased the splicing of a particular junction, across 158,200 unique variants and 131,212 unique junctions. To characterize these somatic variants and their associated splice isoforms, we annotated them with the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), SpliceAI, and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) junction counts and compared our results to other tools that integrate genomic and transcriptomic data. While certain events can be identified by the aforementioned tools, the unbiased nature of RegTools has allowed us to identify novel splice variants and previously unreported patterns of splicing disruption in known cancer drivers, such as <italic toggle="yes">TP53, CDKN2A</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">B2M</italic>, as well as in genes not previously considered cancer-relevant, such as <italic toggle="yes">RNF145</italic>.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="48"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

However, splicing malfunction can lead to imbalances in transcriptional output or even the presence of novel oncogenic transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref></sup>. The interpretation of variants in cancer is frequently focused on direct protein-coding alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup>. However, most somatic mutations arise in intronic and intergenic regions, and exonic mutations may also have unidentified regulatory consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup>. For example, mutations can affect splicing either in trans, by acting on splicing effectors, or in cis, by altering the splicing signals located on the transcripts themselves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">Increasingly, we are identifying the importance of splice variants in disease processes, including in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref></sup>. However, our understanding of the landscape of these variants is currently limited, and few tools exist for their discovery. One approach to elucidating the role of splice variants has been to predict the strength of putative splice sites in pre-mRNA from genomic sequences, such as the method used by the SpliceAI tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup>. With the advent of efficient and affordable RNA-seq, we are also seeing the complementary approach of evaluating alternative splicing events (ASEs) directly from RNA sequencing data. Various tools exist which allow the identification of significant ASEs from transcript-level data within sample cohorts, including SUPPA2 and SPLADDER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref></sup>. Many of these tools have also evaluated the role of trans-acting splice mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref></sup>. However, few tools are directed at linking specific aberrant RNA splicing events to specific genomic variants in cis to investigate the splice regulatory impact of these variants. Those few relevant tools that do exist have significant limitations that preclude them from broad applications. The sQTL-based approach taken by LeafCutter and other tools is designed for relatively frequent single-nucleotide polymorphisms. It is thus ill-suited to studying somatic variants, or any case in which the frequency of a particular variant is very low (often unique) in a given sample population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref></sup>. Recent tools that have been created for large-scale analysis of cancer-specific data, such as MiSplice and Veridical, ignore certain types of ASEs, are tailored to specific analysis strategies and sets of hypotheses, or are otherwise inaccessible to the end-user due to issues such as lack of documentation, difficulty with installation and integration with existing pipelines, limited computing efficiency, or licensing issues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref></sup>. To address these needs, we have developed RegTools, a free, open-source (MIT license) software package that is well-documented, modularized for ease of use, and designed to efficiently identify potential cis-acting splice-relevant variants in tumors (<ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="https://www.regtools.org" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.regtools.org" hwp:id="ext-link-3">www.regtools.org</ext-link>).</p><p hwp:id="p-7">RegTools is a suite of tools designed to aid users in a broad range of splicing-related analyses. At the highest level, it contains three sub-modules: a variants module to annotate variant calls with respect to their potential splicing relevance, a junctions module to analyze aligned RNA-seq data and associated splicing events, and a cis-splice-effects module that integrates genomic variant calls and transcriptomic sequencing data to identify potential splice-altering variants. Each sub-module contains one or more commands, which can be used individually or integrated into regulatory variant analysis pipelines.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">To demonstrate the utility of RegTools in identifying potential splice-relevant variants from tumor data, we analyzed a combination of data available from the McDonnell Genome Institute (MGI) at Washington University School of Medicine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. In total, we applied RegTools to 9,173 samples across 35 cancer types. We contrasted our results with other tools that integrate genomic and transcriptomic data to identify potential splice altering variants, specifically Veridical, MiSplice, and SAVNet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref></sup>.

The variants module contains the annotate command. The <italic toggle="yes">variants annotate</italic> command takes a VCF of somatic variant calls and a GTF of transcriptome annotations as input. RegTools does not have any particular preference for variant callers or reference annotations. Each variant is annotated by RegTools with known overlapping genes and transcripts, and is categorized into one of several user-configurable “variant types”, based on position relative to the edges of known exons. The variant type annotation depends on the stringency for splicing-relevance that the user sets with the “splice variant window” setting. By default, RegTools marks intronic variants within 2 bp of the exon edge as “splicing intronic”, exonic variants within 3 bp as “splicing exonic”, other intronic variants as “intronic”, and other exonic variants simply as “exonic.” RegTools considers only “splicing intronic” and “splicing exonic” as important. To allow for discovery of an arbitrarily expansive set of variants, RegTools allows the user to customize the size of the exonic/intronic windows individually (e.g. −i 50 -e 5 for intronic variants 50 bp from an exon edge and exonic variants 5 bp from an exon edge) or even consider all exonic/intronic variants as potentially splicing-relevant (e.g. -E or -I) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1A</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;436634v4/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Figure 1:</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><title hwp:id="title-6">Flexible, streamlined discovery of cis-acting splice variants with RegTools modules and <italic toggle="yes">cis-splice-effects identify workflow</italic>.</title><p hwp:id="p-10"><bold>A)</bold> By default, <italic toggle="yes">variants annotate</italic> marks variants within 3bp on the exonic side and 2bp on the intronic side of an exon edge as potentially splicing-relevant.

Comparing the observed junctions to the reference junctions in the first transcript (top panel), RegTools checks to see if the observed donor and acceptor splice sites are found in any of the reference exons and also counts the number of exons, acceptors, and donors skipped by a particular junction. Double arrows represent matches between observed and reference acceptor/donor sites while single arrows show novel splice sites. These steps are repeated for the rest of the relevant transcripts, keeping track of whether there are known acceptor-donor combinations. Junctions with a known donor but novel acceptor or vice-versa are annotated as “D” or “A”, respectively.

Cohort sizes ranged from 21 to 1,022 samples. In total, 6,370,631 variants (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2A</xref></bold>) and 2,387,989,201 junction observations (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-2" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2B</xref></bold>) were analyzed by RegTools. By comparing the number of initial variants per cohort to the number of statistically significant variants, we were able to show that RegTools produces a prioritized list of potential splice relevant variants <bold>(<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-1" hwp:rel-id="F8">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>)</bold>. Additionally, when analyzing the junctions within each sample, we found that junctions present in the reference transcriptome are frequently seen within GTEx data while junctions observed from a sample’s own transcriptome data that were not present in the reference are rarely seen within GTEx <bold>(<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-9-1" hwp:rel-id="F9">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>)</bold>. 235,778 significant variant junction pairings were found for junctions that use a known donor and novel acceptor (D), novel donor and known acceptor (A), or novel combination of a known donor and a known acceptor (NDA), with novel here meaning that the junction was not found in the reference transcriptome (<bold>Methods, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-3" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, Supplemental Files 1 and 2</bold>). While our analysis primarily focuses on variants in relation to novel splice events because of the potential importance of these events within tumor processes, we also wanted to assess how often a variant was significantly associated with a known junction. 5,157 variant junction pairings were found for junctions known to the reference (DA junctions) (<bold>Supplemental Files 3 and 4</bold>). This finding indicates that while splice variants usually result in a novel junction occurring, they sometimes alter the expression of known junctions. Generally, significant events were evenly split among each of the novel junction types considered (D, A, and NDA). The number of significant events increased as the splice variant window size increased, with both the E and I results being comparable in number. Notably, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was the only cohort that had whole genome sequencing (WGS) data available and, as expected, it exhibited a marked increase in the number of significant events for its results within the “I” splice variant window. This observation highlights the low sequence coverage of intronic regions that occurs with WES which subsequently leads to underpowered discovery of potential splice altering variants within introns.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F2" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-2-1 xref-fig-2-2 xref-fig-2-3"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;436634v4/FIG2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig2</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-2"><title hwp:id="title-8">Overview of input data considered and significant events identified by RegTools for each tumor type.</title><p hwp:id="p-16"><bold>A)</bold> Summary of initial variants considered for analysis by RegTools per sample per tumor cohort.

While a single variant resulting in a single novel junction is most commonly observed (72.27-83.78%), a single variant also commonly results in multiple junctions being created, either of the same type (6.56-10.94%) or of different types (9.66-16.79%) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-2" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). Variants that are associated with multiple novel junctions of different types were further investigated to identify how often a particular junction type occurred with another (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). Most commonly, we observed an alternate donor or acceptor site being used in conjunction with an exon skipping event. These events were particularly common within the default window (2 intronic bases or 3 exonic bases from the exon edge), as a SNV or indel within these positions has a high probability of disrupting the natural splice site, thus causing the splicing machinery to use a cryptic splice site nearby or skip the splice site entirely. The next most common event was an alternate donor site and an alternate acceptor site both being used as the result of a single variant. The combination of a novel acceptor site and novel donor site being used in conjunction with an exon-skipping event occurred the least and occurrence of this type of event remains fairly low, even as the search space increases within the larger splice variant windows. This finding indicates the low likelihood of a single variant resulting in simultaneous disruption of a splice acceptor and donor as well as complete skipping of an exon. Overall, this analysis highlights that there is evidence that a single variant can lead to multiple novel junctions being expressed. Tools that only allow for a single junction to be predicted or associated with a variant therefore may not be completely describing the effect of the variant in question in up to ∼27% of cases.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F3" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-3-1 xref-fig-3-2 xref-fig-3-3"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;436634v4/FIG3</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F3</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig3</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-3"><title hwp:id="title-9">Splice regulatory variants often lead to the expression of multiple alternative junctions.</title><p hwp:id="p-18"><bold>A)</bold> A single variant can result in either one or more than one alternatively spliced junctions.

Both VEP and SpliceAI only consider information about the variant and its genomic sequence context and do not consider information from a sample’s transcriptome. A variant is considered to be splice relevant according to VEP if it occurs within 1-3 bases on the exonic side or 1-8 bases on the intronic side of a splice site. SpliceAI does not have restrictions on where the variant can occur in relation to the splice site but by default, it predicts one new donor and acceptor site within 50 bp of the variant, based on reference transcript sequences from GENCODE. Like RegTools, SAVNet, MiSplice, and Veridical integrate genomic and transcriptomic data in order to identify splice altering variants. MiSplice only considers junctions that occur within 20 bp of the variant. Additionally, SAVNet, MiSplice, and Veridical filter out any transcripts found within the reference transcriptome. SAVNet, MiSplice, and Veridical employ different statistical methods for the identification of splice altering variants. In contrast to RegTools, none of the mentioned tools allow the user to set a custom window in which they wish to focus splice altering variant discovery (e.g. around the splice site, all exonic variants, etc.). These tools have different levels of code availability. MiSplice is available via GitHub as a collection of Perl scripts that are built to run via Load Sharing Facility (LSF) job scheduling. To run MiSplice without an LSF cluster, the authors mention code changes are required. Veridical is available via a subscription through CytoGnomix’s MutationForecaster.

Only 343 variants are identified as splice altering by all six tools. Comparatively, MiSplice and SAVNet find few splice altering variants, potentially indicating that these tools are overlooking the complete set of variants that have an effect on splicing. In contrast, Veridical identifies by far the most splice altering variants across all tools, with 94.54 percent of its calls being found by it alone. SpliceAI and VEP called a large number of variants, either alone or in agreement, that none of the tools that integrate transcriptomic data from samples identify. This highlights a limitation of using tools that only focus on genomic data, particularly in a disease context where transcripts are unlikely to have been annotated before. RegTools addresses these short-comings by identifying what pieces of information to extract from a sample’s genome and transcriptome in a very basic, unbiased way that allows for generalization. Other tools either only analyze genomic data, focus on junctions where either the canonical donor or acceptor site is affected (missing junctions that result from complete exon skipping), or consider only those variants within a very narrow distance from known splice sites. RegTools can include any kind of junction type, including exon-exon junctions that have ends that are not known donor/acceptor sites according to the GTF file (N junction according to RegTools), any distance size to make variant-junction associations, and any window size in which to consider variants.

As such, we further analyzed significant events to identify genes that had recurrent splice altering variants. Within each cohort, we looked for recurrent genes using two separate metrics: a binomial test p-value and the fraction of samples (see Methods). For ranking and selecting the most recurrent genes, each metric was computed by pooling across all cohorts. For assessing cancer-type specificity, each metric was then also computed using only results from a given cancer cohort.

After analyzing the effect of the exon skipping event on the mRNA sequence, we concluded that the reading frame remains intact, possibly leading to a gain of function event.

The transcript that results from use of this alternate donor site is missing the last twenty-eight amino acids that form the C-terminal end of p16<sup>ink4a</sup>.

To address this limitation, we created RegTools, a software suite for the analysis of variants and junctions in a splicing context. By relying on well-established standards for analyzing genomic and transcriptomic data and allowing flexible analysis parameters, we enable users to apply RegTools to a wide set of scientific methodologies and datasets. To ease the use and integration of RegTools into analysis workflows, we provide documentation and example workflows via (regtools.org) and provide a Docker image with all necessary software installed.</p><p hwp:id="p-30">In order to demonstrate the utility of our tool, we applied RegTools to 9,173 tumor samples across 35 tumor types to profile the landscape of this category of variants. From this analysis, we report 133,987 variants that cause novel splicing events that were missed by VEP or SpliceAI. Only 1.4 percent of these mutations were previously discovered by similar attempts, while 98.6 percent are novel findings. We demonstrate that there are splice altering variants that occur beyond the splice site consensus sequence, shift transcript usage between known transcripts, and create novel exon-exon junctions that have not been previously described. Specifically, we describe notable findings within <italic toggle="yes">B2M, RNF145, and CDKN2A</italic>. These results demonstrate the utility of RegTools in discovering novel splice-altering mutations and confirm the importance of integrating RNA and DNA sequencing data in understanding the consequences of somatic mutations in cancer. To allow further investigation of these identified events, we make all of our annotated result files (<bold>Supplemental Files 1-4</bold>) and recurrence analysis files (<bold>Supplemental Files 5-6</bold>) available.</p><p hwp:id="p-31">Understanding the splicing landscape is crucial for unlocking potential therapeutic avenues in precision medicine and elucidating the basic mechanisms of splicing. The exploration of novel tumor-specific junctions will undoubtedly lead to translational applications, from discovering novel tumor drivers, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and drug targets, to identifying a previously untapped source of neoantigens for personalized immunotherapy. While our analysis focuses on splice altering variants within cancers, we believe RegTools will play an important role in answering this broad range of questions by helping users extract splicing information from transcriptome data and linking it to somatic (or germline) variant calls. The computational efficiency of RegTools and increasing availability and size of such datasets may also allow for improved understanding of splice regulatory motifs that have proven difficult to accurately define such as exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and silencers. Any group with paired DNA and RNA-seq data for the same samples stands to benefit from the functionality of RegTools.</p></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-16">Methods</title><sec id="s4a" hwp:id="sec-9"><title hwp:id="title-17">Software implementation</title><p hwp:id="p-32">RegTools is written in C++.

For each event identified by RegTools, a normalized score (norm_score) was calculated for the junction of the event by dividing the number of reads supporting that junction by the sum of all reads for all junctions within the splice junction region for the variant of interest. This metric is conceptually similar to a “percent-spliced in” (PSI) index, but measures the presence of entire exon-exon junctions, instead of just the inclusion of individual exons. If there were multiple samples that contained the variant for the event, then the mean of the normalized scores for the samples was computed (mean_norm_score). If only one sample contained the variant, its mean_norm_score was thus equal to its norm_score. This value was then compared to the distribution of samples which did not contain the variant to calculate a p-value as the percentage of the norm_scores from these samples which are at least as high as the mean_norm_score computed for the variant-containing samples. We performed separate analyses for events involving canonical junctions (DA) and those involving novel junctions which used at least one known splice site (D/A/NDA), based on annotations in the corresponding reference GTF. For this study, we filtered out any junctions which did not use at least one known splice site (N) and junctions which did not have at least 5 reads of evidence across variant-containing samples. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was then applied to the remaining events. Following correction, an event was considered significant if its adjusted p-value was ≤ 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4f" hwp:id="sec-22"><title hwp:id="title-30">Annotation with GTEx junction data and other splice prediction tools</title><p hwp:id="p-55">Events identified by RegTools as significant were annotated with information from GTEx, VEP, SpliceAI, MiSplice, and Veridical. GTEx junction information was obtained from the GTEx Portal. Specifically, the exon-exon junction read counts file from the v8 release was used for data aligned to GRCh38 while the same file from the v7 release was used for the data aligned to GRCh37. Mappings between tumor cohorts and GTEx tissues can be found in <bold>Supplemental File 7</bold>. We annotated all starting variants with VEP in the “per_gene” and “pick” modes. The “per_gene” setting outputs only the most severe consequence per gene while the “pick” setting picks one line or block of consequence data per variant. We considered any variant with at least one splicing-related annotation to be “VEP significant”. All variants were also processed with SpliceAI using the default options.

Additional information, such as the splice sites predicted by SpliceAI, were also added to these session files to enhance the exploration of these events. Events of interest were manually reviewed in IGV to assess whether the association between the variant and junction made sense in a biological context (e.g. affected a known splice site, altered a genomic sequence to look more like a canonical splice site, or the novel junction disrupted active or regulatory domains of the protein product). An extensive review of literature and visualizations of junction usage in the presence and absence of the variant were also used to identify novel, biologically relevant events.</p></sec><sec id="s4f2" hwp:id="sec-24"><title hwp:id="title-32">Identification of genes with recurrent splice altering variants</title><p hwp:id="p-57">For each cohort, we calculated a p-value to assess whether the splicing profile from a particular gene was significantly more likely to be altered by somatic variants.
