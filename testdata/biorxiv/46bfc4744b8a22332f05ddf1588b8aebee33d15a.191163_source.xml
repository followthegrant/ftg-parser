While cluster-randomized trials (cRCTs) are less statistically efficient than individually randomized trials (iRCT), a cRCT’s ability to measure direct and indirect vaccine effects may mitigate the loss of efficiency due to clustering. Within cRCTs, the number and size of clusters affects three determinants of power: the effect size being measured, disease incidence, and intra-cluster correlation. We simulate trials conducted in a collection of small communities to assess how indirect protection and clustering affect the power of cRCTs and iRCTs during an emerging epidemic. Across diverse parameters, we find that within the same trial population, cRCTs are never more powerful than iRCTs, although the difference can be small. We also identify two effects that attenuate the loss of cRCT power traditionally associated with increased cluster size. First, if enrollment of fewer, larger clusters is performed to achieve higher vaccine coverage within vaccinated communities, this increases the effect to be measured and, consequently, power. Second, the greater rate of imported transmission in larger communities may increase the attack rate and similarly mitigate loss of power relative to a trial in many, smaller communities.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="36"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

Compared to individually randomized controlled trials (iRCTs), cRCTs may offer logistical, operational, and acceptability advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>), and allow the measurement of direct and indirect effects of vaccination, which are often relevant for policy-makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>). The statistical theory of cRCT design has largely focused on the effect of clustering, commonly measured by intracluster correlation, on power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>). Intracluster correlation arises because outcomes of members of the same cluster are more similar than those from different clusters. Therefore, increasing the number of individuals within a cluster provides less information than would adding the same number of individuals in a new cluster.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">When the trial outcome is an infectious disease, correlation arises also because each case in a cluster can transmit infection to other cluster members. Thus, trials of vaccines against infectious diseases exhibit a more complicated relationship between statistical power and sample size than in trials for non-infectious outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>); in particular, the total or overall vaccine effect measured by a cRCT is generally larger than the direct effect measured by an iRCT. In principle, this increased effect size in a cRCT might partially or fully offset the loss of power due to within-cluster correlation. Understanding these complexities can aid in vaccine trial design for emerging epidemics. While an important consideration in any clinical trial, maximizing efficiency is particularly crucial in trials during infectious disease emergencies such as the 2014-16 Ebola epidemic, where evaluation of experimental vaccines is especially urgent, and where limited available vaccine doses and/or changing disease incidence may constrain trial design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-8">In this paper, we first compare the power of an iRCT with that of a cRCT in the same population across a broad range of realistic parameters, taking into account that the cRCT is generally measuring a larger effect size. We hypothesized that, when R<sub>0</sub> is slightly above 1, a cRCT may have greater power to detect total vaccine effects than an iRCT would have to detect direct effects. Our justification was twofold. First, a vaccine’s total effect is greater than its direct effect and thus more easily detected. Second, when an iRCT is conducted within numerous small communities, the indirect effects of vaccination may reduce incidence amongst control participants sufficiently as to erode the trial’s power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>). In a second analysis, we restrict our attention to cRCTs and consider two decisions an investigator must navigate when balancing the number of clusters with the size of a cluster, for a given trial population size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Throughout we distinguish between <italic toggle="yes">communities</italic> that are targeted for enrollment, and <italic toggle="yes">clusters</italic> that comprise the individuals enrolled. When study clusters are sampled from communities, the first decision (<italic toggle="yes">enrollment proportion</italic>) concerns whether to enroll a larger proportion of each community from fewer communities, or to enroll a smaller proportion from a larger number of communities, fixing community size. The second decision (<italic toggle="yes">community size</italic>) concerns whether to recruit clusters from a smaller number of large communities or recruit from a larger number of small communities, fixing enrollment proportion.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;191163v2/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><p hwp:id="p-9">Schematic of an iRCT (top) and a cRCT (bottom).

In the iRCT, individuals within each cluster are randomized to vaccine (striped) or control (black). In the cRCT, half the clusters are randomized to vaccine and half to control. In the cRCT design, fixing the number of individuals enrolled, there are two ways to balance cluster size and number of clusters in the trial: (<bold>1</bold>) fixing the community size, vary the enrollment proportion and the number of communities enrolled, and (<bold>2</bold>) fixing the enrollment proportion, vary the community size and number of communities.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="191163_fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-1"/></fig><p hwp:id="p-10">With regard to enrollment proportion, recruiting a higher proportion of each community leads to higher vaccine coverage in communities receiving vaccination and thus more indirect protection to individuals therein. The greater overall protection may lead to increased power. With regard to community size, larger communities may experience an increased rate of introduction into the community if, for example, disease importations are proportional to the number of travelers to and from the community, which likely scales with community size. Both the increased indirect protection and the increased importation rate may increase power because they increase the effect size and the average number of cases in the trial population, respectively. These effects may thus partially counterbalance the loss of power that is known to accompany having fewer, larger clusters. We use a transmission model of an emerging directly transmitted infection (such as Ebola virus disease) to assess the contribution of these effects to the relative power of iRCTs and cRCTs.</p><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">METHODS</title><sec id="s1a" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">Theoretical Analysis</title><p hwp:id="p-11">We first explored the plausibility that cRCTs may be more efficient than iRCTs by using theoretical final size equations to calculate the expected outbreak probability and attack rate in clusters, varying enrollment proportion, R<sub>0</sub>, and vaccine efficacy (see Supplementary Material for details).

This assumption is essential as it increases the strength of indirect effects within clusters relative to scenarios in which there is more between-cluster transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>).

We assume that infections are introduced into communities via transmission from the main population, and the daily hazard of infection for an individual is proportional to the prevalence of infection in the main population. The community-level rate of disease importation (“importation rate”) is defined as the number of cases per year arising solely as a function of these external transmission events.

For the iRCT, a Cox proportional hazards (PH) analysis is performed to estimate the direct effect of the vaccine, stratifying by community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>). We define statistical significance at the α=5% level using a two-tailed Wald test, and for each combination of parameters we simulate 500 trials, estimating the power as the proportion of trials that reject the null hypothesis of no vaccine effect, which accounts for different estimands used by different designs. We calculate the median vaccine effect estimate across the simulated vaccine effect estimates. To estimate the Type I error of each design we repeat the above process with the true vaccine efficacy set to 0. To measure the magnitude of clustering in the cRCT we report the design effect, defined as <italic toggle="yes">DE</italic> = 1 + <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">m</italic> − 1), where <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> is the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) calculated using (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>), which is likely an underestimate of the ICC for time-to-event data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>), and <italic toggle="yes">m</italic> is the average size of a study cluster. The design effect increases with ICC, as subjects in the same cluster are more similar, and with the size of each cluster, as there are fewer, larger groups of similar individuals. The ICC is a measure of between-cluster variance relative to total variance in the outcome: if between-cluster variance is large relative to within-cluster variance, the ICC is large and individuals in the same cluster provide little information relative to individuals in different clusters.</p><p hwp:id="p-17">In this cRCT design, a Cox PH model estimates the total effect of vaccination. To ensure we used a cRCT analysis that maintains nominal Type I error when comparing cRCT power to that of an iRCT, we first compared Type I error between several methods to account for clustering when determining statistical significance within the cRCT design: namely, a Cox PH model with Gaussian- or gamma-distributed shared frailty, and a Cox PH model with robust standard error estimate. We excluded from analysis individuals who developed symptoms within 10 days after vaccination (the average incubation/latent period) to avoid diluting the vaccine effect by analyzing infections that preceded vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s1f" hwp:id="sec-7"><title hwp:id="title-8">Choice of parameters</title><p hwp:id="p-18"><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-1-1" hwp:rel-id="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the parameters used in the model, their meanings, values under baseline assumptions, range explored (where applicable), and references or justifications.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="T1" hwp:rev-id="xref-table-wrap-1-1 xref-table-wrap-1-2"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;191163v2/TBL1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">T1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">tbl1</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-2"><p hwp:id="p-19">Model Parameter Names, Values and Ranges Varied Across, Meanings and References or Justifications.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="191163_tbl1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-2"/></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-9">RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-9"><title hwp:id="title-10">Comparison of iRCT and cRCT</title><p hwp:id="p-20">In our theoretical analysis based on final size calculations, we found support for our initial hypothesis that cRCTs could be more efficient than iRCTs: when R<sub>0</sub> in vaccinated clusters in the cRCT is just above 1, the measured total effect is close to 1, which increases power; on the other hand, indirect effects in the iRCT drive down the incidence of disease among controls, undermining its power. Increasing enrollment proportion increases power of the cRCT relative to the iRCT, and there were parameter ranges for which the cRCT was more powerful than the iRCT; for example, with communities of size 100 and enrollment proportion 60%, we estimated that a cRCT would be more efficient than an iRCT when R<sub>0</sub> was close to 1.6 and vaccine efficacy was between 50% and 60% (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-1" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-21">However, our simulation model reveals that, across a broad range of parameters, including population structure, trial design and vaccine efficacy parameters, iRCTs were always were more powerful than cRCTs in the same population, despite the larger effect size being measured in cRCTs. The discrepancy between the models arises because theoretical calculations underestimate the average cumulative incidence, as well as the variability in transmission across clusters, when R<sub>0</sub> is close to 1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the power of simulated iRCT and cRCT designs versus R0, and highlights two findings. Firstly, the cRCT generally yields greater effect size estimates than the iRCT, because it measures the total vaccine effect rather than solely direct effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-2" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Secondly, the design effect is large and increases with increasing R<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-3" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), because large R<sub>0</sub> leads to more outbreaks within communities, which increases between-cluster variance and thus the ICC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-1" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. S1</xref>). Therefore, the power that the cRCT gains by measuring a larger effect is more than compensated by loss of efficiency due to within-cluster correlation. These two points explain why cRCT power first increases and then decreases with increasing R<sub>0</sub>. As R<sub>0</sub> increases past a certain threshold, the effect of clustering begins to dominate the effect of increased incidence in the study population, and the trial loses rather than gains power from the increased transmission.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F2" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-2-1 xref-fig-2-2 xref-fig-2-3 xref-fig-2-4 xref-fig-2-5 xref-fig-2-6"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;191163v2/FIG2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig2</object-id><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-3"><p hwp:id="p-22">Comparison of vaccine effect estimates and power of individually- and cluster-randomized controlled trials.

This is likely because vaccine coverage was low in the iRCT (a maximum of 50% of individuals within clusters are vaccinated) such that there is still sufficient transmission amongst control participants to evaluate the vaccine, in part because importation events from the main population occur even in the presence of herd immunity.</p><p hwp:id="p-24">The above results focus on the gamma-frailty model for analyzing the cRCT. We found that the estimated vaccine effect from a Cox PH model with robust standard errors (robust SE model) decreased drastically as R<sub>0</sub> increases. This occurred because the effect estimate from the robust SE model is not stratified by cluster, and is thus biased by heterogeneity in hazard of infection caused by stochastic variation in outbreak size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>). The gamma-frailty model can account for this heterogeneity and performed better, yielding both Type I error rates below 5% and unbiased estimates of total vaccine effects for many of the parameter combinations. Still, when R<sub>0</sub> was sufficiently small, the gamma-frailty model of cRCT designs did exhibit slightly elevated Type I error (see online <underline>Shiny App</underline>) due to sporadic and heterogeneous nature of outbreaks in the communities.</p><p hwp:id="p-25"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-4" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the power of the cRCT is strongly affected by the design effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-5" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), and that the difference in power between the cRCT and iRCT is smaller when there is low R<sub>0</sub>. This observation held when other parameters were varied, including trial start day (relative to epidemic onset), vaccine efficacy, importation rate, and population structure. In the setting of low R<sub>0</sub>, epidemics will die out stochastically in most clusters experiencing one or more case importation. The cluster-level attack rates are thus close to zero and the between-cluster variance is small (see online <underline>Shiny App</underline>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b" hwp:id="sec-10"><title hwp:id="title-11">Varying community enrollment proportion in a cRCT</title><p hwp:id="p-26">Restricting attention to cRCTs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-1" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3</xref> displays the vaccine effect estimate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-2" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), design effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), and power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-4" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) for a cRCT across varying <italic toggle="yes">community enrollment proportions</italic> (holding community sizes constant, but varying number of communities).

As the community size increases, the per-community importation rate increases and with it the expected proportion of communities that receive an importation. When R<sub>0</sub> is greater than 1 and many importations lead to outbreaks, fewer communities means that a higher proportion of communities experience outbreaks. In effect, to get fewer, larger communities one can imagine linking up small communities, meaning that an outbreak in one can spread to other small communities, boosting the attack rate. On the other hand, having many small communities means that outbreaks are limited by the size of the communities and the overall attack rate is lower. However, in this case the increased attack rate with fewer, larger communities is not large enough to offset the greater design effect and thus power decreases when increasing community size and decreasing community number.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F4" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-4-1 xref-fig-4-2 xref-fig-4-3 xref-fig-4-4 xref-fig-4-5 xref-fig-4-6 xref-fig-4-7"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;191163v2/FIG4</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F4</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig4</object-id><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-5"><p hwp:id="p-29">Relationship between power and size of enrolled communities for a cRCT.

We found that a Cox PH model with Gaussian-distributed frailty had significantly elevated Type I error (see online <underline>Shiny App</underline>). Fortunately, two common approaches to analyzing clustered survival data, a Cox PH model with gamma-distributed frailty or robust standard error estimation, were the best methods in terms of power and validity. The robust SE analysis has higher power than the gamma-frailty model when transmission is low. However, the model doesn’t account for heterogeneity in hazard rates in its estimate of the vaccine effect, leading to a downward bias that is particularly apparent when R<sub>0</sub> is high, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-6" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2</xref>. The gamma-frailty model is not susceptible to this bias.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" hwp:id="sec-13"><title hwp:id="title-14">DISCUSSION</title><p hwp:id="p-32">Traditional comparisons of cRCTs versus iRCTs that focus on within-cluster correlation and the design effect should also consider other ways in which the unit of randomization affects RCT power. Although an iRCT and a cRCT answer different research questions (measuring direct and total effects, respectively), a positive finding for either could arguably lead to the same policy outcome, especially during an epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>). For example, rVSV-EBOV was approved for use in the DRC in 2017 based on the findings of <italic toggle="yes">Ebola, ça suffit!</italic>, a cRCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>). We show that a cRCT’s ability to measure both indirect and direct effects can partially compensate for the loss of power due to clustering. Theoretical calculations suggest that cRCTs may exhibit greater statistical efficiency than iRCTs in some low R<sub>0</sub> scenarios. However, simulations that more realistically capture stochasticity in transmission suggest that iRCTs remain more powerful than cRCTs conducted in the same trial population. In low transmission settings the difference in power between them may be small, although for R<sub>0</sub> values lower than considered here a risk-prioritized design (such as ring vaccination) would be preferable, and these results should be examined separately in this context.</p><p hwp:id="p-33">The above comparisons between cRCTs and iRCTs can be extended to examine cRCTs of different cluster sizes (which is particularly apparent once noting an iRCT can be considered a cRCT with cluster size of one). For instance, within cRCT designs, enrolling more individuals from the same cluster is generally less statistically efficient than enrolling individuals in a new cluster. Previous work has argued that the ICC often decreases with cluster size, mitigating some loss of efficiency with larger clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>), and demonstrated how cross-contamination may increase when cRCTs are run in clusters of fewer individuals, reducing the effect to be estimated and thus power. Cross-contamination occurs either via transmission between intervention and control clusters or inadvertent receipt of intervention by control clusters, both of which are less likely when clusters are separated in space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>), or are sufficiently large that they are less impacted by external populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-34">Here, we show that, even in the absence of cross-contamination, indirect effects in themselves can mitigate the loss of efficiency caused by the increasing design effect associated with fewer, larger clusters. To our knowledge, this fact has been alluded to but the effect on power has never been quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>). Another counter-intuitive finding arises from the fact that, because larger communities experience a greater influx of transmission imported from elsewhere, enrolling fewer but larger communities may yield a greater attack rate, and thereby partly or fully compensate for the loss in power due to the design effect. This result is dependent on the relationship between case importation rate and community size. Consequently, this will differ by disease and population setting and may only be true in scenarios when a pathogen is not endemic to trial communities and the probability of pathogen introduction into a community is relatively low.</p><p hwp:id="p-35">Our findings highlighted the importance of adequately accounting for heterogeneity between study clusters while maintaining the nominal false positive rate and maximizing power. We limited the methods to those widely used and found that a Cox PH model with gamma-distributed frailty performs best overall; although when R<sub>0</sub> is low, a Cox PH model with robust SE may be superior.</p><p hwp:id="p-36">The results presented here are part of a body of work demonstrating the utility of simulation when considering the design of vaccine trials for infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>). It is only by including transmission dynamics in models that we are able to quantify the relative strength of clustering and indirect protection in affecting trial power. Our study is intended to explore these effects more generally, but we expect our findings to be relevant to investigators considering cRCT design, whether or not they develop a full-fledged trial simulation study during the planning phase. Theoretical work on trial design can help prepare stakeholders to rapidly design trials in the face of unexpected epidemics of emerging pathogens. However, it is important to note that sample size is only one of many factors that must be taken into consideration when planning a vaccine trial. Considerations of logistics, cost, ethics, acceptability or the particular research question of interest may, in certain contexts, hold priority.</p><p hwp:id="p-37">There are at least two sources of intracluster correlation in a cRCT for an infectious disease: transmission between individuals within a cluster, and the shared characteristics of individuals within a cluster. When R<sub>0</sub> is large enough, any outbreak that takes off will infect many individuals in a community so all clusters either have attack rate close to 0% or 100%. In such cases, there is very little within-cluster variance and the total variance comprises chiefly between-cluster variance, leading to ICCs approaching 1. Clustering due to shared characteristics can arise for many reasons, e.g. within-community similarities in behavior, health, or proximity to source populations. Intracluster correlation, whether due to transmission or to shared characteristics in clusters, increases the design effect. Given these different sources of clustering, and the fact that we observed ICCs ranging from 0.05 to 0.8 in our simulations, it is critically important that ICCs are reported by study investigators when presenting the results of a cRCT as this may aid in planning for future trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-38">Our analysis neglects some aspects of a realistic population in which a trial is conducted. For example, we do not consider the second source of clustering described above (i.e. shared characteristics). More broadly, modeled individuals do not vary in characteristics other than degree and the community to which they belong, whereas real populations would vary in age structure, proximity to the epicenter of the epidemic, and other variables that would predict disease incidence. By ignoring these characteristics we underestimate the extent of clustering in a cRCT and overstate its power. This makes more robust our conclusion that the iRCT is always more powerful than the cRCT in the situations considered.</p><p hwp:id="p-39">We have conceptualized the population structure as being a number of small groups separated in space so that there is minimal transmission between communities; in reality, population structure is likely to be less distinct. We have not considered permanent or temporary migration, nor secondary structure within communities (i.e. households). Moreover, real-life degree distributions have a heavier tail (due to superspreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>)) than considered here; though a sensitivity analysis shows our results are robust to this assumption (see online <underline>Shiny App</underline>).</p><p hwp:id="p-40">We find that the general principle that enrollment of fewer, larger clusters leads to decreased power is strongly dependent on the relationship between community size and rate of importation. Our base assumption that importation frequency proportional to the square root of community size is based on a finding for measles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>). For other diseases the community-level importation rate may be independent of community size, in which case the increased design effect would entirely dictate the loss of power as community size increases. Our conclusions should thus be considered in the context of each specific disease and population.</p><p hwp:id="p-41">The indirect effect of vaccination should be considered along with clustering in calculating the power of a cluster-randomized trial and in comparing different trial designs for interventions against infectious diseases. Using simulation we show that it does not always increase power to enroll more, smaller clusters into a cRCT, when doing so is associated with reduced indirect protection to vaccinated individuals or importation of infection into the study population. Still, while cRCTs measure a greater vaccine effect than iRCTs, we found that iRCTs are generally more powerful, though their power may be comparable in low-transmission settings.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-15">Acknowledgements</title></ack><ref-list hwp:id="ref-list-1"><title hwp:id="title-16">References and Notes</title><ref

Once infected, individuals spend a number of days in the exposed compartment drawn from a gamma distribution with mean 9.7 days and SD 5.5 days before moving into the infectious compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc7" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">7</xref>). They spend a number of days in the infectious compartment drawn from an independent gamma distribution with mean 5 and SD 4.7 based on data on the time to hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc7" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">7</xref>), after which they move into the removed compartment. For simplicity and to generalize away from the Ebola epidemic, we assume no <italic toggle="yes">post mortem</italic> transmission, meaning that whether an individual dies or recovers does not affect the estimated efficacy or power of the trial.</p><p hwp:id="p-54">Once enrolled, individuals are followed for a number of days and, for infected individuals, time from enrollment to symptom onset is recorded. Individuals who never develop symptoms are censored at the end of the study; there are no other sources of censoring. The vaccine is multiplicative leaky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc8" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">8</xref>), reducing susceptibility to infection by a factor (1-VE) and having no effect on those who are already exposed or infectious when vaccinated, and no effect on the progression or infectiousness of vaccinated individuals who become infected. We assume the protective efficacy of the vaccine starts on the day of vaccination.</p></sec></sec></sec><ref-list hwp:id="ref-list-2"><title hwp:id="title-24">REFERENCES</title><ref id="sc1" hwp:id="ref-24" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-24-1"><label>1.</label><citation publication-type="book" citation-type="book" ref:id="191163v2.24" ref:linkable="no" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-24"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Diekmann OH"><surname>Diekmann</surname> <given-names>OH</given-names></string-name>, <collab hwp:id="collab-2">J.A.P.</collab> <source hwp:id="source-24">Mathematical Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases.</source> <publisher-loc>Chichester, UK</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</publisher-name>; <year>2000</year>.</citation></ref><ref id="sc2" hwp:id="ref-25" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-25-1"><label>2.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="191163v2.25" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-25"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Haber M"><surname>Haber</surname> <given-names>M</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Longini IM Jr."><surname>Longini</surname> <given-names>IM</given-names>, <suffix>Jr.</suffix></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Halloran ME."><surname>Halloran</surname> <given-names>ME.</given-names></string-name> <article-title hwp:id="article-title-21">Measures of the effects of vaccination in a randomly mixing population</article-title>. <source hwp:id="source-25">Int J Epidemiol</source> <year>1991</year>;<volume>20</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>300</fpage>–<lpage>10</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="sc3" hwp:id="ref-26" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-26-1"><label>3.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="191163v2.26" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-26"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Schoenfeld DA."><surname>Schoenfeld</surname> <given-names>DA.</given-names></string-name> <article-title hwp:id="article-title-22">Sample-size formula for the proportional-hazards regression model</article-title>. <source hwp:id="source-26">Biometrics</source> <year>1983</year>;<volume>39</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>499</fpage>–<lpage>503</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="sc4" hwp:id="ref-27" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-27-1"><label>4.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="191163v2.27" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-27"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Wu S"><surname>Wu</surname> <given-names>S</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Crespi CM"><surname>Crespi</surname> <given-names>CM</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Wong WK."><surname>Wong</surname> <given-names>WK.</given-names></string-name> <article-title hwp:id="article-title-23">Comparison of methods for estimating the intraclass correlation coefficient for binary responses in cancer prevention cluster randomized trials</article-title>. <source hwp:id="source-27">Contemp Clin Trials</source> <year>2012</year>;<volume>33</volume>(<issue>5</issue>):<fpage>869</fpage>–<lpage>80</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="sc5" hwp:id="ref-28" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-28-1"><label>5.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="191163v2.28" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-28"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Kucharski AJ"><surname>Kucharski</surname> <given-names>AJ</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Camacho A"><surname>Camacho</surname> <given-names>A</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Flasche S"><surname>Flasche</surname> <given-names>S</given-names></string-name>, <etal>et al.</etal> <article-title hwp:id="article-title-24">Measuring the impact of Ebola control measures in Sierra Leone</article-title>. <source hwp:id="source-28">PNAS</source> <year>2015</year>;<volume>112</volume>(<issue>46</issue>):<fpage>14366</fpage>–<lpage>71</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="sc6" hwp:id="ref-29" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-29-1"><label>6.</label><citation publication-type="book" citation-type="book" ref:id="191163v2.29" ref:linkable="no" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-29"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Keeling MJ"><surname>Keeling</surname> <given-names>MJ</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Rohani P."><surname>Rohani</surname> <given-names>P.</given-names></string-name> <chapter-title>The Importance of Imports</chapter-title>.
