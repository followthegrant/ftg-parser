Infection begins during the cercarial stage of the life cycle when the freshwater-dwelling larval cercariae contacts the human host. Invasion of the skin is achieved through degradation of the extracellular matrix by cercarial elastase; this same enzyme may help avoid the host immune response through cleavage of human C3 Complement [?] <italic toggle="yes">S. mansoni</italic> sheds its immunogenic tail to progress to the more mobile schistosomula life cycle stage, where it is carried by blood flow to the lungs and hepatic portal system.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Using proteomic analysis, cercarial elastase was implicated in the cleavage of an extensive list of human proteins, with follow-up experiments confirming its cleavage of at least seven dermal proteins [?]. After schistosomula entry, maturation to the adult life cycle stage occurs in the inferior mesenteric blood vessels where a number of proteins aid in immune evasion and digestion of human hemoglobin proteins. Among the proteins expressed in the adult cycle is the adult tegument surface protein Sm29, a potential Schistosomiasis vaccine candidate antigen. Sm29 interacts with unknown human immune proteins [?]. The final life cycle stage in humans is the egg phase; mated adults produce hundreds of eggs per day to facilitate transmission back to fresh water. The immune reaction to eggs leads to schistome pathogenesis.

Host-pathogen protein complexes were identified using comparative modeling based on a similarity to protein complexes with experimentally determined structures.

This step is especially informative for <italic toggle="yes">S. mansoni</italic>, a digenetic organism, with life cycle stages and protein expression specific to both the molluscum and human hosts. While the human genome has been extensively annotated and made generally available, pathogen genome and expression annotation can be more elusive.

The sequencing effort is ongoing and there is limited annotation of corresponding proteins and structural information available. Thus, it is challenging even to cross-reference <italic toggle="yes">S. mansoni</italic> proteins described in various reports, particularly in those published prior to full genome sequencing [?]. Additionally, life cycle stage annotation is difficult to access or even absent in most databases.</p><p hwp:id="p-14">The best source of annotation is directly from primary references in literature. Most primary reference accessions were often embedded in portable document format (pdf) files and other file formats that make extraction challenging. Furthermore, the context of an extracted accession and the life cycle stage to which it applies must be isolated from each reference and verifiable for accuracy and further study. We address these challenges by designing a simple natural language processing engine (NLP) that accomplishes data extraction, accuracy, verifiability, and correlation between disperse data sets required to construct the Biological Context Filter.</p><p hwp:id="p-15">In Results below, we describe the benchmarking of our host-pathogen prediction protocol against experimentally characterized interactions, followed by a discussion of prospective prediction of novel host-pathogen interactions that may warrant experimental follow-up.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-10"><title hwp:id="title-11">Results &amp; Discussion</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-11"><title hwp:id="title-12">Protein Interaction Prediction</title><p hwp:id="p-16">The protocol begins with the initial set of 3,052 <italic toggle="yes">S. mansoni</italic> and 8,784 human protein sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) for which high-quality models could be created using MODTIE [?].

The first Network Filter removed interactions based on promiscuous domains, defined as templates used for more than 1% of the total predictions. Promiscuous domains, while present in many interacting complexes lack specificity and are overrepresented in the predicted data set, making them less desirable as vaccine candidate antigens. For example, a domain in the crystal structure of HIV Capsid Protein (p24) bound to FAB13B5, Protein Data Bank (PDB 1E6J), is frequently used template in potential interactions.</p><p hwp:id="p-20">However, immunoglobin is conserved in mammals and not specific to human interactions. Many variations will either not be applicable to <italic toggle="yes">S. mansoni</italic> and human interactions or conserved across species for binding similar epitopes. While most of the Fab (fragment antigen binding) region, which form the paratope, is highly variable in sequence, it is composed of less than 22 amino acids and relatively small. Many templates will score above the alignment threshold for this portion of the paratope and the short protein sequence acting as the epitope in the binding site based on shorter sequence lengths, high variability, and conservation across species resulting in a disproportionate number of potential interactions. Templates, similar to p24, were too generalized to draw conclusions with any degree of confidence and removed as promiscuous domains in the first Network Filter.</p><p hwp:id="p-21">In the second Network Filter, predictions based on homodimer complexes were removed. This step removes instances where highly conserved interacting dimers form similar complexes in both <italic toggle="yes">S. mansoni</italic> and humans due to speciation events [?, ?]. An example of such is the FGFR2 tyrosine kinase domain (PDB 1E6J). FGFR2 has high similarity to tyrosine kinases in <italic toggle="yes">S. mansoni,</italic> but were generally conserved in eukaryotes and thus comprise a bias in the homodimerization interaction of the catalytic subunits [?]. In the final Network Filter step, interactions with less than a 97% confidence interval were removed to further narrow the focus of potential interactions to a higher confidence level. This filtering results in the remaining 34,164 interactions.</p><p hwp:id="p-22">Next, the Biological Context Filter isolates potential interactions according to various life cycle stages of <italic toggle="yes">S. mansoni</italic> and likelihood of in vivo occurrence in human tissues. In the first step of the Biological Context Filter, interactions passing the Network Filter were enriched with data from a simple natural language processing (NLP) literature search and databases using listed nomenclature and functional information (Methods). However, there is limited life cycle stage expression information using database annotation.</p><p hwp:id="p-23">An NLP engine was designed to address this limitation and accomplished the following: (1) characterization of 12,720 <italic toggle="yes">S. mansoni</italic> genes automatically from primary reference; (2) recording of contextual, life cycle stage, and citation information into a customized database; and (3) programmatic correlation of this data with existing database annotations. This resulted in annotation of 96.6% of <italic toggle="yes">S.mansoni</italic> sequences, greatly exceeding existing annotation from any single database, which topped out at 62%.

First, genome-wide <italic toggle="yes">S. mansoni</italic> and human protein structure models were calculated by MODPIPE [?], an automated software pipeline for large-scale protein structure modeling [?]. MODPIPE uses MODELLER [?] to perform the canonical comparative modeling steps of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model construction, and model assessment. High-scoring models were deposited in MODBASE [?], a publicly accessible database of comparative models. Next, resulting models were aligned to SCOP domain sequences, and if a model aligned to a SCOP sequence with more than 70% identity, it was assigned that SCOP domain identifier. These annotations were used as the basis for a search in PIBASE, a database of domain-domain interactions. In this search, those models assigned a SCOP domain that was part of a PIBASE interaction were structurally aligned to the conformation of that domain in the complex. In cases where a human model was aligned to one domain in a PIBASE interaction and an <italic toggle="yes">S. mansoni</italic> model was aligned to the other domain, a putative modeled complex resulted. This complex was then assessed with the MODTIDE potential, which outputs a Z-score approximating the statistical likelihood of the individual domain interface residues forming a complex across the two proteins.
