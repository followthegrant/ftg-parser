This makes it extremely difficult to find a benchmark modulus of lung tissue when designing synthetic extracellular matrices (ECMs). To address this issue, we tested tissues from various areas of the lung using multiple characterization techniques, including micro-indentation, small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS), uniaxial tension, and cavitation rheology. We report the sample preparation required and data obtainable across these unique but complimentary methods to quantify the modulus of lung tissue. We highlight cavitation rheology as a new method, which can measure the modulus of intact tissue with precise spatial control, and reports a modulus on the length scale of typical tissue heterogeneities. Shear rheology, uniaxial, and indentation testing require heavy sample manipulation and destruction; however, cavitation rheology can be performed <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> across nearly all areas of the lung with minimal preparation. The Young’s modulus of bulk lung tissue using microindentation (1.9±0.5 kPa), SAOS (3.2±0.6 kPa), uniaxial testing (3.4±0.4 kPa), and cavitation rheology (6.1±1.6 kPa) were within the same order of magnitude, with higher values consistently reported from cavitation, likely due to our ability to keep the tissue intact. Although cavitation rheology does not capture the non-linear strains revealed by uniaxial testing and SAOS, it provides an opportunity to measure mechanical characteristics of lung tissue on a microscale level on intact tissues. Overall, our study demonstrates that each technique has independent benefits, and each technique revealed unique mechanical features of lung tissue that can contribute to a deeper understanding of lung tissue mechanics.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="26"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

In order to properly ventilate the alveoli to facilitate gas exchange, it must maintain a delicate balance between strength and compliance to allow for these repeated, massive expansions. Lung parenchyma is the area of the lung that is involved with gas exchange, including the alveoli and smaller bronchioles, but excludes the large, cartilaginous bronchi. Lung parenchyma derives its mechanical integrity from the ECM, which is primarily composed of elastin, laminin, and collagen (Maksym and Bates 1997, Ito, Ingenito et al. 2005, Suki, Ito et al. 2005, Nichols, Niles et al. 2013). Others have shown that these structural proteins contribute to the mechanical properties of tissues (Liu and Tschumperlin 2011, Suki, Stamenovic et al. 2011).</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Many research groups have measured and modeled the mechanical properties of the lungs with <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> techniques (Stamenovic 1990, Suki 2014), such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), uniaxial testing, and rheology; however, no group has presented data that directly compares these methods. Reports of lung parenchyma Young’s moduli range locally from ~2kPa (Liu, Mih et al. 2010) to greater than 15 kPa (Melo, Garreta et al. 2013) depending on the health of the tissue, the technique applied, and location of the measurement. This is an important point, as changes in stiffness by just a few kPa affects the phenotype of lung fibroblasts (Asano, Ito et al. 2017). The fact that the reports of lung moduli varies larger than changes sensed by cells makes it challenging for researchers in the biomaterials community to derive mechanobiological relationships, limiting applications in regenerative medicine and pathophysiology.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">To determine the modulus of intact lung parenchyma, most procedures have traditionally applied pressure to excised lungs (Lai-Fook and Hyatt 2000, Dai, Peng et al. 2015), or used MRI (Mariappan, Kolipaka et al. 2012) or spirometry to determine their properties non-invasively (Gibson and Pride 1976). MRI yields shear stiffnesses ranging from 0.81 to 3.2kPa depending on the degree of inflation (Goss, McGee et al. 2006). Ultrasound is another non-invasive technique that has reported moduli from 752 to 954 Pa (Zhang, Qiang et al. 2011). Indentation, uniaxial extension, and other direct, local measurement devices are precise, but typically result in damage to the tissue structure from routine sample preparation. In contrast, the drawbacks to non-invasive methods are that they are very expensive and do not currently have the resolution to capture mechanical information on the sub-centimeter scale. These local heterogeneities could be an important factor for bioengineered tissue mimics given the lung’s heterogeneous composition.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">Even still, many of the techniques measuring local mechanical properties are conducted on excised tissue samples. It is very difficult to determine local mechanical properties on small regions of the lungs without removing them, unless one uses a complex and expensive techniques, such as ultrasound (Zhang, Osborn et al. 2016) or MRI elastography (Mariappan, Kolipaka et al. 2012). Therefore, a simple, direct technique that would not require destructive preparation would be optimal. One such technique that has yet to be applied to lung tissue is cavitation rheology (Zimberlin, Sanabria-DeLong et al. 2007, Jansen, Birch et al. 2015), which does not require destructive sample preparation, is relatively inexpensive, and is portable. By not requiring significant handing or manipulation of the samples, one can perform <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> measurements of the lung tissue in as close to its relaxed state as possible without tissue destruction.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">In this study, we describe the application of cavitation rheology to lung tissue, and we attempt to unify tissue modulus measurements by comparing cavitation rheology to other traditional tissue mechanics approaches (Zimberlin, Sanabria-DeLong et al. 2007). We compared cavitation to popular techniques in the field: micro-indentation, uniaxial testing via Instron, and SAOS with a parallel plate rheometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>). By performing these techniques on the same samples, we provide a direct comparison across measurement modalities. This data provides important information that the field can use to recapitulate the lung modulus with tissue models, and provides insight into local mechanical properties of the intact lung.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4 xref-fig-1-5 xref-fig-1-6"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;271726v2/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><title hwp:id="title-3">Methods Used to Quantify Lung Modulus.</title><p hwp:id="p-9">Lungs from <bold>12</bold> animals were tested using multiple methods. For each method, an example force-displacement or force-time curve is shown for a typical tissue sample, as well as an inset image of the tissue sample being actively tested. (a) Cavitation rheology uses a small needle inserted into an intact tissue, wherein a sensor measures the pressure required to cavitate a bubble within a tissue. This cavitation pressure was then input into a model to find a tissue compliance and an effective modulus. (b) SAOS requires defined, excised samples and applies shear across a range of oscillatory frequencies, resulting in a dynamic modulus, storage modulus (G’), and loss modulus (G”), which can be related to the Young’s modulus via the Poisson’s ratio (<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>). (c) Micro-indentation requires excised samples with defined thicknesses and applies small compressive forces, results in a force-displacement curve, the slope of which resulted in a Young’s modulus. (d) Uniaxial testing applies tension to a prepared, excised sample, resulting in a stress-strain curve, the slope of which relays a Young’s modulus. Due to the heterogeneity of the ECM in structure and composition, lung tissue has two different regimes: an initial toe region, and a steeper, sloped region.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="271726_fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-1"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-4">MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-5">Lung Tissue and Sample Preparation</title><p hwp:id="p-10">Porcine lungs were acquired from Research 87 (Boston, MA) and immediately placed on ice for transport.

Briefly, the instrument is composed of a syringe pump (Nexus 6000; Chemyx Inc., Stafford, CT), pressure sensor (PX26-005DV; Omega, Stamford, CT), and a syringe needle connected to a DAQ card to record the pressure over the course of the experiment. Needles with varying gauges of 16, 18, 22, and 26 (1.194, 0.838, 0.413, 0.260 mm inner diameters, respectively) (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) were inserted into the lung until they pierced the viscera pleura. The needles had beveled tips to decrease the stress on the needle and to pierce the lung.

Excess material was trimmed with a scalpel and surgical scissors. A solvent trap was used to prevent the samples from dehydrating over the duration of the experiment and the plate was maintained at either 25°C or 37°C to test the tissue sensitivity to temperature.

Freezing the lung samples after slaughter is the most common method for labs to preserve decellularized (Nonaka, Campillo et al. 2014) and native tissues (Graham, Hodson et al. 2010). Freezing or embedding into agarose (Booth, Hadley et al. 2012) is often the only way AFM sections can be prepared for indentation when thin samples are required.

However, the lung is a structurally and mechanically heterogeneous tissue, with regions of high and low stiffness and porosity, which are difficult to comprehensively capture. Significant research has been performed to understand lung mechanics to fully grasp this complexity and in an attempt to correlate lung structure and compliance with organ-, tissue-, and cell-scale behaviors. One challenge in achieving this goal is that studies have used a variety of different techniques quantified the compliance of lung tissue: from indentation on small, excised samples to elastography on of whole lungs <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic>. Therefore, one of our goals was to take the first step in unifying a variety of different methods, we directly compared various testing modalities to determine how the reported modulus of lung tissue varies across them given the inherent constraints for each method: differences in sample preparation, temperature, and region of tissue tested. This effort will enable the field to compare measured and reported values, using different methods to quantify a tissue modulus, and will help to create a more accurate hydrogel model for simulating <italic toggle="yes">in</italic> vivo-like compliance of the lung. In doing this comparative study, our most significant findings are that the modulus of lung tissue does vary depending on the testing modality used (though each reported value is within the same order of magnitude), the order of testing does not significantly affect the reported modulus, freezing tissue samples has a modest, though detectable effect on the reported modulus, and cavitation rheology is the only method capable of reporting a localized <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> modulus.</p><p hwp:id="p-35">We obtained and tested samples as soon as possible post-slaughter (within hours, and tissues were kept hydrated). <italic toggle="yes">In vivo</italic> lung tissue is in a pre-stressed state (Suki, Stamenovic et al. 2011), therefore, some variation between our measurements and those obtained <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, if that were possible, would be expected. Practically speaking, many labs will not be able to use freshly obtained lung tissue, as we did here, and so we also quantitatively compared the effect of several freezing techniques on the lung tissue mechanical properties. We found a detectable decrease in Young’s modulus when flash freezing using LN2, but not when slow freezing to −80°C. The benefit is that these techniques did not require samples to be flash frozen (Graham, Hodson et al. 2010, Luque, Melo et al. 2013) or embedded in agar (Liu, Mih et al. 2010, Liu and Tschumperlin 2011) prior to measurement, which would have introduced additional confounding mechanical changes to the samples.</p><p hwp:id="p-36">There is limited knowledge on nonlinear, viscoelastic, heterogenous, and anisotropic materials. Therefore, we employed techniques that are commonly used in the tissue mechanics field to approximate the linear and non-linear responses of lung tissue. From our measurements, we determined that microindentation, cavitation rheology, uniaxial extension, and SAOS tests were in line with some of the previously reported values for the lung (~5 kPa) (Suki and Bates 2008, Booth, Hadley et al. 2012, Luque, Melo et al. 2013). The experimental modulus values for lung tissue for micro-indentation (1.9±0.5 kPa), SAOS (3.2±0.6 kPa), and uniaxial testing (3.4±0.4 kPa) are based on measuring a modulus for the bulk material, however cavitation (6.1±1.6 kPa) measures the modulus on a length scale approaching that of the microstructures of the lung. We suggest that the information provided with these different measurement modalities can spur further interest in refining <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> mechanical models of the lung microenvironment.</p><p hwp:id="p-37">Our second goal was to demonstrate a new technique for measuring the modulus of lung tissue at similar length scales to that of microstructure heterogeneities within tissue. Cavitation rheology was the least destructive technique we applied in that we did not need to excise any tissue to perform the testing; however, the range of measurements on individual samples, as well as the average values across multiple lung tissues, was detectably higher in comparison to values obtain from the other approaches used here. The higher modulus of cavitation may be the result of ECM fiber reorientation during extension of the material. In support of this speculation, we observed strain-hardening with uniaxial extension, though not with SAOS or micro-indentation. The nonlinearity of the uniaxial testing can be largely attributed to the alignment and extension of collagen, which is a main contributor of mechanical strength to tissue (Suki, Stamenovic et al. 2011). It is possible that cavitation rheology is more sensitive to the mechanical response at larger strains for tissues with nonlinear properties, but more fundamental studies of cavitation dynamics are required to understand these responses. It is difficult to extract the contributions of the individual ECM proteins in the tested tissue using these techniques; however, it would be interesting to explore a similar gamut of modalities to find how the moduli compare. Modifications to the cavitation model could be extracted from direct observation of deformations under pressure mimicking <italic toggle="yes">in</italic> vivo-like conditions or through degrading various ECM components (Black, Allen et al. 2008). In previous work, our lab found that bone marrow modulus also agrees cross-platform, however without compensation for strain rate, cavitation rheology reports a higher modulus as compared to SAOS and micro-indentation (Jansen, Birch et al. 2015). Due to the small diameters of the needles, cavitation testing was more localized than the other techniques we used. Higher variability from cavitation compared to indentation and SAOS may have been due to fact that bronchiole-free areas were selected in the excised tissues for indentation and SAOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-5" hwp:rel-id="F6">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). It is likely that in addition to sample selection, cavitation rheology is more sensitive to local heterogeneities in the tissue, much like AFM.</p><p hwp:id="p-38">To confirm the trend that cavitation rheology testing results in a higher modulus value than other techniques, we tested a PEG hydrogel across the multiple mechanical methods. This PEG hydrogel can have a wide range in elastic moduli, which depends on the molecular weight of the polymer and the concentrations of the crosslinker (Peyton, Raub et al. 2006, Killion, Geever et al. 2011). After testing multiple conditions (data not shown), we chose gels with 4 vol% PEGDMA, as it had a stress-strain response and a Young’s modulus similar to the lung tissue samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-3" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We used the PEG gels to determine if the consistently higher moduli reported by cavitation rheology found in the lung samples, and previously in bone marrow tissue (Jansen, Birch et al. 2015), was also found in a polymer hydrogel. When we compared cavitation rheology to indentation, we found that cavitation reported a higher modulus than indentation, consistent with the measurements in tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-4" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). Furthermore, we have previously published that cavitation rheology reports a higher modulus compared to other testing methods in synthetic hydrogel systems (Zimberlin, Sanabria-DeLong et al. 2007, Zimberlin and Crosby 2010). Because cavitation rheology is measuring the modulus of a material on length scales in the tens of microns, it is possibly sensitive to the mechanical contribution of local lung tissue microstructures. This is one possible explanation for more consistent results in the polymer hydrogels compared to the lung tissue samples (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-5" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Indentation, SAOS, and uniaxial strain were potentially not sensitive enough to sense the mechanical contribution of microstructures, or handling and excision resulted in significant tissue damage that caused a decrease in the observed moduli.</p><p hwp:id="p-39">There are other factors to consider as contributors to variation in modulus measurements, such as the strain rate at which the test is carried out, the contributions of stiff elements of the lungs that cannot be seen during testing, such as bronchioles near the testing area, variation in alveolar size, and potential contributions due to porosity (Litzlbauer, Korbel et al. 2010, Jansen, Birch et al. 2015). We applied a strain rate of 0.01Hz in uniaxial extension, which was calculated by normalizing the global displacement rate by the gauge length. Cavitation rheology testing was performed at a strain rate of 0.028Hz, estimated based on the air injection rate. Indentation tests had a compressive strain rate of 0.04Hz, based on the rate of compression, normalized by the sample thickness. The strain rates applied in SAOS varies from 1 to 10 Hz based on the shear rate and the total deformation of the material. To determine how strain rate contributed to differences in the reported moduli, we varied the strain rate of indentation on PEG hydrogels between 0.1 and 1 Hz, encompassing the full range of strain rates covered by the different testing methods. We observed that the modulus was independent of the strain rate, at least across this range, suggesting that differences in lung moduli reported by each of these individual measurements was not due to strain rate differences.</p><p hwp:id="p-40">Beyond strain rate differences between measurement methods, another possible contribution to the differences between measurements is the model used to interpret cavitation rheology. The model for relating cavitation pressure to the Young’s modulus used in this study was developed for flat needles, and our use of beveled needles to reduce tissue damage at the surface could have impacted the measurements, as there is a difference in the needle diameter at the opening versus the actual diameter of the needle’s shaft in the beveled tip geometry (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-1-1" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-1">Equation 1</xref>). In addition, due to the opacity of the tissue, we could not visually confirm if fracture or cavitation occurred within the tissue (Kundu and Crosby 2009, Zhang, Osborn et al. 2016). Since the model applied to the tissue is intended for non-porous, elastic materials, adjustments to this model could allow for a more detailed understanding of the relationship between cavitation pressure and the lung’s mechanical properties.</p><p hwp:id="p-41">With these differences acknowledged, we still confirm that cavitation rheology provides a consistent measurement of mechanical properties on a tens of microns scale, providing a method for characterizing the localized heterogeneities within lung tissue. This attribute is significant since this length scale is likely more pertinent to how cells interact with their local environment. Therefore, measuring the modulus of tissues and biomaterials with cavitation provides significant advantages not only in characterizing mechanical properties of lung but also when designing materials to represent lung tissue.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-22">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p hwp:id="p-42">We would like to acknowledge Mike Imburgia, Shruti Rattan, and Lauren Jansen for their help with uniaxial testing, micro-indentation, and cavitation rheology.
