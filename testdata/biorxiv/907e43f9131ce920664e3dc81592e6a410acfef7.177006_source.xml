The heterogeneity of folding/aggregation landscape and transient nature of the early intermediates result in difficulty in developing a successful therapeutic intervention. Here we used fluorescence measurements at ensemble and single molecule resolution to study how the late and early events of alpha synuclein aggregation modulate each other. The in-vitro aggregation data was complemented using measurements inside live neuroblastoma cells by employing a small molecule labeling technique. An inhibitor molecule (arginine), which delayed the late event of amyloidosis, was found to bind to the protein, shifting the early conformational fluctuations towards a compact state. In contrast, a facilitator of late aggregation (glutamate), was found to be excluded from the protein surface. The presence of glutamate was found to speed up the oligomer formation at the early stage. We found that the effects of the inhibitor and facilitator were additive and as a result they maintained a ratio at which they cancelled each other’s influence on different stages of alpha synuclein aggregation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Keywords</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">Protein aggregation</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">glutamate</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">arginine</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">single molecule fluorescence</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="29"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-3">INTRODUCTION</title><p hwp:id="p-4">Protein aggregation is believed to be a common molecular theme for several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), in which alpha synuclein (α-syn) aggregates to form Lewy bodies [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>]. There is no cure available at present, and the heterogeneity of the folding/aggregation landscape is a crucial bottleneck towards the development of a disease-modifying therapeutics. Literature results suggest that the folding/aggregation landscape of α-syn is complex, containing at least three components. The most widely studied one is the formation of amyloid fibrils, which happens late. Amyloid fibril formation of α-syn and other proteins can be studied conveniently using thioflavin T (ThT), a dye whose fluorescence enhances when bound to the fibrils. While the late fibril formation can be investigated easily, monitoring early events is difficult. Using single molecule spectroscopy, it has been shown that the protein fluctuates rapidly between different conformers and form small molecules oligomers. We emphasize that it is important to study both the early and late events of aggregation. This is because; a) the early events may enable the faster detection of the disease and b) recent results point towards the toxicity associated with the early oligomers [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. It is often argued that the formation of the amyloid fibrils may be a preventive mechanism by which toxicity induced by the oligomers could be minimized. However, opposing views exist, hypothesizing a direct role of amyloid fibrils (and Lewy Bodies) in PD pathology [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-5">In this paper, we used a simple small molecules based strategy in combination with fluorescence spectroscopy at the ensemble and single molecule resolution to investigate both the early and late stages of α-syn aggregation. The objective of this study is to determine how the early and late stages of α-syn aggregation modulate the effect of each other. The first step of this strategy was to select two small molecules, which would either delay (the inhibitor) or promote (the facilitator) the overall aggregation of α-syn (the late stage outcome) in aqueous solution and inside live cells. The second step of the strategy was to probe the effects of the inhibitor and facilitator molecules on the early stages of α-syn folding/aggregation landscape. By doing these experiments, we aimed to find out if the early conformational fluctuations and oligomerization were affected by the inhibitor and facilitator molecules.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">For the measurements of the late stage aggregation (the first step of the strategy), we used ThT fluorescence, which was complimented by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). For the measurements inside live cells, we employed a cell culture model using small molecule fluorescent labels of α-syn expressing in neuroblastoma cell lines. For the measurements of conformational fluctuations and oligomerization at the early stage (the second step of the present strategy), we used the help of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), a method which monitors diffusional and conformational dynamics of fluorescently labeled biomolecules at single molecule resolution. For the analysis of FCS data, the conventional discrete component analysis was supplemented by maximum entropy method (MEM).</p><p hwp:id="p-7">We assumed that the late stage experiments in aqueous solution would enable us to determine the direct role these small molecules play to modulate the aggregation of the protein. These direct roles may originate from the binding between the protein and small molecule or from the preferential exclusion. In contrast, live cells data are expected to be complex containing multiple components of differing contributions. Protein aggregation, neuro-degeneration and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been extensively studied and widely debated. We used two amino acids, namely glutamate, and arginine as our choice for the facilitator and inhibitor respectively for the late stage of α-syn aggregation. These molecules are chosen for their proven roles in neurodegeneration. Glutamate, being an excitatory amino acid, has been shown to induce neurotoxic effects and time-dependent cell deaths [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>-<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>]. Extracellular glutamate binds to its specific receptors resulting in calcium influx inside cells, which leads to the generation of ROS [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, the accumulation of ROS has been shown to result in aggregation. It has been suggested by Hashimoto and Souza group that oxidative stress increases the accumulation and aggregation of α-syn inside cell [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>, <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>]. Long-term exposure to oxidative stress has been shown to induce α-syn aggregation in primary neuronal cultured cells [<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>]. Increased α-syn aggregation after rotenone exposure in cultured cells might be the result of increased ROS generation in the presence of rotenone. Although glutamate-induced neurodegeneration has been investigated, its effect on aggregation has not been studied in live cells. In contrast, L-arginine has been found to offer potent in-vitro and in-vivo neuroprotection [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>]. Poly-arginine and arginine rich peptides have been shown to induce protection against glutamate induced excitotoxicity[<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>]. While the double role of amino acids (neurodegeneration vs. protection) has been a subject of extensive interests, any mechanistic understanding is absent.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">The results obtained in the present study showed that the competition between conformational fluctuations and oligomerization could be a key factor in defining the folding-aggregation landscape of α-syn. The presence of arginine and glutamate influenced the competition between conformational fluctuations and oligomerizations differently. While the presence of arginine favored the compact conformer in equilibrium, the addition of glutamate sped up oligomers formation. We determined that the influence of one of these molecules can be canceled by introducing the second molecules. Finally using isothermal calorimetry (ITC) and mass spectroscopy, we found out that the effect of arginine was probably due to the binding of multimeric arginine onto the protein molecules, while glutamate remained excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-4">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-5"><italic toggle="yes">In-vitro</italic> and live cell data suggest that arginine is an inhibitor and glutamate is a facilitator for the late stage of aggregation</title><p hwp:id="p-9">First, we wanted to investigate how glutamate (which typically induces neurodegeneration) and arginine (often used as a neuro-protector) influenced the aggregation of α-syn. Since the measurement of the late stage of aggregation is relatively straightforward, it was attempted first. To induce aggregation, we agitated protein samples at 37°C for multiple hours, while the extent of aggregation was studied using ThT fluorescence. Normal glutamate concentration in blood is 40-50μM, and the average daily intake of glutamate in human body has been estimated to be 0.3-1 g [<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>]. That means that an average person of 70 kg can uptake around 0.06-0.2 mg/ml or 0.3-1.1mM of glutamate in blood, which is often utilized in glutamate-glutamine cycle in presynaptic terminals and glial cells[<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>].

Since the molecular weight of GFP (∼27kDa) is greater than that of α-syn (∼14kDa), the influence of GFP on the aggregation property of α-syn may not be negligible [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>].

The results in aqueous solution showed that the addition of salt increased aggregation with increasing concentration of NaCl, with very high extent of aggregation observed in the presence of 100mM concentration. Since arginine contains a guanidinium moiety in its structure, which is expected to play an important role in the aggregation inhibition property (see later), we used guanidinium hydrochloride as another control. The presence of guanidinium hydrochloride resulted in inhibition of the aggregation, which was observed for both in-vitro and in cell experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-5" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-6" hwp:rel-id="F4">B</xref>).

ITC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-1" hwp:rel-id="F8">Figure 8A</xref>) clearly suggested a two steps sequential binding between α-syn and arginine, which was found to be enthalpically unfavorable, but entropically driven ((Δ<italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">1</italic></sub> in this case is +51.1 cal/mol/K and Δ<italic toggle="yes">S</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">2</italic></sub> = 699 cal/mol/K). The displacement of ordered water molecules by arginine is expected to be enthalpically unfavorable which would involve breaking of multiple hydrogen bonds. Since arginine has been reported to form well-arranged cluster structure through π-stacking interaction through its guanidium moiety [<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>], the internal energy is larger for this kind of already existing well-packed structures.

Relatively higher endothermic ΔH suggested the probability of the replacement of strong arginine-arginine molecular interaction with protein-arginine interaction, especially in the well-ordered cluster system and the process is favorable (ΔG= −5.6 Kcal/mol) (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn16" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-16-1" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-16">equation 16</xref>).

The role of a small molecule depends on many factors including a competition between direct binding and preferential exclusion. An osmolyte like glutamate may not bind to a protein; rather they prefer to remain excluded. The aggregation facilitation property of glutamate presumably comes from preferential exclusion from the protein surface, because of which glutamate would favor conformational states with less surface area facilitating aggregation (as aggregation reduces overall surface area). The use of aspartate (which has the same charge) did not seem to have any major effect supporting the hypothesis that there was no significant binding. However, it is difficult to explain the difference in behaviour between glutamate and aspartate-primarily because of the fact that the osmophobic property of aspartate is not well studied. In contrast, the presented ITC results supported arginine binding to the protein. Arginine has been found to weakly bind to protein molecules through aromatic residues using cation-pi interactions [<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref>]. The importance of the guanidinium moiety, which is present in arginine, has been noted by the fact that lysine (with similar charge and no guanidinium moiety) did not inhibit α-syn aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-7" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, guanidinium hydrochloride was found to inhibit aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-8" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The apparent difference in the dose dependence of guanidinium hydrochloride and arginine is not explained completely at present, but it should be noted that guanidinium hydrochloride is a strong denaturant while arginine is not. The involvement of supramolecular assembly of arginine towards protein binding has been suggested [<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>].
