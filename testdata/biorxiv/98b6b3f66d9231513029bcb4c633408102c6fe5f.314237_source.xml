Coordinated activity in multiple tracts often converges on the same motor output. For example, distinct phases of targeted forelimb movement are controlled by different sets of corticospinal tract distributed through motor cortex, in coordination with other nuclei including the red nucleus and reticular formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">Alstermark et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Esposito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">Kuypers H. and Martin, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Lemon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">Siegel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Clarifying the different contributions of supraspinal populations to basic motor control, remains a challenge. In addition, this complexity presents a significant challenge for the study and the treatment of spinal injuries. Spinal injuries in both human patients and animal models are highly variable, leaving each individual with different subsets of descending axon tracts intact. Thus, a major question in the field is how plasticity in distinct supraspinal tracts, both spontaneous and treatment-induced, yields behavioral improvements. Conversely, the fact that supraspinal neurons are distributed so widely and carry both discrete and overlapping functions presents a challenge for the delivery of therapeutics. Genetic interventions that boost the intrinsic growth ability of supraspinal neurons are showing promise in enhance regenerative axon growth from various types of neurons including corticospinal, rubrospinal, and reticulospinal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">Blackmore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">Geoffroy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Liu et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">Z.

In these proof-of-principle studies vectors are typically delivered by direct brain injection, yet this approach is impractical to reach all supraspinal neurons in rodent models, let alone human patients.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">The development of new viral vectors with effective retrograde transduction properties affords new opportunities to address these challenges. Descending axons converge to relatively small target fields in the spinal cord, and thus a small number of retrograde injections could potentially affect widely distributed supraspinal neurons of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">Frampton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">Nassi et al., 2015</xref>). The potential utility of this retrograde approach is well recognized, but has been limited by inadequate efficiency of transduction, particularly for corticospinal tract neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Jara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Klaw et al., 2013</xref>). Here we harness a recently developed adeno-associated serotype termed AAV2-Retro as a tool to clarify supraspinal connectivity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>). We first demonstrate that AAV2-Retro delivered to the cervical and lumbar spinal cord drives rapid and highly efficient transduction of supraspinal populations including reticular, red nucleus, and corticospinal. Importantly, retrograde transduction remained equally effective when vectors were delivered after spinal injury, highlighting the potential for therapeutic delivery. We then employ tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy to present detailed visualizations of supraspinal neurons and descending axon tracts in whole brain preparations. Finally, we test a retrograde viral approach to probe the function of supraspinal inputs. We found that after retrograde delivery of inhibitory Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), receptor activation in transduced supraspinal populations was sufficient to induce complete forelimb paralysis. Moreover, when we employed transgenic targeting in conjunction with Retro-DREADD delivery to enrich expression in corticospinal tract neurons, receptor activation produced movement deficits highly consistent with selective CST ablation. Overall these data highlight the utility of a retrograde viral approach for therapeutic gene delivery, as a tool for neuroanatomical tracing, and for functional dissection of supraspinal circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s3" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3a" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-5">Viral injection and spinal injuries</title><p hwp:id="p-7">All animal procedures were approved by the Marquette University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

For tissue clearing, four animals received cervical injection of Retro-AAV-tdTomato to cervical spinal cord and were sacrificed 14 days later, and three adult female mice received both cervical AAV2-Retro-EGFP and lumbar AAV2-Retro-tdTomato and were sacrificed four weeks later. DREADD experiments were initiated with 5 wildtype and 5 CAMKII-Cre female mice injected with AAV2-Retro-DREADD constructs, and three uninjected wildtype females. One Camkii-Cre was lost to mortality. Slip rates in the presence or absence of clozapine stimulation on the ladder task were compared by paired t-tests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-10"><title hwp:id="title-11">RESULTS</title><sec id="s4a" hwp:id="sec-11"><title hwp:id="title-12">AAV2-Retro effectively transduces reticulospinal, rubrospinal, and corticospinal neurons</title><p hwp:id="p-13">AAV serotypes vary widely in their tropism for different types of neurons and their onset of transgene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Castle et al., 2016</xref>).

As control, four additional animals received AAV2-Retro-tdTomato/CTB-488 injections without injury. Animals were sacrificed at 28 days post-injection and a complete series of 120µm sections of the brain was collected, along with sagittal sections of the spinal injury site. Immunohistochemistry for GFAP at the site of spina injury confirmed lesion depth in all animals, and in the dorsal cord tdTomato and CTB-488 signal was confined to tissue rostral to the injury, indicating complete ablation of dorsal axon tracts (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-1" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5A-E</xref></bold>).

In pilot studies we discovered that unlike cervical injections, lumbar injection of AAV2-Retro required a full four weeks to achieve adequate expression level, and accordingly survival times were increased from two weeks to four.

We did not observe any CST neurons that were double-labeled, and no tdTomato+ neurons were located in secondary sensory cortex or in the rostral forelimb area, emphasizing the presence of neurons with projections to only lumbar or cervical cord. Similarly, in the red nucleus, cervically-versus lumbar-labeled neurons segregated into two discrete populations, with the lumbar-projecting neurons located lateral to the cervical population with very few double labelled neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">Flumerfelt and Gwyn, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">Liang et al., 2012a</xref>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-8" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7J</xref>, Supp. Movie 7</bold>).

We initially delivered clozapine IP at a concentration of 0.1mg/kg, a concentration reported to achieve effective DREADD activation, and observed animals in open field locomotion. Within 5 minutes, animals displayed clear changes in forelimb movement, with a disappearance of plantar placement and the emergence of weight-bearing steps on the curled dorsal surface (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-2" hwp:rel-id="F8">Fig. 8B</xref></bold>). Within 15 minutes, weight bearing steps by forelimbs were absent and limbs were pinned beneath the torso. Careful examination showed small, non-effective movements is some animals, and no forelimb movement in others. By two hours after injection, most animals returned to weight-bearing steps with non-plantar placement, and by five hours showed near-normal locomotion with only occasional non-plantar placement (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-3" hwp:rel-id="F8">Fig. 8B,C</xref></bold>). To quantify these effects, we established a simple five-point motor scale from 5 (normal forelimb stepping), 4 (occasional non-plantar steps) 3 (weight bearing steps but completely non-plantar), 2 (no weight bearing steps but occasional large sweeping movements for forward propulsion), 1 (limb predominantly immobile but occasional small movements) and 0 (no discernable movement). We administered a range of clozapine doses, taking advantage of the reversibility of the effects to test a different dose each day. At 0.01mg/kg, clozapine produced only a partial loss of plantar placement, and at 0.05mg/kg a complete loss of plantar placement but still some weight support. Clozapine at concentrations of 0.1mg/kg and 0.2mg/kg produced similar curves, with maximal impairment at 15 minutes post-injection (0.90 (±0.34SEM) and 0.95(±0.39SEM), respectively). These data establish a dose-response curve for clozapine-mediated DREADD activation, with maximal effects achieved at 0.1mg/kg.

Here we found that spinal injection of AAV2-Retro in adult animals transduces CST neurons with more than 95% efficiency. Fluorophore expression is quite strong, requires no antibody amplification, and can be visualized within days of injection. AAV2-Retro thus stands out as a powerful new tool for gene delivery to supraspinal populations, including CST.</p><p hwp:id="p-37">AAV2-Retro was not as effective in labeling some supraspinal neurons.

Surprisingly, AAV2-Retro also displayed relatively low efficiency in propriospinal neurons.

For example, in experimental brain syndromes such as stroke, traumatic brain injury and genetic diseases that involve descending motor pathways, this approach could clarify when and where axonal abnormalities originate, while quantifying in an unbiased way neurons that maintain intact connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">Carron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">Sommer et al., 2017</xref>). Variable sparing of axons often complicates spinal injury experiments, and thus one application of this technique would be to immediately supply AAV2-Retro distal to injury site, followed by 3D imaging throughout the brain to rapidly quantify the distribution of virally labeled (spared) axons and neurons.</p><p hwp:id="p-39">Injection of AAV2-Retro to cervical spinal cord supplies all branches with cytoplasm-filling fluorophores, and thus another important use for this combined approach is to clarify points of collateralization along descending axon tracts. Collateral branching has important implications for motor control (e.g. pontine collaterals from CST axons likely provide a copy of descending motor commands to the cerebellar circuits via ponto-cerebellar projections), as well as for regenerative growth. When neurons maintain spared axon branches proximal to injury sites, regenerative growth is diminished compared o injury conditions in which no proximal branches are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">Lorenzana et al., 2015</xref>).

These branches may stabilize CST axons and perhaps hinder a regenerative response after spinal injury. In this context, it may be interesting to inject AAV2-Retro to various collateral targets in the brain, specifically labeling the corresponding axons in the spinal cord, and compare regenerative growth according the presence of spared collaterals.</p><p hwp:id="p-40">An overall limitation for the use of light-sheet microscopy regards spatial resolution. Light-sheet microscopy at the centimeter level, detects bundles of axons more effectively than individual thin axons, which may explain why single-cell reconstruction indicates CST collaterals to the medulla that are not detected here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Economo et al., 2016</xref>). It is likely that the CST-medulla collaterals exist, but that light-sheet microscopy cannot resolve the individual branches from CST fibers, particularly as they pass near other supraspinal cell bodies and tracts. Transgenic targeting approaches that label only CST axons and remove non-CST fluorescence from brainstem tissue, combined with traditional sectioning and confocal microscopy, would likely reveal additional CST collaterals in brainstem tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s5c" hwp:id="sec-18"><title hwp:id="title-19">AAV2-Retro as a tool for functional dissection of supraspinal motor control</title><p hwp:id="p-41">Descending motor control signals arise from coordinated activity in widely distributed brain nuclei, and are delivered to the spinal cord in discrete axon tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Esposito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Lemon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Lemon and Griffiths, 2005</xref>). To distinguish their function, a classic method is to monitor motor deficits that follow transection of specific supraspinal tracts. This approach has yielded important insights, for example the partially redundant contributions of corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts to fine motor control in the forelimb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Kanagal and Muir, 2009</xref>). A major limitation, however, is the difficulty in specifically ablating tracts by surgical means. Indeed, the CST has been among the most studied sources of supraspinal control in part because it is a tractable system for selective ablation in the medullary pyramids. Such selective ablation is not possible for most other tracts, and even in the case of the CST the full transections can’t parse functions from discrete CST sub-regions. As an alternative, direct injection of toxins or GABA agonists can ablate or silence cell bodies in supraspinal nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Esposito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">Z’Graggen et al., 2000</xref>). This approach, however, is complicated by issues of specificity, as it is difficult to control the spread of injected compounds to adjacent and intermingled off-target neurons.</p><p hwp:id="p-42">To circumvent these limitations, researchers are increasingly turning to so-called intersectional genetic approaches to silence or kill specific subsets of supraspinal neurons. This strategy involves injection of a retrograde construct encoding Cre recombinase to the spinal cord, accompanied by delivery of Cre-dependent constructs to the cell bodies of origin. In this way, only spinally-projecting neurons in the vicinity of the brain injection, and not off-target cells, express the transgene. This approach was used to selectively kill CST neurons in the rostral or caudal forelimb region, revealing differential contributions to reaching versus grasping components of a pellet retrieval motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).

We found that retrograde delivery of Gi-DREADD to supraspinal neurons causes dramatic and reversible forelimb paralysis, equivalent to the motor effects of a complete spinal transection. Although our expression analysis revealed that AAV2-Retro is not perfectly efficient and that some supraspinal neurons escape silencing, their activity was insufficient to achieve movement, highlighting the broad efficacy of AAV2-Retro-DREADD. Importantly, this finding indicates that AAV2-Retro is a suitable platform for two complementary types of experiments. Similar to prior work, Cre-dependent Retro-AAV can be paired with Cre driver lines to probe the necessity of selected supraspinal populations for normal movement. As proof of principle, we confirmed that cortically enriched Gi-DREADD expression causes behavioral deficits that are consistent with selective removal of CST input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">Starkey et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it appears that Retro-AAV would now enable the complementary experiment to test the sufficiency of individual tracts to evoke movements. By supplying “Cre-off” RETRO-Gi-DREADD to the spinal cord, while also supplying particular supraspinal regions with Cre (by AAV injection or transgenic means), specific populations could be selectively protected in the context of overall silencing. Indeed, a key question in regeneration research is what percent of descending neurons, and what type of neurons, must regenerate after injury in order to carry effective movement. By delivering Cre to different supraspinal locations, it will be possible to control the type and percent of descending axons that escape silencing, and in this way prove their specific contributions. In summary, AAV2-Retro represents an important new tool for the functional dissection of supraspinal control of movement under physiologic and pathological conditions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec
