Although some pharmacological agents are known to alter social behavior, precise description and quantification of such effects have proven difficult. The complexity of brain functions regulating sociality makes it challenging to predict drug effects on social behavior without testing in live animals, and most existing behavioral assays are low-throughput and provide only unidimensional readouts of social function. To achieve richer characterization of drug effects on sociality, we developed a scalable social behavioral assay for zebrafish named ZeChat based on unsupervised deep learning. High-dimensional and dynamic social behavioral phenotypes are automatically classified using this method. By screening a neuroactive compound library, we found that different classes of chemicals evoke distinct patterns of social behavioral fingerprints. By examining these patterns, we discovered that dopamine D3 agonists possess a social stimulative effect on zebrafish. The D3 agonists pramipexole, piribedil, and 7-hydroxy-DPAT-HBr rescued social deficits in a valproic acid-induced zebrafish autism model. The ZeChat platform provides a promising approach for dissecting the pharmacology of social behavior and discovering novel social-modulatory compounds.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="26"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta hwp:id="custom-meta-1"><meta-name>special-property</meta-name><meta-value>contains-inline-supplementary-material</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta-wrap>

In humans, social dysfunction is a hallmark of several neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Williams syndrome, to name a few. In particular, social communication impairment is considered a core symptom of autism. Despite its importance, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how the diverse classes of neuroactive drugs impact social behavior. This is evidenced by the fact that although certain antipsychotics, antidepressants, and stimulants medications are used clinically to help manage some symptoms of autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup>, no treatment is currently available to ameliorate the disease-relevant social deficit.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">It has been a major challenge to comprehensively assess and compare how chemicals affect complex behaviors such as sociality. Simple <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> assays cannot effectively model drug effects on whole organisms, especially on brain activity. Rodent models lack sufficient throughput and are cost-prohibitive for a comprehensive examination of the hundreds of neuroactive drugs currently available, limiting their uses to small-scale hypothesis-driven testing. On the other hand, the zebrafish has become an increasingly important model organism for social behavioral research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref></sup>, and recent developments in zebrafish behavioral profiling have demonstrated a promising alternative approach to meeting this challenge. Indeed, multidimensional behavioral profiling in zebrafish has been used to systematically assess thousands of chemicals for effects on motor responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup>, rest/wake behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup>, and appetite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">Current methods of social behavioral analysis in zebrafish are mostly limited to quantifying the average measurement of a human-defined simplex trait such as social preference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref></sup>, social orienting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref></sup>, and group cohesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref></sup>, or a collection of several simplex traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref></sup>, with limited throughput. Restricted by their unidimensional nature, these measurements often fail to adequately represent the complex and multidimensional nature of social behavior in space and time. To comprehensively assess social behavior for behavioral profiling, we sought to develop an automated method to classify the real-time dynamics of social behavior based solely on information provided by the data, without any human intervention, in a scalable format. To achieve this goal, we adopted an unsupervised deep learning approach: deep learning based on a convolutional autoencoder can automatically extract social-relevant features from a behavioral recording, while unsupervised learning allows for unbiased classification of real-time behavioral phenotypes; both processes were conducted free of human instructions.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Here, we report a fully automated and scalable social behavioral profiling platform named ZeChat. Built on an unsupervised deep learning backbone, ZeChat embeds the high-dimensional and dynamical social behavioral data into a 2-dimensional space and assigns the embedded datapoints to distinct behavioral categories, thus converting a fish’s entire social behavioral recording to a behavioral fingerprint in the form of a numerical vector. Screening 237 known neuroactive compounds using the ZeChat system generated a rich set of social-relevant behavioral phenotypes which enabled unbiased clustering and classification of drug-treated animals. Based on the social behavioral profile compiled from the screen, we discovered a social stimulative effect of dopamine D3 receptor agonists (D3 agonists). Acute exposure to D3 agonists rescued social deficits in a valproic acid-induced zebrafish autism model. Our results demonstrate that multidimensional social behavioral phenotypes can be distilled into simple behavioral fingerprints to classify the effect of psychotropic chemicals on sociality.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-4">RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-5">Rationale and overview of the ZeChat behavioral analysis framework</title><p hwp:id="p-9">The ZeChat workflow is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1a</xref>. We probed social interaction in a 2-chamber setup, in which each fish swims freely in a square arena with visual access to its partner fish through a transparent window. In this setup, a fish’s position inside the arena, as well as its posture and movement dynamics, were deemed relevant for social interaction. Inspired by Berman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup>, we sought to describe social behavior as a point moving through a high-dimensional space of positional, postural, and motional features, and to assign segmented subspaces to sub-behaviors. First, a preprocessing step distilled social-relevant information from the recorded images. A convolutional autoencoder then unbiasedly extracted key features from the preprocessed images to a latent vector, which is then projected onto its first 40 principal components. We converted the time series of each principal component to a wavelet spectrogram to incorporate behavioral dynamics into a feature vector.

These prerequisites are not always met, especially when faced with complex problems such as analyzing subtle behavioral changes in a video or analyzing sequences of behaviors, as it is difficult for a human observer to exhaustively extract useful features from an image or a sequence of images. Deep learning methods, on the other hand, can automatically learn to extract abstract features from images. As behavioral recordings are sequences of images, the potential benefit for applying deep learning to process these data is apparent. In fact, several recent studies have successfully utilized deep learning to facilitate individual animal identification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">47</xref></sup>, tracking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">48</xref></sup>, and movement prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">49</xref></sup> in zebrafish, paving the way for its application in ZeChat.</p><p hwp:id="p-31">In alignment with our findings, the D3 receptor has been previously implicated in social behavioral regulation.

Further investigations are needed to validate these findings in rodents using other D3 agonists and under different test conditions, drug doses, and genetic backgrounds of the animals, but the results in zebrafish, rats, and humans all point to an important role of D3 receptors in modulating social behavior. In addition, because both pramipexole and piribedil are FDA-approved antiparkinsonian agents, it may be worthwhile examining their impact on the social behavior of patients receiving these drugs.</p><p hwp:id="p-32">Future studies using the ZeChat platform may expand to screening other neuroactive compounds, compounds with no known neuroactivity, and uncharacterized compounds, in the hope of identifying additional phenotypes and drug classes with social-modulatory properties. The characteristic behavioral fingerprint of the D3 agonists may be used to discover novel compounds with similar behavioral effects. In addition to wild type fish, fish carrying mutations relevant to human psychiatric disorders can also be assayed, and their behavioral fingerprints compared to the neuroactive compound clustergram to associate genetic mutations with perturbations of neuronal pathways. As demonstrated by Hoffman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53" hwp:id="xref-ref-53-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-53">53</xref></sup>, small molecules evoking an anti-correlated behavioral fingerprint may ameliorate social deficits in the mutant fish.

The printed test arena was glued onto a 3/16” thick white translucent (43% light transmission) acrylic sheet (US Plastic) using a silicone sealer (Marineland). Each unit was then divided into two square-shaped compartments by inserting a 1.5 mm thick transparent acrylic window – precision cut to 10 mm x 41 mm pieces using a laser cutter – into 0.5 mm deep printed slots located in the middle of each unit on the side of the 41.5 mm wall and fastened using the silicone sealer.</p><p hwp:id="p-34">The key component of the imaging system is a 322 mm diameter bi-telecentric lens (Opto Engineering) with an IR (850 nm) bandpass filter (Opto Engineering).

The imaging platform was back-illuminated with an infrared (850 nm) LED array (EnvironmentalLights) to provide light for video recording. The infrared LED array was positioned on top of a heat sink (H S Marston). The imaging platform was also illuminated from two opposing sides using white LED arrays (EnvironmentalLights) to provide ambient light for the test subjects.

We then applied principal component analysis (PCA) to this 784-dimensional feature vector and extracted 40 principal components which preserved ~ 95% of total variance.</p></sec><sec id="s4e" hwp:id="sec-16"><title hwp:id="title-24">Time-frequency analysis of feature dynamics</title><p hwp:id="p-41">Calculating the 40 principal components for each video frame yields 40 timeseries for each video. Each timeseries was then expanded into a spectrogram by applying the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). The Morlet wavelet was used as the mother wavelet and 25 scales were chosen to match frequencies spanning from 0.38 Hz to 5 Hz, with the range of frequencies empirically determined to preserve the strongest signals. The time-frequency representation augments the instantaneous representation by capturing oscillations across many timescales. The spectral amplitudes of each time point were then concatenated into a vector of length 40 × 25, giving rise to a 1,000-dimensional representation for each original video frame. Each 1,000-dimensional vector was normalized to having a sum of 1 in order to treat each vector as a probability distribution for subsequent calculation.</p></sec><sec id="s4f" hwp:id="sec-17"><title hwp:id="title-25">Nonlinear embedding and segmentation</title><p hwp:id="p-42">We then performed nonlinear dimensionality reduction on these high dimensional vectors using the popular nonlinear manifold embedding algorithm <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-SNE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref></sup>.

Due to computational limitations, this calculation was conducted using a ZeChat map containing 10,000 randomly selected datapoints.

Finally, a watershed transform was applied to mark the borders between each valley to unbiasedly segment the ZeChat map into 80 behavioral categories.</p><p hwp:id="p-44">For ZeChat analysis, to reduce computation time, we randomly sampled 5000 frames from each fish for kernel <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-SNE embedding and subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4g" hwp:id="sec-18"><title hwp:id="title-26">Behavioral fingerprint calculation and hierarchical clustering</title><p hwp:id="p-45">Each frame is assigned a watershed region (behavioral category) based on ZeChat map segmentation. For each fish, the total number of frames assigned to each watershed region was counted, giving rise to a behavioral fingerprint in the form of an 80-dimensional vector. Behavioral fingerprints of fish treated by each drug were combined into one fingerprint by calculating the median of each behavioral category. All combined raw behavioral fingerprints were normalized so that the signals of each behavioral category were between 0 and 1. To help visualize the difference in behavioral patterns between drug treatments and DMSO control, we calculated the median of each behavioral category of all DMSO controls to generate a representative fingerprint for DMSO control, and subtracted this fingerprint from all drug treatment samples. Finally, the normalized and DMSO-subtracted fingerprints of each drug treatment were clustered using the clustermap function (metric=‘euclidean’, method=’complete’) of Python’s Seaborn library.</p></sec><sec id="s4h" hwp:id="sec-19"><title hwp:id="title-27">Zebrafish chemical treatment and screening</title><p hwp:id="p-46">For ZeChat testing, 21 dpf zebrafish were collected from nursery tanks.
