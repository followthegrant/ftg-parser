The lowest p53 levels occur in unstressed cells; however, the impact of these low levels on cell integrity remains unclear. To address the impact, we used single-cell tracking of p53-expressing and silenced cells, and developed a fate-simulation algorithm. Here we show that p53-silenced cells underwent more frequent aberrant events, suggesting that the levels of p53 indeed have a role to maintain the integrity of a cell population. However, p53-silenced cells were unable to propagate in a virtual p53-expressing cell population. In contrast, when damage responses were repeatedly induced in p53-expressed cells, p53-silenced cells became a dominant cell population. In this context, p53-mediated damage response that is supposed to suppress tumor formation has a pro-malignant function. The fate of cancer cells could, thus, be influenced by their microenvironment and our system can be used to reveal the fate.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="76"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta hwp:id="custom-meta-1"><meta-name>special-property</meta-name><meta-value>contains-inline-supplementary-material</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta-wrap>

The p53 levels are regulated via a mechanism mediated by Mdm2, which constantly degrades p53 by ubiquitination to maintain a low level until the cells are exposed to stress, when p53 accumulates as a result of its stabilization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that increased stress levels are required to elevate p53 levels sufficiently to allow it to exert its tumor suppressor function. Maintaining a background low level of p53 may thus have evolved as a means of allowing cells to respond quickly to stress. Alternatively, given that removing p53 by gene silencing increases the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref></sup>, maintaining a low level of p53 in unstressed cells <italic toggle="yes">per se</italic> may have functional implications. With this regard, it has been suggested that low levels of p53 activity may require normal cell growth to respond to a broad spectrum of stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref></sup> through suppression of apoptosis and regulation of metabolisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref></sup>. However, the function of maintaining low levels of p53 in unstressed cells remains unclear.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">Here, we investigated the effects of low levels of p53 on the behavior of cells using empirical single-cell tracking, to quantitatively evaluate the frequencies of cellular events, i.e. cell death (CD), aberrant cell divisions, and cell fusions (CF), which are difficult to be detected by lineage-reconstruction approaches that assume all cell divisions to be bipolar <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, to follow the fate of individual cells in a cell population, we developed a cell-fate simulation algorithm based on empirical single-cell tracking data. Our results suggest that the low levels of p53 in unstressed cells indeed have a role to maintain the integrity of a cell population, thereby leading p53-silenced cells to aberrant cellular events. A cell-fate simulation analysis revealed that those p53-silenced cells were unable to propagate. In contrast, in the condition where DNA damage was repeatedly introduced to a cell population composed of 4% p53-silenced cells and 96% of p53-proficient cells, p53-silenced cells became the major cell population. In this context, damage response that is supposed to suppress tumor formation is instead involved in a pro-malignant process. The fate of cancer cells could thus be influenced by their complex microenvironment and our system could be used to reveal the unexpected fate of cancer cells in the environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-5">RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-6">System to investigate the functional implications of maintaining a low level of p53 in unstressed cells</title><p hwp:id="p-8">We developed a system to determine if the low level of p53 retained in unstressed cells had a functional role in maintaining the integrity of a cell population.

Responses of cells to MNNG were also monitored by concurrent video recording. To start tracking individual cells, progenitors were selected in video images at a tracking time of 0 min, and empirical single-cell tracking of progenitors and their progeny was performed by identifying cellular events including bipolar cell division (BD), tripolar cell division, tetrapolar cell division (tripolar and tetrapolar divisions were defined as multipolar division, MD), CD, and CF (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-1" hwp:rel-id="F8">Fig. S1a</xref> for still images of BD, MD, CD and CF).

To this end, images were divided into 5 × 5 squares (∼512 × 512 pixels per square) and the number of cells within a square was determined at 1,000-min intervals. We used three independently generated videos with multiple squares from each. The results of counting the cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (Control) and p53 siRNA (p53si) are summarized in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-2" hwp:rel-id="F2">b</xref>, respectively.

This allowed us to determine which progenitors, i.e. highly or poorly reproductive ones, contributed to the maintenance of the cell population. In Control cells, the main cells contributing to maintaining the cell population were progenitors that produced 7–9 progeny (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-13" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2m</xref>).

For example, suppression of population expansion in cells exposed to 3 or 7 µM MNNG could be explained by a reduction in progenitors that produced e.g. 7–9 progeny.

To this end, we first visually inspected each time point of the video image and counted the number of events, in addition to analysis using a cell-lineage database. CF tends to occur gradually and was therefore difficult to detect without single-cell tracking analysis, and only MD and CD events were counted by visual inspection. Each time point of the video image was divided into four squares (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3" hwp:id="xref-fig-10-1" hwp:rel-id="F10">Fig. S3a</xref>) and the numbers of CD and MD events in each square were marked in three independently generated videos.

MD density maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3" hwp:id="xref-fig-10-2" hwp:rel-id="F10">Fig. S3b</xref>) showed that p53 silencing significantly increased MD density relative to Control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3" hwp:id="xref-fig-10-3" hwp:rel-id="F10">Fig. S3b</xref>), and MD density was reduced by MNNG treatment.

We analyzed the results statistically, and confirmed that p53 silencing significantly increased MD events, and this was counteracted by MNNG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-1" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The p53 silencing also significantly induced CD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-2" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), and this was further promoted by exposure to 7 µM MNNG. Single-cell tracking analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-4" hwp:rel-id="F3">d</xref>) yielded consistent results with counting. With regard to the induction of CD by 7 µM MNNG, the difference in number of CD events between the Control and MNNG7 cells determined by counting was higher than that determined by single-cell tracking analysis. This was because the area of single-cell tracking was slightly outside the area where CDs frequently occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3" hwp:id="xref-fig-10-5" hwp:rel-id="F10">Fig. S3c</xref>). Detection of CF required the fused cells to be followed-up for at least 30 time points (∼5 h) to confirm the occurrence of CF, and single-cell tracking analysis also revealed that silencing p53 increased the frequency of CF, and this was counteracted by MNNG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-5" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that the low levels of p53 retained in unstressed cells function to suppress MD, CD, and CF, and these events were thus induced following p53 silencing.

The growth of p53-expressing cells was maintained by strongly biasing their division to BD, and less frequently by the induction of other events, i.e. CD, MD, and CF. On the other hand, silencing of p53 led to frequent induction of CD in p53-silenced cells. Such CD appears to occur by a process distinct from damage-induced CD, and CD occurring in p53-silenced cells may be induced as a natural defense mechanism to remove cells lacking p53. Indeed, fate simulation in a population containing 4% p53-silenced and 96% p53-expressing cells demonstrated that expansion of the p53-silenced cells was suppressed by p53-expressing cells, and the induction of CD in p53-silenced cells hindered their expansion. After ∼21 cell doublings of 500 progenitors including 4% of p53-silenced cells, the cell number increased to ∼1 × 10<sup>9</sup>, corresponding to ∼1 cm of cancer tissue mass, while the relative content of p53-silenced cells was reduced to 1.2% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-10" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7o</xref>). In this context, the expansion of p53-silenced cells with malignant potential was suppressed by p53-expressing cells, making p53-silenced cells effectively dormant cells.

Nevertheless, we demonstrated that silencing p53 in unstressed cells led to CF followed by MD. Furthermore, our simulation results suggest that the aneuploid progeny produced by MD can generate a cell population, implying the addition of genetic diversity to a cell population. As previously suggested <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref></sup>, the ability of p53 to suppress tumor formation may be related to the normal growth of cells, and the formation may be related to non-mutagenic mechanisms of cancer development as exemplified by extrachromosomal DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52" hwp:id="xref-ref-52-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-52">52</xref></sup>. However, the addition of genetic diversity to a cell population <italic toggle="yes">per se</italic> may not be sufficient to overcome the cell population homeostasis barrier established by p53-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-12" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7o</xref>), and other events that trigger the expansion of p53-silenced cells may be required during tumorigenesis.</p><p hwp:id="p-45">Induction of the damage response in p53-expressing cells could be one such event. Our simulation results suggested that 4% of p53-silenced cells in the p53-expressing cell population expanded to 11% following virtual exposure to 7 µM MNNG at a simulation time of 20,000 min (13.9 days). After repeating this exposure four times (40,000 min), the simulation revealed that p53-silenced cells accounted for 93% of the cell population (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-13" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7o</xref>). The DNA damage response is supposed to suppress tumor formation, but in the current context, it could have a pro-malignant function.

Furthermore, the level of stress, e.g. DNA damage, caused by the cellular microenvironment could add another layer of complexity. To understand the process of tumorigenesis, these complexities need to be resolved. In this regard, cell-fate simulation algorithms could be used to resolve the complexity. Performing these simulations requires the creation of a cell-lineage database, and we estimated that the database generated by monitoring two cell divisions of 100 progenitors would be sufficient to simulate cell growth. Furthermore, because each cell line is likely to have unique growth characteristics and response patterns to treatment, once a cell-lineage database representing a specific growth characteristic or response pattern is archived, it can be used as a new public resource for cell biology and cancer research to predict and analyze the role of a cell in cancer development, and eventually to reveal the process of tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-22"><title hwp:id="title-32">EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec id="s4a" hwp:id="sec-23"><title hwp:id="title-33">Cells and cell culture</title><p hwp:id="p-47">A549-luc-C8 cells were purchased from Xenogen Corporation and cultured in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

In the simulation arrays corresponding to the Time dataset, this was converted to, e.g. 20, 20, 20, 20. If no corresponding type of event occurred, the array for the event held no data. To generate a simulation array for the Event dataset, the percentage of each event relative to the total number of cell divisions (total of BD and MD) was calculated. The maximum number of entries per array was 100. The total percentage of events could thus exceed 100, e.g. first event list (BD, CD, MD, and the number of cells with no cell division (nonDiv)). In this case, the percentage of each event was adjusted to make a total of 100. If the percentage of the event was &lt;100, 0 was filled to make the total entry for the array 100. If no corresponding type of event occurred, an array for the event held no data. The Recovery percentage was calculated as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4h" hwp:id="sec-30"><title hwp:id="title-40">Cell-fate simulation algorithm: Initial Evt and event-type assignment</title><p hwp:id="p-55">In the first event assignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4" hwp:id="xref-fig-11-28" hwp:rel-id="F11">Fig. S4d</xref>), the CDE that held the status of each cell throughout a simulation was created. In this step, the cell-lineage number was generated following the initial number of cells set previously, and the cell number 0 was assigned to each progenitor. Using the FirstEvent array, Evt was then assigned to each cell. If the array was empty, the average time that BD occurred was calculated and −25% to +25% of the time selected by random number was assigned as Evt, and BD was then assigned to the cell. If the FirstEvent array held data, Evt was assigned by creating a random number, but if Evt was equal to the length of single-cell tracking, −30% to +30% of the length of the time of single-cell tracking was assigned as Evt and the event type was selected using the FirstEvent list array.

If the current event in a cell was NonDiv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4" hwp:id="xref-fig-11-32" hwp:rel-id="F11">Fig. S4f</xref>, 1), a randomized number between 0 and 100 was generated, and if the number was lower than the Recovery %, BD was assigned to the cell. In the next cycle, this cell was entered into a growing cycle. If the Evt was 80%–100% of the length of the single-cell tracking time, the Evt was determined by generating random numbers between 80 and 100. Assignment of BD in this manner only occurred once at the first cycle of the assignment. If the random value was higher than the Recovery %, either NonDiv or CD was assigned, in which case the % of CD of total cell division was calculated and, if the random number between 0 and 100 was lower than the CD%, a CD was assigned.
