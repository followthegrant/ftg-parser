CRISPR-Cas9 has greatly facilitated this strategy, but some standard approaches are problematic. For instance, simple tissue-specific or global overexpression of Cas9 can cause significant lethality or developmental delays even in the absence of gRNAs. In particular, we found that Gal4-mediated expression of UAS-Cas9 in the <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> prothoracic gland (PG) was not a suitable strategy to disrupt gene expression, since Cas9 alone caused widespread lethality. The PG gland is widely used for studying endocrine gland function during animal development, but tools validating PG-specific RNAi phenotypes are lacking. Here, we present a collection of modular gateway-compatible CRISPR-Cas9 tools that allow precise modulation of target gene activity with temporal and spatial specificity. We also demonstrate that Cas9 fused to the progesterone ligand-binding domain can be used to activate gene expression via RU486. Using these approaches, we were able to avoid the lethality associated with simple GAL4-mediated overexpression of Cas9 in the PG. Given that the PG is a polytene tissue, we conclude that these tools work effectively in endoreplicating cells where Cas9 has to target multiple copies of the same locus. Our toolkit can be easily adapted for other tissues and can be used both for gain-and loss-of-function studies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="52"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Introduction</title><p hwp:id="p-3">It is crucial to have the ability to conditionally manipulate the activity of genes, be it to overcome embryonic lethality of null mutants to study later roles of a given gene, distinguish between cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms, or to study tissue-specific gene functions. In Drosophila, the standard techniques for conditionally altering gene function have been RNA interference (RNAi) to block or impair gene activity and the overexpression of cDNAs for gain-of-function studies. Most commonly, both RNAi and cDNA expression are temporally controlled via the Gal4-UAS system, resulting in a highly versatile set of tools. However, each of these commonly used components has its limitations and downsides. In particular, RNAi suffers from the frequent occurrence of off-targets, requiring rigorous validation, and often the expression of a target mRNA is only partially blocked. In addition, combining two or more RNAi transgenes to test for synthetic lethality or interaction of pathway components is cumbersome and exponentially increases the risk of non-specific effects. On the other hand, to achieve overexpression of a gene of interest, traditional cDNA overexpression requires the cloning of a full-length cDNA, which may be difficult and time-consuming. Further, in the case of alternatively spliced genes, one usually has to choose which isoform to use for the transgenic cDNA line, which may limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment. It should also be noted that the use of Gal4 itself has its drawbacks. In particular, Gal4 may result in signal amplification due to its strong activation domain, and one has only limited control over how strongly a given cDNA is expressed. Further, UAS-regulated transgenes all show some degree of leakiness, depending on the tissue and developmental time, potentially confounding experimental outcomes (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">Akmammedov et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, the presence of a second unrelated UAS-transgene may alter phenotypes seen with a single UAS-transgene alone, as both compete for Gal4-binding, which may quench the expression of either transgene. Finally, Gal4 binds non-specifically to endogenous loci, resulting in the up-and down-regulation of hundreds of genes, which may complicate the interpretation of genome-wide gene expression studies (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">Liu and Lehmann, 2008</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-4">The recent discovery of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and the generation of guide RNA- (gRNA-) dependent Cas9 endonucleases has been quickly adapted by Drosophila researchers (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Gratz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">Port et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">Lin et al., 2015</xref>) and we now possess a universal and powerful toolkit that can be used for both loss- and gain-of-function studies by using distinct versions of Cas9 (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Gupta and Musunuru, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Bier et al., 2018</xref>). As such, CRISPR-based techniques are ideal to replace, validate and complement traditional approaches relying on conditionally expressing RNAi or cDNAs.

However, a frequent issue in the follow-up studies was that we could not validate the RNAi-induced phenotypes by independent non-overlapping RNAi lines, either because no such lines existed or because independent lines did not replicate the phenotype. This prompted us to look into CRISPR-based methods that could be used to confirm the RNAi results. However, no studies have addressed whether somatic CRISPR is feasible in the PG, nor have there been any reports on the usage of tissue-specific CRISPR/CAS9 for other commonly studied polytene tissues such as the larval fat body and the salivary glands. Previous studies have established that somatic CRISPR/CAS9 is highly efficient in disrupting genes in a biallelic fashion, however endoreplicating tissues such as the salivary gland contain up to 1024 copies of a gene (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Hochstrasser, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">Andrew et al., 2000</xref>) raising the question as to whether CRISPR/CAS9 would be effective in polytene tissues. Furthermore, our initial attempts to express Cas9 via the most commonly used PG-specific Gal4 drivers resulted in substantial larval lethality, which rendered this approach impractical. We therefore developed several strategies that induced tissue-specific CRISPR/CAS9 without using Gal4.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;354258v1/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><title hwp:id="title-3">Somatic CRISPR in the <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> prothoracic gland.</title><p hwp:id="p-6">In Drosophila larvae, the prothoracic gland (PG) is the principal source for ecdysteroid production.

These new tools have in common that they are not based on Gal4, but rather use enhancer regions to achieve tissue-specific expression of Cas9 or gRNAs. This greatly simplifies the genetics of tissue-specific CRISPR/Cas9, since one only requires a single cross to build the CRISPR/CAS9-gRNA combination, while the Gal4-UAS-based approach requires combining at least three transgenes. Importantly, we show that the lethality associated with Gal4-driven Cas9 can be prevented by several strategies, including tissue-specific expression of gRNAs coupled with ubiquitously expressed Cas9. To accomplish tissue-specific gRNA production, we took advantage of inserting ribozyme sequences, which demonstrates for the first time in Drosophila the that ribozymes can be used to effectively release gRNAs from mRNAs. We also present the first fusion of Cas9 with the Ligand-binding domain of the human progesterone receptor and demonstrate that it is a highly effective tool for achieving both temporal and spatial control over Cas9-mediated gene activation. We evaluated the efficiency of each tool by targeting two well-studied genes acting in ecdysone biosynthesis, <italic toggle="yes">phantom</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">disembodied</italic>. Finally, we provide a general, gateway-based vector collection (gG-Cas9) that allows the quick generation of seven different Cas9-based vectors.

FokI.dCas9 is a fusion of dCas9 with the nuclease domain of FokI and designed to cut target DNA upon dimerization of the FokI nuclease domain (requires two gRNAs ~ 15-25 bp apart). dCas9 is designed for transcription interference (CRISPRi), where promoter-bound dCas9 will not cut DNA but rather sterically inhibit the proper formation of the pre-initiation complex. Taken together, this set of modified Gateway plasmids can be easily adapted to generate specific enhancer/Cas9 combinations, followed by PhiC31-mediated locus-specific transformation.

We therefore generated PG-specific versions of dCas9, to which we fused the VP64 or VPR activation domains (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">Dominguez et al., 2016</xref>), named here spok64b and spokVPR (short for spokdCas9-VP64b and spokdCas9-VPR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-3" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).

However, the dCas9-VP64 construct only contained two nuclease-attenuating mutations D10A and H840A compared to the dCas9-VPR, which contained four (D10A, H839A, H840A and N863A). We therefore modified the original <italic toggle="yes">dCas9-VP64</italic> to <italic toggle="yes">dCas9-VP64b</italic>, so that it contained the same four nuclease-attenuating mutations as the <italic toggle="yes">dCas9-VPR</italic> construct.</p><p hwp:id="p-24">We first examined the efficiency of the <italic toggle="yes">spok64</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">spok64b</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">spokVPR</italic> constructs by transfecting cultured brain-ring gland complexes (BRGC) that carried gRNA transgenes targeting either the <italic toggle="yes">phm</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">dib</italic> promoters upstream of the TSS, which were the same lines as used for CRISPRi.

In the approaches outlined above, we employed PG-specific Cas9 expression. We therefore tested whether reversing gRNA and Cas9 expression patterns from tissue-specific to ubiquitous (and vice versa) was a viable strategy, because an existing line with ubiquitous Cas9 expression was reported to be homozygous viable (Bloomington stock #58590). A previous study described using UAS-driven multiplexed gRNA cloned into pCFD6 (Addgene 73915) to mediate tissue-specific gRNA expression in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> imaginal wing discs (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>).

We have generated a series of strategies to solve this problem, which now allows somatic generation of DSBs, CRISPRi and CRISPRa. Generating tissue-specific gRNAs is also a viable strategy, provided ubiquitously expressed Cas9 levels are sufficiently low to avoid lethality. Since endoreplicating tissues harbor multiple copies of the same locus, Cas9 should be activated early enough to ensure efficient gene disruption. In our hands, somatic gRNAs work even better than RNAi lines, and appear to be highly specific, indicating that polytene tissues pose no issue for somatic CRISPR approaches. Even though we generated tools for PG-specific CRISPR, our tools can be used for any tissue of interest, polytene or not.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-24">Acknowledgements</title><p hwp:id="p-34">We thank Norbert Perrimon, Simon Bullock, Gerald Rubin and Michael O’Connor for sharing the original plasmids used in this study.
