Specifically, a reduction of the fear response is considered a key component, with domesticated animals expressing lower levels of fear towards novelty than their wild counterparts. Previous work has suggested that this is caused by a delay in the onset of fearful behaviour during early ontogeny in domesticated canids. However, it remains unclear how the developmental timing of initial fear expression affects fearfulness later in development. Here we present the first extended examination of the development of fear behaviour in wolves and dogs, using repeated novel object tests between six and 26 weeks of age. Contrary to expectations, fear of novelty did not change in wolves with age, but dogs expressed decreased latency to approach a novel object with age, resulting in a species difference at the end of the measured period. Our results thereby suggest that differences in fear of novelty between wolves and dogs are not caused by a domestication driven shift in the first onset of fear response. Instead we suggest that differences in fear expression between wolves and dogs are caused by a loss of sensitivity towards novelty with age in dogs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Key words</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">Fear</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">domestication</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">sensitive period</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">ontogeny</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">novel object test</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-6">Canis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="20"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-3">Introduction</title><p hwp:id="p-3">Abundant evidence demonstrates how domesticated plants and animals express dramatically altered phenotypes compared to their wild counterparts (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>). For animals, it is now clear that selection on behavioural traits alone had a prominent role in domestication (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>-<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>). Specifically, it has been demonstrated how selection upon decreased fearfulness and aggression can lead to the myriad of morphological and physiological alterations observed in domesticated animals (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>,<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>). In wild populations, fear is a key behaviour, as a timely and proper response to novelty, e.g. flight response versus exploration, can have direct and large fitness consequences (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>,<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>). Appropriate fear responses are formed and modified throughout ontogeny, during which juvenile animals gradually combine individual experience and social information, thereby developing the ability to discriminate between threatening and neutral stimuli (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>-<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>). Domesticated animals express reduced reactivity towards novel stimuli (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>) and it is thus likely that altered selection pressures caused by domestication have modified the ontogeny of fear related behaviours.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">Ontogeny has been modified in several ways during domestication. Compared to ancestral species, domesticated animals express altered developmental rates, a phenomenon known as heterochrony (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>-<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>), which have resulted in accelerated and/or delayed onsets of various ontogenetic stages, such as earlier sexual maturation and the retention of juvenile traits into adulthood (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>-<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>). Heterochrony has been suggested to affect behavioural ontogeny in domesticated animals by prolonging the sensitive period (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>,<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>-<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>), an important period during behavioural development in which the juvenile animal is particularly sensitive to imprint on and form social bonds with conspecifics (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>,<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>-<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>). During the sensitive period juvenile animals show increased exploratory behaviour, as they readily approach novel stimuli and thereby learn about and socialize with their environment (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref>). Importantly, in the context of the ontogeny of fear, the end of the sensitive period manifests by progressive fear-related avoidance behaviour expressed as increased fear and decreased exploration of novelty (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>,<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>). A shift in the sensitive period caused by domestication has been demonstrated in a long-term selection study, in which juvenile foxes (<italic toggle="yes">Vulpes vulpes</italic>) from domesticated strains expressed a delayed onset of fearful response, at 60-65 days of age, compared to the onset in non-domesticated fox kits, at 40-45 days of age (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>,<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>). While these findings suggest that the basis for the quantifiable difference in fear between domesticated and non-domesticated animals might arise already during early ontogeny, no study has investigated the continued ontogenetic trajectory of fear behaviour after the initial onset of the fearful response.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">The domestic dog (<italic toggle="yes">Canis familiaris</italic>) is an excellent study species when addressing questions about how domestication has affected the ontogeny of behaviour. Domestication of the dog from the grey wolf (<italic toggle="yes">Canis lupus</italic>) occurred at least 15,000 years ago (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>), making the dog the first domesticated species and with the ancestral species extant, the opportunities for comparisons are ideal (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref>). Studies of behavioural ontogeny in dogs have focused on the sensitive period, and the fear of novelty is reported to manifest and continually increase in the dog puppy from eight weeks of age onward (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>,<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>,<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>,<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>). In wolves, consensus on when fear behaviour is established is lacking, with the onset of fearful response reported to occur as varied as four to eight weeks of age across studies (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>,<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref>-<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>). However, the majority of these wolf studies were conducted over a short period of time and/or focused on isolated individuals or single litters, limiting our ability to generalize from these findings. Additionally, a recent study found that juvenile wolves explored novel objects more than dogs at both six and eight weeks of age (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref>), thereby suggesting that that wolves might not express fear towards novelty at an earlier age than dogs. Thus, while adult wolves (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>) and wolf-dog hybrids (<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">34</xref>) are more fearful of novelty than dogs, when this difference is established during ontogeny is not well resolved. Therefore, extended studies of the continued development of fear after the onset of fearful response is needed to further understand domestication driven changes in behavioural ontogeny in canids.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">To investigate if behavioural differences in fear towards novelty differ between wolves and dogs during the first six months of life, we here examine their behavioural development by using repeated novel object tests. The novel object test is an established method to quantify fear and exploration of novelty and has been used on numerous species (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref>,<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>,<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref>-<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref>) We tested three litters of wolves (N = 13) and two litters of dogs (N = 12), hand-raised under similar conditions at six, 10, 14, 18, 22 and 26 weeks of age, i.e. before sexual maturity, and varied the context by using a new novel object in each of the six tests. Our overall goal was to test the hypothesis that the sensitive period is prolonged in dogs, resulting in a delayed onset of fearful response in dogs compared to wolves. Based on studies reporting delayed onset of fear behaviour in domestic compared to ancestral species (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>,<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">38</xref>), including dogs and wolves (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>,<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>), we expected wolves to be more fearful compared to dogs already at six weeks or, alternatively, at ten weeks of age. Furthermore, we wished to investigate how different timing of the onset of fearful response affects the continued behavioural development of fear in wolves and dogs. We predicted that domestication has lowered the sensitivity to novelty in dogs (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>,<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">39</xref>), and dogs therefore would express decreased fear towards the novel object compared to wolves throughout the testing period.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-4">Methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><label>a)</label><title hwp:id="title-5">Study animals</title><p hwp:id="p-7">During 2014 – 2016 two litters of Alaskan huskies (N = 12) and three litters of European grey wolves (N = 13) were hand-raised and extensively socialized under similar conditions from the age of 10 days at Stockholm University’s Zoological Research Station, Tovetorp. This set-up was chosen to minimize environmental bias, including maternal effects, which is well-documented to affect the development of behavioural patterns (<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">40</xref>-<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">42</xref>). Puppies were raised within litters and socialization involved 24-hour presence of human caregivers for the first two months. From two months of age, caregiver presence was decreased with a few hours a day until three months of age and then further decreased during every other night at four months of age. At six months of age, caregivers spent four to six hours with the puppies a day. All wolf and dog litters were kept separate, but reared under standardized conditions. From the age of 10 days to five weeks, puppies were reared in identical indoor rooms and here after given access to smaller roofed outdoor enclosures. After a week of habituation to the roofed outdoor enclosure, puppies were given access to a larger fenced grass enclosure at six weeks of age. Hereafter the puppies had free access to all three enclosures during the day and access to the indoor room and the roofed enclosure during the night. When the puppies where three months old they were moved to large outdoor enclosures (2,000 square meters), in which they remained for the rest of the study period. We started behavioural observations at 10 days of age and behavioural testing was initiated at 6 weeks of age. Testing procedures and exposure to the new environments were standardized over all three years. As required by Swedish law, all hand-raisers were ethically certified and trained to handle animals. Furthermore, rules were implemented to assure that rearing was standardized across all caregivers. This included that puppies were never disciplined, trained or forced to have contact with their caregivers. From the age of eight weeks, puppies were gradually exposed to strangers through the fence with the support of one or more human caregivers.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">The dog litter from 2014 consisted of five males and one female and the 2015 litter of three males and three females.

To account for the repeated measures of individuals and the non-independence of individuals from the same litter, we included random intercepts for both factors. The full model in lme4 syntax: y ∼ species * age + sex + duration + (1|individual) + (1|litter).

Both latencies were log<sub>10</sub> transformed, and the time spent looking, investigating and manipulating the novel object were log transformed after adding 1, in order to fulfil the assumption of normality in the model residuals. We centred the age variable to aid interpretation of the species effect in case of an interaction. When the interaction was retained in the model, we additionally fitted a model where age was a discrete variable, and used that to perform post-hoc tests for species differences at each age (Table S5).

However, while previous studies in wolves and dogs have focused exclusively on the timing of the initial onset of fear (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref>,<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref>,<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>), it has been unclear if and how a developmental shift during early ontogeny, caused by domestication, affects the continued development and expression of fear in either species. Here we present the first extended examination of the development of fear behaviour within the juvenile period in wolves and dogs. Contrary to expectation, we found no evidence in support of a delayed onset of fear response in dogs compared to wolves during early stages of development. Instead we found that dogs strongly reduced their fear response to a novel object in the period between six and 26 weeks of age. Critically, wolves did not differ in their fear response towards novelty over time, and the detected species difference was caused solely by a progressive reduced fear response in dogs. Furthermore, dogs and wolves did on average not differ in their interaction with the novel object. Together our results suggest that species differences in fear of novelty are not caused by a domestication driven shift in the first onset of fear response. Instead, we suggest that a loss of sensitivity towards novelty with increasing age in dogs causes the difference in fear expression towards novelty in wolves and dogs.</p><p hwp:id="p-25">Fearfulness has previously been quantified by the latency to approach and explore novelty, and novel stimuli such as objects, arenas and people have been used to detect the timing of the initial onset of fear response in both wolves and dogs (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-8" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>,<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>,<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref>,<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>,<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>) However, while there is a general expectation that domestication has caused a delay in the sensitive period in dogs, resulting in later onset of fear behaviour in dogs compared to wolves (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>,<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>,<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref>,<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>,<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">47</xref>), we detected no species differences in fear expression during early development. This finding is in agreement with a recent study comparing exploration of novelty in six and eight weeks old wolves and dogs, which found no species differences in the latency to make contact with a novel object (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref>). Yet, it has been reported that adult wolves express increased latency to make contact to a novel object compared to dogs (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>), thereby indicating that species differences in fear expression might arise later in development than previously thought. Thus, our finding that a species difference in latency to approach a novel object occurred at 26 weeks of age represents the first indication of when a quantifiable difference in fear towards novelty arises in wolves and dogs. We do, however, caution against an overly strong confidence in the exact timing of species differences occurring at 26 weeks. It is possible that the difference emerges in the weeks prior, but that the current sample size is insufficient for detection. However, it is clear that a difference between species progressively develops towards the later end of the time period measured here, and that we have captured the transition from equal fear towards novelty to a clear species difference. Importantly, the species difference in fear towards novelty did not occur because wolves became more fearful with age, as expected, but rather because dogs decreased their time to approach the novel object. Specifically, we detected no increased expression of fear towards novelty in neither wolves nor dogs throughout the study period, and notably wolves did not change their latency to approach the novel object throughout with age. This indicates that the development of fear response in wolves and dogs follows different trajectories, with dogs, but not wolves, loosing their sensitivity towards novelty with age.</p><p hwp:id="p-26">The species difference we found in the latency to approach the novel object is not clearly reflected in differences in interaction with the same novel object. While fear of novelty was expressed immediately, through a delayed approach, once the novel object was approached this initial fearfulness appears to no longer affect behavioural responses, and thus wolves and dogs did not differ in their latency to make contact with or interact with the novel object. While the latency to approach the novel object and the time spent being active and passive while in the test room showed consistent linear development over time in both wolves and dogs, the pattern in looking at, investigating and manipulating the novel object appeared variable across trials. This variability was most likely caused by the different novel objects that were used in the study, i.e. behaviours that are more closely related to the object itself show more variability across tests. For example, the stuffed wolverine toy clearly provided more incentive for manipulation than the upside-down wheelbarrow. It is possible that this increased variance may have prohibited detection of additional species differences in behavioural measures directly related to the novel object, such as increased exploration and manipulation of novel objects as reported in both juvenile and adult wolves compared to dogs (Moretti et al., 2015, Marshall-Pescini et al. 2017)</p><p hwp:id="p-27">Wolves develop physically faster than dogs (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">48</xref>), and it has been suggested that wolves express increased activity at an earlier age than dogs due to this difference in developmental pace of motor patterns (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref>,<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">48</xref>). However, while we do find a species difference in how much time is spent on active behaviour during tests, this species difference is consistent across age and not restricted to early ontogeny alone. This indicates that wolves, on a general scale, are more active than dogs. While it cannot be ruled out that active behaviour is affected by the presence of a novel object, it is a less likely explanation for our findings, as we measured behaviours in a non-overlapping way with priority of behaviours related to the novel object. Thus, the measurement of activity does not include looking at, manipulating or approaching the novel object, but only time spent on active behaviour with no attention to the novel object. Instead the higher activity in wolves might reflect an increased reactivity of being separated from littermates and being confined in the test room compared to dogs.</p><p hwp:id="p-28">Domestication has caused a general acceleration of sexual maturity in animals (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>), and earlier sexual maturation in dogs (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>) could explain the steeper behavioural change observed in dogs compared to wolves across some of the behaviours related to the novel object in our study. However, while reproduction in wild living wolf packs is restricted to the breeding couple, it is currently unclear if the lack of sexual activity in non-reproducing pack members is caused by delayed sexual maturity, behavioural suppression or restricted access to nutrition (<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">49</xref>-<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-51-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-51">51</xref>). Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that captive wolves removed from social constraints sexually mature as early as nine months of age (<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-50-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-50">50</xref>). Thus, it is unclear if we should expect behavioural ontogeny to be affected by a shift in developmental pace caused by earlier sexual maturity when comparing wolves and dogs living in captive, non-reproductive groups. Our study was conducted before sexual maturity occurred in either wolves or dogs and as we found no effect of sex on the expression of behaviour, we suggest that the steeper development of some behaviours in dogs are instead related to the loss of sensitivity towards novelty.</p><p hwp:id="p-29">In conclusion, our study shows that wolves and dogs do not differ in their fear towards novelty before late in the juvenile phase. Importantly, the species difference does not occur because wolves become more fearful with age, but because dogs become less fearful with age. These findings have general implications for our interpretation of how domestication has shaped behavioural ontogeny. We suggest that future studies quantify fear related behaviour on a long-term scale to increase our understanding of the behavioural trajectory of fear through different developmental stages.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-20">Acknowledgements</title><p hwp:id="p-30">We wish to thank the Department of Zoology, Stockholm University, for funding this study, our hand-raisers Patricia Berner, Anna Björk, Marjut Pokela, Linn Larsson, Charles Gent, Åsa Lycke, Erika Grasser, Joanna Schinner, Yrsa Andersson, Christoffer Sernert and Mija Jansson, and the staff at Tovetorp Zoological Research Station.</p></ack><ref-list hwp:id="ref-list-1"><title hwp:id="title-21">References</title><ref id="c1" hwp:id="ref-1" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-1-1 xref-ref-1-2"><label>1.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="405480v1.1" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-1"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Driscoll CA"><surname>Driscoll</surname> <given-names>CA</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Macdonald DW"><surname>Macdonald</surname> <given-names>DW</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="O’Brien SJ"><surname>O’Brien</surname> <given-names>SJ</given-names></string-name>.
