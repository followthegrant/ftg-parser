According to one view of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>], the primary cause of fat accumulation involves a shift in the partitioning of metabolic fuels away from pathways of oxidation toward those of fat synthesis and storage. In this case, diet composition can be an important contributing factor; diets rich in carbohydrate, in particular those containing substantial amounts of refined grains and sugars, promote obesity because stimulation of insulin secretion by these nutrients drives metabolic fuels toward the synthesis and storage of fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>]. This is known as the “carbohydrate-insulin” hypothesis. The more conventional model sees obesity as caused by an energy balance disorder in which energy intake exceeds energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>]. According to this “energy balance” hypothesis, this excessive total energy intake, regardless of the macronutrient source of the energy, is the primary cause of obesity.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">The carbohydrate-insulin and energy balance hypotheses make distinctly different predictions about the effects of reducing dietary carbohydrate content on energy expenditure (EE) under conditions in which calories and protein remain constant. The carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis predicts that lowering the proportion of carbohydrate to fat, even while maintaining energy and protein intake, would minimize circulating insulin concentration and thereby promote lipolysis and oxidation of stored and ingested fat, and, as a result, increase EE. On the other hand, the energy balance hypothesis, which assumes “a calorie is a calorie,” predicts that exchanging fat calories for carbohydrate calories would have no appreciable effect on energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-9">In preparation for an anticipated full-scale trial to test these competing predictions, Hall et al. conducted a pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>] in which they measured EE in participants with overweight and obesity who were housed in metabolic wards before and after they were switched from a high-carbohydrate baseline diet to an isocaloric ketogenic diet containing equivalent protein and little carbohydrate. EE was measured two ways: using metabolic chambers for two consecutive days each week throughout the study, and using doubly labeled water during the last 2 weeks of each 4-week diet period. EE measured in metabolic chambers increased significantly after the switch to the ketogenic diet, but this change was transient, lasting only two weeks, and was considered to be relatively small by Hall et al., which led them to conclude that the results did not support the carbohydrate-insulin model. However, in contrast to the results using metabolic chambers, EE, measured using doubly labeled water (EE<sub>DLW</sub>) after the response in the chambers had waned, increased more substantially after the switch to the ketogenic diet (151 kcal/d vs. 57 kcal/day). This response was attributed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>] to greater energy expenditure from increased physical activity when subjects ate the ketogenic diet and were outside the chambers living in the ward.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">The carbohydrate-insulin and energy balance hypotheses have distinctly different implications for understanding the etiology of obesity and devising effective strategies for preventing and treating it. Consequently, it would be useful to reconcile the discrepant findings from measurements of EE using metabolic chambers and doubly labeled water. Hall et al. made the data from their study publicly available on the Open Science Framework (OSF) website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>]. In this paper, we report results of additional analyses of this dataset to differentiate the effect of housing subjects in a metabolic chamber versus in a metabolic ward on the magnitude of the increase in EE<sub>DLW</sub> after the switch to the ketogenic diet and to assess the role of physical activity in this effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-6"><title hwp:id="title-8">Methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-7"><title hwp:id="title-9">Overview of the Hall et al. study</title><p hwp:id="p-11">Details of the design and methods of the study can be found in the Hall et al. paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>], including the online supplementary data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>], and in the published IRB-approved protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>]. Briefly, focusing on methods relevant to the analyses described here, 17 males with overweight or obesity were admitted as inpatients to metabolic wards and fed a baseline diet (BD; 15:50:35 percent of calories from protein:carbohydrate:fat) for 4 weeks followed by an isocaloric ketogenic diet (KD; 15:5:80 percent of calories from protein:carbohydrate:fat) for another 4 weeks. Subjects were housed in a metabolic chamber for two consecutive days each week throughout the study to measure daily EE, sleeping EE, and respiratory quotient (considered primary endpoints of the study). During the last 2 weeks of each diet period, average daily EE was measured using doubly labeled water (EE<sub>DLW</sub>; considered an exploratory endpoint of the study). Physical activity level was monitored throughout the study using accelerometers; each subject wore an accelerometer (GT3XE+; Actigraph Corporation) on a hip, wrist and ankle, and accelerometer counts and the length of time wearing the devices were logged for each device location.

The 14-day period for measuring EE<sub>DLW</sub> included 4 days when subjects were confined to a metabolic chamber and 10 days when subjects lived in the ward. Hall et al. reported EE<sub>DLW</sub> as a daily average across the 14-day measurement period and did not differentiate EE during the non-chamber days, when subjects were housed in the ward, from the chamber days, when EE is relatively lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>] and the effect of diet was much reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-15">To determine average daily EE<sub>DLW</sub> for only those days in which subjects were housed in the ward, we used a term in Hall et al.’s Equation 6 for calculating non-chamber EE (EE<sub>nonchamber</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>]. In essence, the resulting equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-1-1" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-1">Equation 1</xref> below) separates average daily EE for days subjects were housed in the wards from days they were confined to metabolic chambers by subtracting total EE measured during the 4 chamber days (EE<sub>chamber</sub>) within the EE<sub>DLW</sub> measurement period from total 14-day EE<sub>DLW</sub> and averaging the resulting value over the 10 non-chamber days.

This subject showed the largest increase in EE<sub>DLW</sub> after the switch from the BD to the KD (1136 kcal/d), which was identified statistically as an outlier value using Cook’s distance. Because this subject’s relatively extreme change in EE<sub>DLW</sub> was not apparently due to a documented error in, for example, data collection, recording, computation or coding, best practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>] indicate that the EE<sub>DLW</sub> analysis should be reported with and without the outlier data. To that end, we compared EE<sub>DLW</sub> and EE<sub>nonchamber</sub> during the two diet periods, as above, except that data from Subject 04-012 were included in the analysis.</p><p hwp:id="p-19">Hall et al. justified exclusion of Subject 04-012’s data on the basis that he gained 0.2 kg during the KD period despite the marked increase in EE<sub>DLW</sub> after the switch to the KD and an EE<sub>DLW</sub> during the KD period that substantially exceeded his energy intake. To determine whether the extreme change in Subject 04-012’s EE<sub>DLW</sub> was reflected in other parameters related to his energy balance in the KD period, we examined his change in body weight, absolute EE<sub>DLW</sub> and energy intake, and the difference between EE<sub>DLW</sub> and intake relative to the entire group of subjects during the KD EE<sub>DLW</sub> measurement period.</p><p hwp:id="p-20">The reported 0.2 kg weight gain occurred over two body composition assessments performed during the latter part of the KD period. As a check on the weight change based on body weights collected during the body composition assessments, we evaluated the change in body weight during the EE<sub>DLW</sub> measurement period using daily body weight data from the dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s2e" hwp:id="sec-11"><title hwp:id="title-13">Accelerometer data</title><p hwp:id="p-21">Hall et al. evaluated whether greater physical activity accounted for the increase in EE<sub>DLW</sub> during the KD period by calculating energy expenditure from physical activity in and out of the metabolic chambers (i.e, PAE<sub>chamber</sub> and PAE<sub>nonchamber</sub> as per their <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-2-2" hwp:rel-id="T2">Table 2</xref>). Physical activity energy expenditure outside the chambers was higher during the KD period compared to the BD phase, but the effect was not statistically significant. Physical activity level was measured directly throughout the study using accelerometers; however, only hip count data were reported and only as a percentage difference between chamber and non-chamber days during the entire BD period. Here, we used the accelerometer data in the OSF dataset to determine more directly whether differences in physical activity can account for the increase in EE<sub>DLW</sub> after the switch to the KD.</p><p hwp:id="p-22">To confirm reproducibility and help validate our use of the accelerometer data, we first reanalyzed the fractional difference between hip accelerometer counts from chamber and non-chamber days during the baseline period of the study using the published dataset and code. We next analyzed daily hip, wrist and ankle accelerometer counts during the BD and KD EE<sub>DLW</sub> measurement periods with respect to whether subjects were confined to chambers or were housed in the ward (i.e., chamber and non-chamber days) using generalized linear mixed models. Average accelerometer wear times varied little with respect to device location, diet and housing status. In keeping with Hall et al.’s calculation and analysis of physical activity energy expenditure, accelerometer data were analyzed excluding data from Subject 04-012. In a separate analysis, this subject’s data was included.

However, because there is no documented error in, for example, data collection, recording or computation, the cause of this apparently exaggerated response is unknown. Taken together with the relatively small number of subjects in this pilot study, and the lack of previous research to help determine the range of response to KD diets under these controlled conditions, additional research will be required to determine whether this subject’s data are invalid or reflect a relatively extreme response seen in a small proportion of the population.</p><p hwp:id="p-39">According to Hall et al., the carbohydrate-insulin model predicts that consuming a KD would increase energy expenditures by 300-600 kcal/d. The higher value is suspect, having been based on a theoretical estimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>] of a 400-600 kcal/d expenditure to support gluconeogenesis under conditions very different than those in the Hall et al. study, specifically prior to adaptation to a low-carbohydrate diet with only endogenous, not dietary, protein as the substrate. In contrast, Bistrian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>] recently estimated the energy cost of gluconeogenesis associated with consumption of a ketogenic diet at 110 kcal/day (not allowing for tissue glucose demands) under conditions very similar to those employed in Hall et al. (i.e., eucaloric after an adaptation period). The lower value cited by Hall et al.’s (300 kcal/d) was based on the results of a randomized cross-over study by Ebbeling et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>] in which EE<sub>DLW</sub> in free-living weight-reduced subjects was, depending on how expenditures were calculated, ~250-325 kcal/d greater when subjects ate a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet compared with a high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet. More recently, Ebbeling et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>] reported results from a larger and longer duration randomized group trial in which EE<sub>DLW</sub> in free-living weight-reduced subjects eating a low-carbohydrate diet was, depending on whether data were analyzed by an intention-to-treat or per protocol analysis, ~200-280 kcal/d greater than that of subjects consuming a high-carbohydrate diet. Whereas these effects of diet on EE<sub>DLW</sub> in these two studies were observed under very different conditions than those in the Hall et al. study, including during maintenance of a 10-15% weight loss, the magnitude of the effects was similar to the increase of ~200-280 kcal/d in EE<sub>nonchamber</sub> after the diet switch in the Hall et al. study.</p><p hwp:id="p-40">The order in which subjects in the Hall et al. study were fed the BD and the KD was not counterbalanced or otherwise controlled for, a trial design limitation noted by the authors that precluded causal inference about the effect of the KD.

The similarity in the responses to a low carbohydrate diet in the Ebbeling et al. studies and, with respect to EE<sub>nonchamber</sub>, to the KD in the Hall et al. study, lends credence to the conclusion that consumption of the KD caused the increase in EE<sub>DLW</sub> in the Hall et al. study.</p><p hwp:id="p-41">Estimates of the increase in EE<sub>nonchamber</sub> from the current analysis likely represent a minimal range for the effect size.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">20</xref>] recently argued that the increase in EE<sub>DLW</sub> after the switch to the KD in their earlier pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-12" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>] was partially due to methodological issues associated with the doubly labeled water technique. Based on hypothetical relationships between diet composition, energy balance and measured RQ, they suggested that their earlier calculation of EE<sub>DLW</sub> overestimated the effect of switching to the KD. Adjusting for these factors, they found that the increase in EE<sub>DLW</sub> after the diet switch was diminished to statistically nonsignificant levels, an effect that was due primarily to an increase in estimated EE<sub>DLW</sub> in the BD period as opposed to a change in the KD period. Hall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">20</xref>] identified two participants as outliers (Subjects A and B; Subject B is Subject #04-012 referred to above).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">20</xref>] showed large discrepancies between EE<sub>DLW</sub> and energy intake. However, as reported above in relation to analysis of Subject 04-012’s (Subject B’s) designation as an outlier and as described in the Supporting Information (S3 File, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-3-1" hwp:rel-id="T3">Table 1S</xref>), other subjects showed differences between expenditure and intake that, while not as large, were substantial and were also incommensurate with changes in weight. Which of the outlier data is chosen for exclusion in data analysis markedly affects estimates of energy expenditure (Supporting Information File S3, Figure 2S). In the case of Subjects A and B together, it reduced effect size to nonsignificant levels. In other cases, it reduced the effect size less while retaining statistical significance, and, importantly, in some cases the choice of outliers increased the effect size. These finding suggest that the selection of outliers by Hall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">20</xref>] was too restrictive and thereby may have overly circumscribed the interpretation of the results of their reanalysis.</p><p hwp:id="p-44">The changes in weight that were part of the assessment of outliers in the original and recent Hall et al. studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-14" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">20</xref>] were derived from body weight measurements taken over the interval between two body composition assessments in the latter part of each diet period. Hall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-7" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">20</xref>] claimed that assessments were coincident with the EE<sub>DLW</sub> measurement periods.

Hall et al. reported that Subjects A and B gained weight during the EE<sub>DLW</sub> measurement period based on the body composition assessment measures (0.6 and 0.2 kg, respectively). In contrast, both subjects lost 0.5 kg of weight when body weight change was measured over a period that was in fact concurrent with the EE<sub>DLW</sub> measurement period using daily body weight data from the Hall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-15" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>] dataset. Although the magnitude of body weight changes differed in all but one subject depending on whether it was based on body composition assessment data or was synchronized with the EE<sub>DLW</sub> measurement period using daily body weight data, only Subjects A and B showed such a reversal. Differences in measurement precision does not appear to account for the difference in body weight change because weight changes across the interval for the body composition assessments measured using daily body weight data were similar to those based on weights measured during the assessments (File S3, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-4-2" hwp:rel-id="T4">Table 2S</xref>).

Hall et al.

However, as discussed above, the timing of body composition assessments and EE<sub>DLW</sub> measurement periods differed and a difference of just a few days markedly affected estimates of changes in body weight. Such asynchrony might add additional uncertainty to estimates of body composition and, in turn, energy balance. To what extent the results of Hall et al.’s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-9" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">20</xref>] reflect the hypothetical relationships between diet composition, energy balance and RQ upon which their reanalysis is based or the imprecision of their measurements remains to be determined.</p><p hwp:id="p-46">In their reconsideration of the original paper, Hall et al.

These investigators hypothesized that the different outcomes between methodologies to limitations on physical activity imposed by the metabolic chamber. The present analyses of the Hall et al. data similarly suggest that the magnitude of the effect of a KD on EE depends on conditions in which physical activity is not restricted by the confines of a metabolic chamber. Although more direct methodological comparisons are needed, the preferred approach for studies of the effect of nutritional status or dietary composition on energy balance would appear to entail at least the opportunity for physical activity afforded by a metabolic ward along with appropriate methods for measurement of EE that do not require restricted confinement.</p></sec><sec id="s4c" hwp:id="sec-22"><title hwp:id="title-24">Increased non-chamber energy expenditure – possible mechanisms</title><p hwp:id="p-48">Accelerometer counts, a direct measure of physical activity, did not increase and, in the case of hip counts, decreased during the EE<sub>DLW</sub> measurement period after the switch from the BD to the KD.

Accelerometry in these studies and the Hall et al. study may not have captured all components of physical activity contributing to nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">25</xref>], although the hip and wrist accelerometers counts likely reflected walking, which is a major component of NEAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">25</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-49">Sleeping energy expenditure, derived from sleeping metabolic rate, was greater during the EE<sub>DLW</sub> measurement period after the switch to the KD. Because sleeping metabolic rate approximates as much as 80-100% of basal metabolic rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">26</xref>], the difference in sleeping energy expenditure suggests that the KD may have increased basal energy expenditure by ~50 kcal/d, accounting for ~18-25% of the increase in daily energy expenditures depending on the range of estimates for the effect of the KD. Such an estimate must be tempered, however, given that physical activity during sleep will increase metabolic rate and that the difference in sleeping metabolic rate as a function of diet measured in chambers may differ from that when subjects were sleeping in the ward.</p><p hwp:id="p-50">After allowing for an elevation in basal metabolic rate and some contribution from physical activity not monitored by accelerometers, much of the increase in EE<sub>DLW</sub> during the KD period appears left to be explained. Given that the effect of switching to the KD is limited to days subjects were housed in the ward, the increase in EE<sub>nonchamber</sub> may have been dependent on the increase in physical activity outside the chambers but not directly caused by it. Much of the increase in thermogenesis in overfed subjects housed on a metabolic ward is due to an increase in non-resting energy expenditure and about one-third of this effect has been attributed to lower skeletal muscle work efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">27</xref>]. This suggests that nutritional factors can affect energy expenditures and may do so in part by increasing the energetic cost of physical activity. Consumption of a very low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet could have similar effects; indeed, as early as 1920, Krogh and Lindhard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">28</xref>] described the “waste” of energy from fat in exercising humans maintained on a largely fat, as compared with a primarily carbohydrate, diet. On the other hand, in the Hall et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-18" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>], EE measured during the prescribed cycling exercise in the chambers was similar in the two diet periods. This observation argues against a change in muscle work efficiency in the KD period; however, it is not known whether the efficiency of muscle work associated with the increase in other forms physical activity in a ward setting may have been affected. Greater physical activity outside the chambers may also have increased EE during the KD period by creating a demand for glucose, some of which under the condition of severe dietary carbohydrate restriction would be met through the energetically expensive process of hepatic gluconeogenesis [see also 16]. The elevated plasma concentrations of glucagon and the increase in protein catabolism (as evidenced by increased urinary nitrogen, urea and ammonia excretion) during the KD period in the Hall et al. study are consistent with such a higher rate of gluconeogenesis, which has been suggested as a contributing cause of the increased thermogenesis associated with consumption of ketogenic diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-23"><title hwp:id="title-25">Conclusions</title><p hwp:id="p-51">On the basis of the transient and what was considered a relatively small increase in EE measured in the metabolic chambers after the switch to the KD, Hall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-19" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>] concluded that the results of their pilot study did not support the prediction of the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis of obesity that such an isocaloric change in diet would increase EE. This finding has been cited as evidence refuting the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis, offering further support for the energy balance hypothesis of obesity that emphasizes a calorie-is-a-calorie perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">31</xref>]. Such a conclusion may be premature given the robust increase in EE associated with consumption of the KD as measured using doubly-labeled water in Hall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-20" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>]. Indeed, on the basis of the increase in EE<sub>DLW</sub> and, especially, in EE<sub>nonchamber</sub>, the results are entirely consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis, which predicts an increase in EE with restriction of carbohydrate intake and the resulting decrease in insulin secretion. Overnight insulin withdrawal in patients with type 1 diabetes increases basal (resting) energy expenditure, a response that has been attributed to hyperglucagonemia and is associated with increased protein catabolism [see 32 for a review]. Although the chronic reduction in insulin secretion during the KD period in the Hall et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-21" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>] was not as great, it was also associated with increases in basal metabolic rate (as estimated from sleeping energy expenditures), plasma glucagon concentrations, and protein catabolism (as indicated from urinary nitrogen, urea and ammonia excretion). These factors, along with a possible increase in gluconeogenesis, deserve further exploration in future studies of the effect of ketogenic diets on energy expenditure.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-26">Acknowledgments</title><p hwp:id="p-52">We thank Marc Hellerstein, Mitchell Lazar and Michael Tordoff for their thoughtful and helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper, John Thyfault for helpful discussions and suggestions, and William Wong for helpful assistance with the analysis and interpretation of doubly labeled water and respirometry data.</p></ack><ref-list hwp:id="ref-list-1"><title hwp:id="title-27">References</title><ref id="c1" hwp:id="ref-1" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-1-1"><label>1.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="383752v4.1" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-1"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Astwood EB"><surname>Astwood</surname> <given-names>EB</given-names></string-name>. <article-title hwp:id="article-title-2">The heritage of corpulence</article-title>. <source hwp:id="source-1">Endocrinology</source> <year>1962</year>;<volume>71</volume>: <fpage>337</fpage>–<lpage>41</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="c2" hwp:id="ref-2"><label>2.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="383752v4.2" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-2"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Friedman MI"><surname>Friedman</surname> <given-names>MI</given-names></string-name>. <article-title hwp:id="article-title-3">Fuel partitioning and food intake</article-title>. <source hwp:id="source-2">Am J Clin Nutr</source> <year>1998</year>;<volume>67</volume>(suppl): <fpage>513S</fpage>–<lpage>8S</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="c3" hwp:id="ref-3" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-3-1"><label>3.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="383752v4.3" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-3"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Ludwig DS"><surname>Ludwig</surname> <given-names>DS</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Friedman MI"><surname>Friedman</surname> <given-names>MI</given-names></string-name>. <article-title hwp:id="article-title-4">Increasing adiposity: consequence or cause of overeating?</article-title> <source hwp:id="source-3">JAMA</source> <year>2014</year>;<volume>311</volume>: <fpage>2167</fpage>–<lpage>8</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="c4" hwp:id="ref-4" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-4-1"><label>4.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="383752v4.4" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-4"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Taubes G"><surname>Taubes</surname> <given-names>G</given-names></string-name>. <article-title hwp:id="article-title-5">The science of obesity: what do we really know about what makes us fat?

In both studies, subjects were considered outliers, and their energy expenditure data excluded from analysis, based on <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> observations indicating that their energy expenditure measured using doubly labeled water (EE<sub>DLW</sub>) was not commensurate with other parameters of energy balance. In their recent reanalysis of the original study, two outliers so identified were reported to have gained weight during the ketogenic diet (KD) period despite EE<sub>DLW</sub> in excess of energy intake (EI). One of the two participants (“Subject A”) also gained weight during the BD period although EE<sub>DLW</sub> exceeded energy intake and showed a “sleight” gain in fat mass during both periods. The other participant (“Subject B”) was also identified statistically as an outlier with respect to the magnitude of his increase in EE<sub>DLW</sub> after the switch from the BD to KD diet. We examined the database for other participants who showed changes in body weight that were discrepant with respect to the difference between their EE<sub>DLW</sub> and EI because this was a criterion for outlier status that was met by both Subject A and B.</p><p hwp:id="p-71">Subjects A and B (Subject ID #’s 04-006 and 04-012, respectively; Group 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-3-2" hwp:rel-id="T3">Table 1S</xref>) showed the greatest increase in EE<sub>DLW</sub> over EI associated with weight gain of all 17 study participants.</p><table-wrap id="tblS1" orientation="portrait" position="float" hwp:id="T3" hwp:rev-id="xref-table-wrap-3-1 xref-table-wrap-3-2 xref-table-wrap-3-3 xref-table-wrap-3-4 xref-table-wrap-3-5"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;383752v4/TBLS1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">T3</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">tblS1</object-id><label>Table 1S.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-3"><p hwp:id="p-72">Putative outliers based on discrepancies between body weight change and the difference in energy expenditure and energy intake.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="383752v4_tblS1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-7"/></table-wrap><p hwp:id="p-73">However, five other participants had changes in body weights during the KD period that were incommensurate with the difference between their EE<sub>DLW</sub> and EI.

The effect of excluding Group 2 alone or in combination with Group 1 is especially notable because the energy imbalances reflected by the differences between EE<sub>DLW</sub> and EI, while less than that in Group 1, were substantial.

The differences between body weight measurements from body composition assessments and recorded daily body weights do not appear to be due to differences in the precision of measurement under the two conditions because changes in body weight over the two body composition assessments as determined using daily body weight measurements were consistent with those measured during composition evaluations (Table S2).</p></sec></sec></sec><ref-list hwp:id="ref-list-3"><title hwp:id="title-45">References</title><ref id="rc1" hwp:id="ref-34" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-34-1 xref-ref-34-2"><label>1.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="383752v4.34" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-34"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Hall KD"><surname>Hall</surname> <given-names>KD</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Chen KY"><surname>Chen</surname> <given-names>KY</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Guo J"><surname>Guo</surname> <given-names>J</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Lam YY"><surname>Lam</surname> <given-names>YY</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Leibel RL"><surname>Leibel</surname> <given-names>RL</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Mayer LES"><surname>Mayer</surname> <given-names>LES</given-names></string-name>, <etal>et al.</etal> <article-title hwp:id="article-title-35">Energy expenditure and body composition changes after an isocaloric ketogenic diet in overweight and obese men</article-title>. <source hwp:id="source-34">Am J Clin Nutr</source> <year>2016</year>;<volume>104</volume>: <fpage>324</fpage>–<lpage>33</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="rc2" hwp:id="ref-35" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-35-1 xref-ref-35-2"><label>2.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="383752v4.35" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-35"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Hall KD"><surname>Hall</surname> <given-names>KD</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Guo J"><surname>Guo</surname> <given-names>J</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Chen KY"><surname>Chen</surname> <given-names>KY</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Leibel RL"><surname>Leibel</surname> <given-names>RL</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Reitman ML"><surname>Reitman</surname> <given-names>ML</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Rosenbaum M"><surname>Rosenbaum</surname>, <given-names>M</given-names></string-name>, <etal>et al.</etal> <article-title hwp:id="article-title-36">Methodologic considerations for measuring energy expenditure differences between diets varying in carbohydrate using the doubly labeled water method</article-title>. <source hwp:id="source-35">Am J Clin Nutr</source> <year>2019</year>;<volume>109</volume>: <fpage>1328</fpage>–<lpage>34</lpage>.</citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
