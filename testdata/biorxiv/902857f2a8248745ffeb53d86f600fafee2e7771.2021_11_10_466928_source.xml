In the photothromboris model, the photosensitizer Rose Bengal is systemically introduced to the blood stream and activated by green light to induce aggregation of platelets that eventually cause vessel occlusion. Since the activation of Rose Bengal is a one-photon phenomenon and the molecules in the illuminated area (light path) are subject to excitation, targeting of thrombosis is unspecific especially in the depth dimension.

Ischemia at the stroked sites causes neuronal death or irreversible damage forming an infarct due to the lack of energy substrates. Silent strokes typically occur in small arterioles and cause small-sized infarcts resulting in little expressive symptoms. These so-called microstrokes occur in the cerebral parenchyma and remain undetected until multiple occurrences of microstroke over a period integrate to develop to motor and/or cognitive deficits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Several models have been proposed to generate local embolic or thrombotic stroke in experimental animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>. For instance, hundreds of microspheres of diameter 20-50 µm have been perfused into the upstream of cerebral circulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup>, e.g., the internal carotid artery, to induce embolic ischemic stroke in the downstream arterioles. Microsphere infusion imposes a fair amount of surgical burdens and inherently forms infarcts in multiple places. Since the locations of infarcts are somewhat arbitrary and sometimes ectopic, this method is not optimal for observing the impact of single-vessel occlusion by microscopic <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> imaging.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">Induction of thrombosis by optic means, photothrombosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup>, has been widely utilized by the stroke research community owing to the technique’s reproducibility and flexible target region selection. Photothrombosis is performed by introducing the photo-sensitizer Rose Bengal to the blood and exciting it by green light in the targeted area of the brain surface. Rose Bengal excitation produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damages epithelial cells and promotes aggregation of platelet on the vessel wall that eventually occludes the vessel. Photothrombosis has the advantage of target area selection over other methods as the target region can be specified by excitation light illumination. However, due to the nature of one-photon reaction, photothrombosis is not suited for targeting specific vessels inside the brain tissue because the superficial vessels including capillaries are also subjected to photothrombosis with even higher intensity light. Furthermore, excess exposure of high-intensity excitation light on the mouse cerebral cortex can penetrate into deeper structures like the hippocampus and striatum and occlude off-target areas, making the interpretation of subsequent outcome unclear. Moreover, spot illumination of thrombotic target area does not distinguish between arteries and veins.</p><p hwp:id="p-11">Two-photon microscopy has been utilized widely in bio-imaging due to its superior depth-penetration in the tissue and focus-specific fluorescence excitation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>. Taking advantage of this feature, multiphoton photothrombosis has been reported very recently by a group that employed fix-point irradiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref></sup>. Here we introduce an alternative technique for depth-targeted photothrombosis (DTPT) that can readily be used on a standard two-photon microscope equipped with a resonant scanner. Using this method, we demonstrate photothrombosis in a single vessel or a group of vessels at a targeted depth of up to 300 µm. Remarkably, we show that photothrombosis is induced within 40 sec of laser illumination at the cortical depth of 300 µm without unwanted occlusions above and below the target. These features are favorable for prospective microstroke research since inducing occlusion in individual targeted vessels in the brain parenchyma is considered to mimic silent stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-7"><label>2</label><title hwp:id="title-10">Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-11">Subjects and surgery</title><p hwp:id="p-12">Adult C57BL/6 mice (2-6 months old, 20–30 g) of either sex were used.

Emission light was separated by a dichroic mirror (562 nm, Chroma) with band-pass filters 525/50 nm and 607/70 nm (both from Chroma) for the green and red channels, respectively. The microscope was operated using the ThorImage LS software version 4.0.</p><p hwp:id="p-15">DTPT was carried out as follows.

Second, 300 µL of 20 mg/mL FITC-150k dextran (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) was injected intravenously (i.v.) via the retro-orbital route to label blood vessels. After identifying the target blood vessel using 950 nm excitation light, 100 µL of the photo-sensitizer Rose Bengal (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) was injected (i.v., Rose Bengal concentration: 20 mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref></sup>, and injected every 20 min to maintain the RB concentration in the blood (up to three times). The excitation light wavelength was then changed to 720 nm, and the focal depth was readjusted to the target vessel’s lumen using the least laser power possible (2.9 mW). Next, the scanned area was restricted by increasing the digital magnification so to include only the targeted vessel. To start photothrombosis, the laser intensity was set to 31 mW at the exit of the objective lens, and the selected area was scanned at a high frame rate (30–60 Hz, depending on the scanned area) while monitoring acquired images in real time. If equipped, the far-red detection channel should be switched off to protect PMT.

Despite the widespread utility, photothrombosis has not been utilized for induction of microstrokes targeted specifically at a depth of the cerebral cortex until very recently. This is because conventional photothrombosis relies on one-photon excitation of Rose Bengal: ROS is produced wherever the green photon hits Rose Bengal, hence the formation of thrombosis is biased towards superficial vessels. On the other hand, multiphoton excitation occurs only at the focal spot avoiding the production of ROS production outside the focal plane and thereby enables depth-specific targeting. Indeed, Delafontaine-Martel and colleagues have demonstrated that multiphoton occlusion is feasible by two-photon or three-photon excitation. In their study, two-photon photothrombosis was achievable in depths up to 200 µm from the pial surface, and significantly longer irradiation time (up to 300 seconds) was needed with an excitation wavelength of 1000 nm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-29">In the current work, we further confirm that two-photon photothrombosis is feasible in the mouse brain. Notably, we find that less than 80-s irradiation is sufficient to induce microvessel occlusion at a success rate &gt; 80%. This accelerated two-photon photothrombosis was possible with a significantly shorter wavelength of 720 nm. The one-photon absorption spectrum of Rose Bengal has a broad peak at around 560 nm, and green light of range 530–580 nm is typically used for Rose Bengal activation. Recently, Campaign and Knox have measured the two-photon excitation spectrum of Rose Bengal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref></sup>. According to this study, the two-photon-excited fluorescence increases by approximately three-fold as the excitation wavelength shifts from 780 nm to 720 nm. While the fluorescence emission does not necessarily correlate to ROS production, the demonstration of elevated molecule excitability at 720 nm prompts a future study to characterize ROS production around this wavelength. Another methodological point we consider important for the induction of efficient photothrombosis is that we scan the lumen of the target vessel and avoid irradiating vessel walls (endothelial cells) as much as possible. This procedure, combined with simultaneous irradiation and imaging, is designed for ensuring excitation of Rose Bengal without damaging the vessel integrity. For that matter, it is imperative to perform DTPT shortly after Rose Bengal administration so that the plasma retains sufficient Rose Bengal levels.</p><p hwp:id="p-30">Although not attempted in this study, the shortened time of photothrombosis induction makes it likely that this method is applicable to awake mice, which eliminates confounding factors associated with anesthetics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup> and hence mimics human strokes more closely. A previous study has documented formation of single-vessel clot using a kilohertz pulsed laser of pulse energy a few orders of magnitude more intense than a typical laser used for two-photon imaging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup>, however, this method requires intricate extra optics setup to produce the high-energy pulses.

A clever application of one-photon photothrombosis is targeting penetrating vessels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref></sup>, thereby the partially circumventing the issue of depth-axis-wide activation of Rose Bengal. DTPT offers a distinct advantage over the conventional green light-induced photothrombosis by using infrared light that penetrates deeper into the parenchyma.
