The present experiment employed a self-paced category learning task and fMRI to examine the neural mechanisms underlying stopping of information search and how they contribute to choice accuracy. Participants learned to classify triads of face, object, and scene cues into one of two categories using a rule based on one of the stimulus dimensions. After each trial, participants were given the option to explicitly solve the rule or continue learning. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to examine activation of rule-relevant information on trials leading up to a decision to solve the rule. We found that activation of rule-relevant information increased leading up to participants’ stopping decisions. Stopping was associated with widespread activation that included medial prefrontal cortex and visual association areas. Engagement of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was associated with accurate stopping, and activation in this region was functionally coupled with signal in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Results suggest that activating rule information when deciding whether to stop an information search increases choice accuracy, and that the response profile of vmPFC during such decisions may provide an index of effective learning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Keywords</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">Attention</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">Categorization</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">Decision making</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">fMRI</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">Representational similarity analysis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="47"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

Do I know enough about cars to pick out a good one? When gathering evidence for a decision, individuals are continually faced with the question: Have I learned enough yet? Learners must strike a compromise between collecting enough information to make accurate decisions while avoiding collecting redundant information and—consequently—wasting time and resources.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">Currently, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms that govern decisions about when to stop gathering new information. In the domain of value-based decision making, behavioral research has often focused on heuristics or stopping rules, such as take-the-best, that people employ when presented with cues of varying predictive value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">Gigerenzer &amp; Goldstein, 1996</xref>). The use of such strategies, however, can vary across participants, even in decision environments that encourage the use of a particular heuristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">Newell &amp; Shanks, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">Newell et al., 2004</xref>). Thus recent research has begun to focus on participants’ use of confidence thresholds for determining when stopping is appropriate, as opposed to application of specific rules per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57" hwp:id="xref-ref-57-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-57">Svenson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Karelaia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Hausmann &amp; Läge, 2008</xref>). In the present study, we test the neural mechanisms that contribute to stopping decisions during learning, and how activation of information associated with a choice evolves leading up to when a decision threshold is reached.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Neurobiologically, in a recent study that required participants to take or decline sequentially-presented stock options, stopping of information search was found to engage anterior cingulate, insula, and ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Costa &amp; Averbeck, 2015</xref>). Additionally, accumulated value and reward associated with stopping decisions in sequential sampling paradigms have been associated with activation in lateral orbitofrontal cortex, vmPFC, and the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">Gluth, Rieskamp, &amp; Büchel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Costa &amp; Averbeck, 2015</xref>). Although these results have shed light on the neural correlates of stopping in value-based choice, how they translate to stopping in learning contexts, such as when people make decisions about their mastery of new concepts, remains an open question.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">Rule-based category learning provides an ideal context to examine the neural basis of stopping in learning because many real world concepts are associated with rules, and because the neural systems that support rule-based categorization are well-understood (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51" hwp:id="xref-ref-51-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-51">Seger &amp; Miller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">Ashby &amp; Maddox, 2011</xref>). Cognitively, rule-based category learning involves using hypothesis testing and selective attention to establish and focus on stimulus dimensions that are relevant for predicting category membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">Maddox &amp; Ing, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60" hwp:id="xref-ref-60-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-60">Zeithamova &amp; Maddox, 2006</xref>). For example, when learning to distinguish between birds and mammals, people may learn to selectively attend to whether an organism has wings. Selective attention emerges over the course of learning to minimize prediction error, and has the effect of expanding the representation of dimensions that lead to successful categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">Nosofsky, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">Kruschke, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Folstein, Palmeri, &amp; Gauthier, 2013</xref>). Neurobiologically, rule-based category learning is thought to depend on executive cortico-striatal loops connecting the prefrontal cortex with the head of the caudate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51" hwp:id="xref-ref-51-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-51">Seger &amp; Miller, 2010</xref>), with the ventral striatum playing a particularly important role in both initial rule acquisition and reversal learning in the event of a rule switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50" hwp:id="xref-ref-50-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-50">Seger &amp; Cincotta, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). The medial temporal lobes are thought to be involved in the long-term maintenance and retrieval of these category rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46" hwp:id="xref-ref-46-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-46">Poldrack et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">Davis, Love, &amp; Preston, 2012</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-7">Currently, how the neurobiological systems involved in rule-based category learning contribute to decisions to stop learning is not clear because the vast majority of neuroimaging studies have employed fixed numbers of trials and not given participants leeway in decisions about whether to continue learning. However, it is possible to infer what mechanisms may underlie decisions to stop learning by incorporating predictions from recent neuroimaging research on stopping decisions in value-based choice and research on confidence in choice behavior more generally. In value-based decision making, the vmPFC has been shown to track subjective value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58" hwp:id="xref-ref-58-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-58">Tom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">Bartra et al., 2013</xref>), and is sensitive to cost-benefit discrepancies among response options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">Basten et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">Lim, O’Doherty, &amp; Rangel, 2011</xref>). These findings are consistent with results showing that the vmPFC tracks accumulated value in value-based stopping decisions. Recent findings suggest that vmPFC may also code general decision evidence or confidence associated with a choice, perhaps in parallel with value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">Di Martino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Barron, Garvert, &amp; Behrens, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">Lebreton et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, a number of basic category learning tasks have found that the engagement of vmPFC is correlated with greater decision evidence for categorization choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Grinbald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">DeGutis &amp; D’Esposito, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52" hwp:id="xref-ref-52-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-52">Seger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">Davis, Goldwater, &amp; Giron, 2017</xref>). Thus we expect that decision evidence/confidence signals from the vmPFC may contribute to subjective thresholds participants use when deciding whether they have learned enough information.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">In addition to the vmPFC, we also expect the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) to contribute to stopping decisions. Recent research has suggested that a region of the posterior dlPFC may be involved in comparing accumulated perceptual information to decision criteria when making perceptual decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">Heekeren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59" hwp:id="xref-ref-59-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-59">White et al., 2012</xref>). In terms of decisions to stop gathering new information, the dlPFC may monitor information from a number of regions to determine when stopping criteria have been reached, including confidence signals from the vmPFC. Indeed, several studies have observed increased functional connectivity between the dlPFC and vmPFC when participants make decisions that require weighing the subjective values of different choice options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Baumgartner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">Rudorf &amp; Hare, 2014</xref>). A similar coupling between dlPFC and vmPFC may support computing decision criteria for stopping in category learning.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">As a complement to univariate activation, which measures the extent to which brain regions are engaged leading up to decisions to stop, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) may provide an additional window into how participants are processing category information leading up to stopping decisions. Recent studies have found, as a result of learning, similarities between activation patterns elicited for members of a category come to reflect how participants attend to the stimulus dimensions, such that items sharing values along a rule dimension come to elicit more similar activation patterns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">Mack, Preston, &amp; Love, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">Mack, Love, &amp; Preston, 2016</xref>). Such changes in neural similarity spaces may track participants’ decisions to stop learning. Specifically, we expect that as subjects selectively narrow their attention to a particular rule dimension leading up to a decision to stop gathering information, activation patterns associated with this dimension will become increasingly prominent in the underlying neural similarity space.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">To test our predictions for engagement of the vmPFC/dlPFC and how rule-relevant information will be activated leading up to a stopping decision, we trained participants to categorize triads of visual stimuli using simple rules based on one of three binary stimulus dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The stimulus dimensions consisted of three distinct visual categories: faces, objects and scenes. Participants learned, using trial and error, which stimulus dimension was the rule dimension and was predictive of category membership. Each full task trial was comprised of three to four fixation-separated subcomponents: a learning trial, which involved categorizing the visual stimulus; the presentation of correct/incorrect feedback; a decision trial where participants chose whether to solve the category rule or to continue learning; and finally, if a solve response was made, a trial for selecting between the three possible category rules. The use of a Type I category structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53" hwp:id="xref-ref-53-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-53">Shepard, Hovland, &amp; Jenkins, 1961</xref>) allowed participants to solve rules rapidly, allowing us to robustly measure how activation of rule-relevant information evolved over many different individual decisions to stop learning and solve the rule. To further maximize our ability to detect subtle changes in attentional weighting that result from learning, face, object, and scene images were used as stimulus dimensions. These real-world categories exhibit strong properties for representational decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">Haxby et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">O’Toole et al., 2005</xref>), and were localized within each subject using independent scans to create ROIs that were unbiased to any potential learning effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">Davis et al., 2014</xref>). For the purposes of this study, the representational analysis was focused on the activation of patterns associated with the rule dimension that participants eventually chose as the solution during both the “learning” and “decision” portions of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4 xref-fig-1-5"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;169110v2/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><p hwp:id="p-11">Abstract category structure and an example trial for the self-paced rule learning task. Any given rule follows a Type I category structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53" hwp:id="xref-ref-53-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-53">Shepard, Hovland, &amp; Jenkins, 1961</xref>), where only one stimulus dimension is the “rule dimension” and is predictive of the correct category during learning (e.g., if the category rule is Face: Face 1 = Category 1, Face 2 = Category 2). Each point on the cubes corresponds to one of eight possible exemplars (feature combinations) displayed on the screen. During the task, participants are prompted with the decision to solve the rule or continue learning after each response-feedback pairing. If ‘continue’ is chosen, a new feature combination is randomly selected from the same rule structure and the process repeats. If’solve’ is chosen, participants are taken to a screen where they are prompted to select the object class that constituted the rule dimension. Following a solve response, learning begins again with a random rule and new set of stimuli.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="169110_fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-1"/></fig><p hwp:id="p-12">To successfully navigate our task, participants must first learn to selectively attend to the rule dimension to predict category membership. We hypothesized that the increasing selective attention to the rule dimension prior to stopping would result in multi-voxel patterns that become increasingly similar to the object class associated with the chosen rule dimension as participants’ neared a choice to stop. Once attention is allocated to the potential rule dimension, it is necessary for the participant to monitor the evidence consistent with this category rule. We predicted that vmPFC would be involved in representing the confidence or decision evidence for an attended rule dimension, with stopping marked by greater vmPFC activation than decisions to continue learning. Finally, participants must make a decision to stop learning once this evidence has reached a criterion. We hypothesized that dlPFC would track confidence/decision evidence signals from the vmPFC to determine whether a stopping threshold had been reached.</p><p hwp:id="p-13">To preview our findings, the representational analysis revealed a dynamic neural accumulation process whereby activation of multi-voxel patterns associated with the object class eventually chosen as the rule dimension increased over the trials leading up to stopping decisions. Compared with the choice to continue learning, participants engaged a widespread network of brain regions including medial PFC when choosing to stop; within this contrast, activation of vmPFC and object-selective cortex were positively correlated with participants’ ability to solve rules accurately throughout the task.

Participants first learned to classify image triads as belonging to one of two categories based on feedback delivered following each learning trial. The three simultaneously presented features always consisted of one face, one object, and one scene. One object class was predictive of category membership and was the rule dimension. Subjects were instructed to learn the rule dimension that was predictive of category membership. Each dimension (object class) had two values, resulting in a category structure comprised of six total cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-3" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The face, object, and scene images used were black-and-white squares presented on a white background with black text. The screen positions of each cue (left, right, or center) were randomized on each learning trial to avoid gaze effects. Within each scanning run, the stimuli used for each rule were drawn randomly from a set of 36 images for each respective class, and were removed from the set after they were used for a given rule. After each learning/feedback trial pairing, participants were given the option to explicitly solve the rule (indicating whether faces, objects, or scenes were predictive) or to continue learning. These decision trials were of primary interest to the present study, allowing us to isolate the neural and behavioral correlates of stopping.</p><p hwp:id="p-16">Participants received instructions indicating that their goal was to correctly solve as many rules as possible over the course of the experiment. Beyond the overall instructions to focus on solving rules correctly, correct solves were not explicitly incentivized. Participants were provided with an on-screen summary of their performance (the number of rules solved correctly) at the end of each scanning run. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-4" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref> displays a schematic of the self-paced category learning task. Procedurally, image triads were presented on the screen accompanied by the prompt “Category 1 or Category2?” and a response prompt, with a maximum response time of 3 s. Next, feedback was presented for 1.75 s, indicating whether the response was correct or incorrect accompanied by the correct response. Feedback included presentation of the associated stimulus triad to facilitate learning. Following feedback, participants were prompted to make a button press indicating whether they wished to continue learning or solve the rule. These decision trials had a 2 s response deadline, and did not present the associated image triad. If a continue response was given, the task proceeded to the next category learning trial for the current rule and stimulus set. If a solve response was given, participants were prompted to make a response as to whether the rule (predictive feature) was faces, objects, or scenes within 3 s. Regardless of whether a response was given in the allotted time, the rule and associated set of images were then randomly reset, and the task proceeded to a category learning trial for the new rule.</p><p hwp:id="p-17">Variable fixation periods drawn from truncated exponentials (mean = 2 s) separated stimulus presentation from feedback, feedback from decision trials, decision from solve or the next category learning trial, and solve trials from the next category learning trial. The number of learning trials completed by each participant varied slightly due to the nature of the task and the necessity of a timed cutoff for each scanning run. The mean number of learning trials completed in the sample over 5 functional scans was 150.4 (Range = 140 – 159, <italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 4.28). To provide subjects with a performance index of their rule solving accuracy, at the conclusion of each scanning run a screen notified them of the number of rules they correctly solved during that scan. Participants received instructions and completed practice trials for the task outside of the scanner for approximately 10 minutes before engaging in the fMRI experiment.</p><p hwp:id="p-18">Prior to beginning the rule learning task, participants completed two functional localizer scans. Each trial of the localizer task involved presenting a face, object, or scene individually on the screen, asking subjects to make a button press corresponding to the appropriate item category within 3 s. Variable fixation lengths drawn from a truncated exponential (mean = 2 s) separated each trial. Over the duration of the localizer phase, subjects categorized 38 examples of each object class. The black-and-white images used during the localizer runs were presented in a random order, and did not include any of the stimuli used for the experimental task.</p></sec><sec id="s2c" hwp:id="sec-5"><label>2.3.</label><title hwp:id="title-7">Image Acquisition</title><p hwp:id="p-19">Imaging data were acquired on a 3.0 T Siemens Skyra MRI scanner at the Texas Tech Neuroimaging Institute.

Images were skull stripped, motion corrected, prewhitened, and high-pass filtered (cutoff: 60 s). For univariate analysis, data were spatially smoothed using a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. No spatial smoothing was used for representational similarity analysis. First-level statistical maps were registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-152 template using boundary-based registration (BBR) to align the functional image to the structural image, and 12 df to align the structural image to the MNI-152 template.</p><p hwp:id="p-21">Three-level statistical analysis of the functional data was carried out using FEAT and FSL’s Randomise. At level-one, within-run associations between task regressors and functional time series were examined. Eight task regressors and their temporal derivatives were included in the level-one analysis, including the onsets of correct/incorrect learning trials, correct/incorrect feedback, decision trials receiving a continue response, decision trials receiving a solve response, and correct/incorrect rule-solving trials. Nuisance regressors included temporal derivatives for the task variables, trials in which subjects failed to make a response, realignment parameters from motion correction, their temporal derivatives, and volume-wise indicator variables for scrubbing volumes that exceeded a framewise displacement of 0.9 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54" hwp:id="xref-ref-54-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-54">Siegel et al., 2014</xref>). Task-based regressors were convolved with a double gamma hemodynamic response function, while motion parameters were left unconvolved. Prewhitening was performed at level-one to control for temporal autocorrelation in the hemodynamic response. At level-two, within-run parameter estimates for task variables were averaged across runs for each subject using a fixed effects model. At level-three, we averaged parameter estimates across subjects using a random effects model for population inference. <italic toggle="yes">Z-</italic>scored mean rule solving accuracy was included in the level-three model as a moderator to test the hypothesis of performance-based differences in neural engagement. Final statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons at p &lt; .05 using a permutation-based cluster mass thresholding, implemented in FSL’s Randomise. This analysis included a primary (cluster-forming) threshold of <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = 2.49 (critical value of <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> for df = 24 and alpha = 0.01), and 6 mm variance smoothing.

The estimated neural activation patterns for each onset were then registered to standard space. The aim of the multi-voxel pattern analysis was to examine neural signatures indicating the processing of predictive versus non-predictive item classes over time leading up to a solve decision. To obtain featural selective attention predictions, we computed similarities between the patterns for each trial in the task and the patterns computed for face-, object-, and scene-only trials from the independent localizer. The β-series used to compute the multi-voxel patterns was spatially localized to a functional ROI spanning category-selective brain regions in ventral temporal/occipital cortex that included lateral occipital complex, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal cortex (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA1" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure A1</xref>). This mask was created by binarizing and combining the statistical maps for Object &gt; Scene and Scene &gt; Object from the independent localizer task. As opposed to creating three distinct ROIs for face-, object-, and scene-selective regions, the decision to use a larger cross-category ROI was motivated by the fact that measuring the relative neural similarity to each visual stimulus type at the trial level was crucial for the present analysis. In this scenario, using a combined mask allows pattern estimates for a given feature to vary according to neural activity in the regions specifically associated with that feature, while simultaneously accounting for pattern variability in the alternative regions. Given that attention to a certain object class should lead to high relative activation in the brain region that represents it and relatively low activation in regions that do not, the absence of activation in these alternative regions may add positive predictive value to similarity estimates. A Pearson correlation was used to compute correlation distances (1 – <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>) between trials in the category learning task with face, object, and scene patterns from the independent localizer task within each subject.

Therefore, we first sorted learning trials according to the rules participants selected during the solve stage regardless of whether these solve responses were correct. We then counted back five trials from the solution trial to determine how the activation of information associated with the selected class changed as participants approached a solution. Five trials were analyzed in order to capture the average number of learning trials encountered by participants prior to solving (see Behavioral Results). For each learning trial, similarity estimates for the chosen object class were contrasted with the mean similarity to both of the unchosen object classes. To test whether there were significant time-based changes in neural similarity to the chosen item class during learning, we computed two multi-level models with similarity to chosen/unchosen as the outcome variables and 5-trial n-back to solve as a fixed predictor variable, allowing the intercept for each subject to vary randomly. Similarity output for the chosen/unchosen object classes over 3070 total observations served as the level-1 units for each model, nested within 25 participants. A random slope parameter for n-back was then added to each null model to examine whether the relationship between neural similarities and time differed between subjects. We determined whether to proceed with the inclusion of each random effect parameter (i.e., random time slopes and intercepts for each subject) by comparing AIC between model fits. To determine how the time-course of attention differed across instances of effective and ineffective learning, the same series of analyses were then conducted for similarity to the chosen object class for the learning trials preceding correct and incorrect solves, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2f" hwp:id="sec-8"><label>2.6.</label><title hwp:id="title-10">vmPFC Signal Analysis</title><p hwp:id="p-25">To assess how vmPFC signal may covary with the temporal distance from a solve decision, subject-level accuracy, and neural similarity to the chosen object class, we conducted two multi-level regression models with trial-by-trial vmPFC signal during the decision phase as the outcome variable.

Indeed, a multi-level logistic regression revealed a significant positive relationship between similarity to chosen class on learning trials and the choice to solve the rule (γ = −.319, <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> = −2.99, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .003), allowing each subject to have a random intercept. Including a random slope parameter for similarity to chosen class did not improve model fit based on AIC comparison, and the addition of the random parameter did not affect the statistical significance of this test. Additionally, we found a significant relationship between similarities to unchosen object classes and stopping decisions, with greater neural similarity to these stimulus dimensions predictive of decisions to continue learning (γ = .585, <italic toggle="yes">z</italic> = 2.84, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .004).

Moreover, differences in the time course of similarities to the chosen and unchosen object classes preceding correct, versus incorrect solves suggest that attentional changes over the course of learning may be strongly linked to participants’ learning strategies: correct solves were preceded by steady, linear increases in relative attention to the chosen feature, whereas incorrect solves were marked by greater relative attention to the chosen feature only on trials immediately preceding the solution.</p></sec><sec id="s3c" hwp:id="sec-13" hwp:rev-id="xref-sec-13-1"><label>3.3.</label><title hwp:id="title-15">Association Between Neural Similarity and Accuracy on Decision Trials</title><p hwp:id="p-37">While the analysis of neural similarity to chosen and unchosen object classes during learning revealed trial-level differences in the attention to predictive cues for correct versus incorrect stopping decisions, another question of interest is whether overall task accuracy is related to the extent that participants activate the representations of predictive stimulus dimensions when considering whether to stop or continue learning. In contrast to alternative measures of visual attention such as eye tracking, a significant advantage of our MVPA measure is that the activation of each cue pattern may be compared to the relative activation of alternative cues on a single trial, regardless of whether the relevant stimuli are displayed on the screen at a given time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61" hwp:id="xref-ref-61-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-61">Zeithamova, Dominick, &amp; Preston, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">Lewis-Peacock et al., 2012</xref>).

A series of task-relevant questions pertaining to this prediction are how signal changes in vmPFC might covary with attention to relevant feature dimensions, the temporal distance from a solve decision, and individual differences in rule solving accuracy. In light of the strong relationship between neural similarity to chosen/unchosen object classes during learning and decisions to solve the rule, we first aimed to test whether similarity patterns during learning were predictive of vmPFC signal on the immediately following decision trial, and whether this relationship may be moderated by the temporal distance from a solve decision and subject-level accuracy. We thus computed a multi-level model over decision trials with trial-level vmPFC signal as the outcome variable, and learning similarities to the chosen/unchosen object classes, 5-trial n-back, and subject-level accuracy as predictor variables. The model tested three-way interactions between similarity to the chosen/unchosen object classes, n-back, and accuracy. Interaction effects related to vmPFC signal at the time of decision were not statistically significant, while main effects for similarity to the chosen (γ = −.981, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = −1.92, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .056) and unchosen (γ = −1.92, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = −1.92, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .055) object classes during learning were found to be marginally significant. Given the direction of the relationships between similarity to chosen/unchosen object classes during learning and vmPFC signal on decision trials, our results suggest that vmPFC may be responsive to how strongly individual cues are attended during learning, irrespective of whether the cue is eventually chosen as the relevant rule dimension.</p><p hwp:id="p-40">In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3c" hwp:id="xref-sec-13-1" hwp:rel-id="sec-13">Section 3.3</xref>, we show that participants’ overall accuracy is strongly associated with reactivation of correct cue patterns on decision trials. A related question of interest is how reactivation of chosen/unchosen object classes during the decision phase may relate to trial-level activation of vmPFC. Accordingly, we conducted a multi-level regression with vmPFC signal as the outcome variable, using similarities to the chosen/unchosen object classes on decision trials, 5-trial n-back, and subject-level accuracy as predictor variables. Three-way interactions among similarity to the chosen/unchosen object classes, n-back, and accuracy were tested. Results of the multi-level model revealed a significant two-way interaction between n-back and accuracy in predicting vmPFC signal (γ = −.154, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = −2.45, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .014).

The interpretation of the interaction effect between n-back and accuracy is that a stronger relationship exists between temporal distance from a solve decision and vmPFC signal among higher, versus lower accuracy participants: more accurate participants exhibited a steeper slope of vmPFC activation over time relative to less accurate participants.

Specifically, we examined mean rule solving accuracy as a subject-level moderator for the contrast Solve &gt; Continue. It was predicted that individuals who were more accurate in rule solving would exhibit more sensitivity in the vmPFC and regions that discriminate between faces, objects, and scenes. Two clusters were positively correlated with accuracy on stopping trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-2" hwp:rel-id="F8">Figure 7B</xref>; Table 1). The first cluster was located in right ventral visual cortex, with maxima in lateral occipital complex and occipital fusiform gyrus.

The engagement of our <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> ROIs in the moderation suggests that they are involved in <italic toggle="yes">successful</italic> stopping, as their activity during stop decisions is correlated with the likelihood of subjects knowing the correct rule. Consistent with the prediction that successful stopping decisions would require learned selective attention to predictive object classes, the activation of category selective regions suggests that rule solving accuracy is supported by greater relative consideration of the features associated with a rule when deciding whether to stop. In addition to our attentional predictions, we hypothesized that vmPFC would be associated with task accuracy, as high-performing participants are likely to accumulate more evidence for their decisions and, consequently, be more confident at the time of inference.

This regulation process is instantiated by people’s decisions to stop learning. To understand the neural mechanisms responsible for stopping of information search in humans, we used fMRI and a self-paced category learning task where participants learned unidimensional rules where a single visual feature was predictive of category membership. Our fMRI results show that compared with continuing to learn, decisions to stop engage a broad network of brain regions including PFC, basal ganglia, and visual association cortices. Behaviorally, the sample varied in desired learning length (time-to-stop) and rule-solving accuracy. Higher task accuracy was predictive of greater activation in vmPFC, frontal pole, and right occipitotemporal cortex on stopping trials. Using MVPA, we tracked neural similarity to the features (face, object, or scene) during learning that were eventually chosen to be the predictive class. This analysis revealed a significant linear increase of similarity to chosen classes over the five learning trials prior to a solve response, and further, that pattern similarities were predictive of choice on a trial-by-trial basis. Finally, a psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that the dlPFC was more functionally coupled with the vmPFC when subjects chose to stop versus continue, consistent with its hypothesized role in monitoring accumulated evidence to determine whether a decision threshold has been reached.</p><p hwp:id="p-49">In the context of our rule-based, multi-feature category learning task, individuals must learn to distinguish relevant from irrelevant information to accurately classify exemplars. Rather than measuring fluctuations in mean activation within our ventral visual ROI in response to varying task conditions, the use of MVPA allowed us to estimate the extent to which participants were focusing on each object class over the course of the task. Our analysis revealed that selective attention to object classes that subjects eventually chose as the rule dimension when solving a rule displayed an approximately linear ramping effect over the trials preceding correct solve decisions. Further, trial-by-trial estimates of representational similarity to chosen classes during learning were predictive of decisions to stop learning and solve the rule immediately following the trial. These findings extend previous research suggesting that neural representations of stimuli are modified over the course of category learning to facilitate optimal performance within a variety of task structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">Mack, Love, &amp; Preston, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Folstein, Palmeri, &amp; Gauthier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">Davis &amp; Poldrack, 2014</xref>) by showing how learning-dependent changes in the neural similarity space relate to subjective decision criteria. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the time course of dimensional selective attention in self-paced learning.</p><p hwp:id="p-50">The vmPFC is a region that we hypothesized would be more activated for stopping versus the choice to continue learning. Past research has thoroughly established a role of the vmPFC in reward prediction and subjective value assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58" hwp:id="xref-ref-58-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-58">Tom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">Bartra et al., 2013</xref>). Due to the absence of extrinsic rewards for correct responses or differing outcomes that were mapped on to each feature, in this study it was expected that the vmPFC would serve a more general function of tracking evidence for category rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">Davis, Goldwater, &amp; Giron, 2017</xref>). Indeed, we found vmPFC to be one of the regions involved in stopping, and that activation in vmPFC covaried with task accuracy at the time subjects chose to stop. These results lend support to an emerging area of research that has implicated vmPFC in representing subjective confidence in parallel with value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">De Martino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Barron, Garvert, &amp; Behrens, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">Lebreton et al., 2015</xref>). It is important to note that the present study is unable to dissociate the neural signals associated with confidence from those associated with implicit value, given that the goal of correctly solving as many rules as possible necessarily correlates participants’ confidence with reward maximization. Accordingly, future studies may seek to address whether the vmPFC is particularly sensitive to confidence, value, or a combination of these factors in self-paced learning, perhaps by manipulating the reward associated with different rule dimensions. However, the present results suggest that in learning paradigms that demand varying attention to different visual features, accumulation processes in vmPFC are closely linked to absolute differences in the strength of competing feature representations. The possibility that vmPFC tracks the strength of signal in relevant perceptual regions when weighing a decision accords with our finding that greater task accuracy was associated with higher relative activation in both vmPFC and ventral occipitotemporal cortex. From a learned selective attention standpoint, individuals who represent predictive features the most strongly should both be more confident in their decisions and more accurate in their inferences.</p><p hwp:id="p-51">Our results extend recent research examining the neural correlates of decision evidence in categorization. Using a temporally extended classification task wherein probabilistic cues were presented to participants incrementally within a trial, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">Braunlich and Seger (2016)</xref> employed a model-based fMRI approach to isolate brain regions associated with parametric modulations in decision evidence that were independent of response‐ and urgency-related signals over time. Their results revealed that the absolute value of decision evidence accumulated over a trial correlated with activation in rostral and dorsolateral PFC, but surprisingly, was not associated with increased signal in vmPFC. One possibility for the divergence in results between this study and the current experiment regarding vmPFC is that this region is specifically engaged in relation to subjective appraisals of decision evidence, as opposed to reflecting the objective amount of evidence a person is exposed to. The regions engaged for stopping decisions in our study are not inherently tied to the objective evidence for a rule, as reflected in the high degree of variability in the average number of trials participants chose to view before opting to solve the rules. Rather, by their very nature, these stopping decisions are a reflection of participants’ subjective estimates of making a correct response. This idea accords with findings in the memory literature that implicate vmPFC in tracking metacognitive “feeling-of-knowing” judgments associated with retrieval attempts, but not retrieval accuracy itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">Schnyer, Nichols, &amp; Verfaellie, 2005</xref>). Taken together, we suggest that while rostral and dorsal subregions of the PFC appear to be critical for performing computations related to finite differences in decision evidence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">Heekeren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">Braunlich &amp; Seger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-7" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">Davis, Goldwater &amp; Giron, 2017</xref>), vmPFC may uniquely represent more subjective decision variables such as confidence and the perceived costs and benefits associated with a decision (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">Basten et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-52">Through a psychophysiological interaction analysis, we found that activation in vmPFC during stopping decisions is coupled with modulation of dlPFC. These findings are generally consistent with previous research showing that dlPFC interacts dynamically with vmPFC by comparing value signals represented in the latter region, and that dlPFC may precipitate responses based on this comparison process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">Pochon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Baumgartner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">Kahnt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">Rudorf &amp; Hare, 2014</xref>). When subjects chose to stop learning and respond to the rule, activity in vmPFC covaried with dlPFC to a greater extent than when they were not yet ready to solve. Accordingly, dlPFC may compute whether a decision threshold has been reached based on the relative evidence that has accumulated for a given category rule and participants’ meta-knowledge of the task structure. Our results regarding vmPFC-dlPFC interactions in self-paced category learning serve as a bridge between research focused on simple perceptual decisions and studies that primarily focus on the expected reward or monetary gains/losses incurred from a decision, and suggest that a common neural mechanism may support stopping in both category learning and value-based decision making. Because of the relatively indirect connection between dlPFC activity and stopping behavior in the present study, future research employing model-based fMRI may be useful for testing explicit predictions about the putative executive role of dlPFC in self-paced learning.</p><p hwp:id="p-53">As an alternative to stopping per se, decisions to solve the category rule are involve a switching process, whereby participants explicitly transition from hypothesis testing to solving the perceived category rule. Accordingly, contextualizing our findings in light of the extensive hypothesis testing/rule switching literature may be useful for understanding the various strategies participants may have employed to navigate our stopping task. Neurally, a subset of the regions engaged for Solve &gt; Continue are consistent with those often implicated in rule switching, including the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50" hwp:id="xref-ref-50-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-50">Seger &amp; Cincotta, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55" hwp:id="xref-ref-55-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-55">Simard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">Liu et al., 2015</xref>) and regions that comprise the salience network (dorsal anterior cingulate, anterior insula, and inferior frontal cortex; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Dosenbach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56" hwp:id="xref-ref-56-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-56">Sridharan, Leviton, &amp; Menon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Behaviorally, while an optimal observer may adopt a win-stay lose-shift strategy in matching tasks where correct feedback is fully correlated with knowledge of the correct rule, learners often rely on this strategy in multidimensional classification tasks despite the fact that a string of correct responses may fail to eliminate viable alternative rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53" hwp:id="xref-ref-53-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-53">Shepard, Hovland, &amp; Jenkins, 1961</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">Nosofsky, Palmeri, &amp; McKinley, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">Niv et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44" hwp:id="xref-ref-44-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-44">Paniukov &amp; Davis, 2017</xref>). We found subject-level rule solving accuracy to be strongly associated with the number of learning trials participants encountered before choosing to solve the rule, with less accurate participants choosing to solve after fewer learning trials and fewer instances of correct feedback than those with high accuracy. As such, it is possible that poorer task performers in the current study frequently adopted a suboptimal win-stay lose-shift strategy when deciding whether they were prepared to solve the rule, in some cases using a single correct trial as justification to move away from hypothesis testing and respond with the rule. Our attentional tuning results mirror this possibility, as incorrect solves were preceded by a marked increase in neural similarity to the chosen object class on the final learning trial, as opposed to correct solves where similarity to the chosen class increased in a more gradual manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-3" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 4</xref>).</p><sec id="s4a" hwp:id="sec-19"><label>4.1.</label><title hwp:id="title-21">Conclusions</title><p hwp:id="p-54">To balance accuracy and efficiency in decision making, learners must determine when their current knowledge state matches the knowledge that is required to achieve a particular goal. Using representational similarity analysis, we illustrate that such stopping decisions are preceded by greater activation of patterns consistent with perceived rule dimensions, consistent with theories of learned selective attention. Although stopping engaged a widely distributed network in the brain, our findings suggest that vmPFC and object-selective cortical regions are differentially engaged according to participants’ tendencies to accurately solve rules, and thus these regions may play unique roles in supporting accurate and timely stopping decisions in self-paced category learning. Finally, our results demonstrate that dlPFC is functionally coupled with vmPFC during stopping decisions, suggesting that this region may serve a similar criterion-setting function in self-paced learning to that observed across studies of perceptual and value-based decision making.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-20"><title hwp:id="title-22">AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p hwp:id="p-55">SO, EW, MS, and TD designed the study and wrote the paper.
