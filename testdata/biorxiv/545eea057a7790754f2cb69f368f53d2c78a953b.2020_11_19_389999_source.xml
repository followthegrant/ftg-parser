We investigated environmental and physiological influences on pitch perception, whose properties are commonly linked to peripheral neural coding limits. We first trained artificial neural networks to estimate fundamental frequency from biologically faithful cochlear representations of natural sounds. The best-performing networks replicated many characteristics of human pitch judgments. To probe the origins of these characteristics, we then optimized networks given altered cochleae or sound statistics. Human-like behavior emerged only when cochleae had high temporal fidelity and when models were optimized for naturalistic sounds.

In some cases, it is natural to relate behavior to physiology, and in particular to the constraints imposed by sensory transduction. For instance, color discrimination is limited by the number of cone types in the retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref></sup>. Olfactory discrimination is similarly constrained by the receptor classes in the nose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup>. In other cases, behavior can be related to properties of environmental stimulation that are largely divorced from the constraints of peripheral transduction. For example, face recognition in humans is much better for upright faces, presumably because we predominantly encounter upright faces in our environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Understanding how physiological and environmental factors shape behavior is important both for fundamental scientific understanding and for practical applications such as sensory prostheses, the engineering of which might benefit from knowing how sensory encoding constrains behavior. Yet the constraints on behavior are often difficult to pin down. For instance, the auditory periphery encodes sound with exquisite temporal fidelity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>, but the role of this information in hearing remains controversial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>. Part of the challenge is that the requisite experiments â altering sensory receptors or environmental conditions during evolution or development, for instance â are practically difficult (and ethically unacceptable in humans).</p><p hwp:id="p-9">The constraints on behavior can sometimes instead be revealed by computational models. Ideal observer models, which optimally perform perceptual tasks given particular sensory inputs and sensory receptor responses, have been the method of choice for investigating such constraints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref></sup>. While biological perceptual systems likely never reach optimal performance, in some cases humans share behavioral characteristics of ideal observers, suggesting that those behaviors are consequences of having been optimized under particular biological or environmental constraints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup>. Ideal observers provide a powerful framework for normative analysis, but for many real-world tasks, deriving provably optimal solutions is analytically intractable. The relevant sensory transduction properties are often prohibitively complicated, and the taskrelevant parameters of natural stimuli and environments are difficult to specify mathematically. An attractive alternative might be to collect many real-world stimuli and optimize a model to perform the task on these stimuli. Even if not fully optimal, such models might reveal consequences of optimization under constraints that could provide insights into behavior.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">In this paper, we explore whether contemporary âdeepâ artificial neural networks (DNNs) can be used in this way to gain normative insights about complex perceptual tasks. DNNs provide general-purpose architectures that can be optimized to perform challenging real-world tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup>. While DNNs are unlikely to fully achieve optimal performance, they might reveal the effects of optimizing a system under particular constraints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref></sup>. Previous work has documented similarities between human and network behavior for neural networks trained on vision or hearing tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref></sup>. However, we know little about the extent to which human-DNN similarities depend on either biological constraints that are built into the model architecture or the sensory signals for which the models are optimized. By manipulating the properties of simulated sensory transduction processes and the stimuli on which the DNN is trained, we hoped to get insight into the origins of behaviors of interest.</p><p hwp:id="p-11">Here, we test this approach in the domain of pitch â traditionally conceived as the perceptual correlate of a soundâs fundamental frequency (F0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref></sup>. Pitch is believed to enable a wide range of auditory-driven behaviors, such as voice and melody recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref></sup>, and has been the subject of a long history of work in psychology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref></sup> and neuroscience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref></sup>. Yet despite a wealth of data, the underlying computations and constraints that determine pitch perception remain debated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref></sup>. In particular, controversy persists over the role of spike timing in the auditory nerve, for which a physiological extraction mechanism has remained elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref></sup>. The role of cochlear frequency selectivity, which has also been proposed to constrain pitch discrimination, remains similarly debated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref></sup>. By contrast, little attention has been given to the possibility that pitch perception might instead or additionally be shaped by the constraints of estimating the F0 of natural sounds in natural environments.</p><p hwp:id="p-12">One factor limiting resolution of these debates is that previous models of pitch have generally not attained quantitatively accurate matches to human behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">38</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">40</xref></sup>. Moreover, because most previous models have been mechanistic rather than normative, they do not speak to the potential adaptation of pitch perception to particular types of sounds or peripheral neural codes. Here we used DNNs in the role traditionally occupied by ideal observers, optimizing them to extract pitch information from peripheral neural representations of natural sounds. DNNs have become the method of choice for pitch tracking in engineering applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">41</xref></sup>, but have not been combined with realistic models of the peripheral auditory system, and have not been compared to human perception. We then tested the influence of peripheral auditory physiology and natural sound statistics on human pitch perception by manipulating them during model optimization. The results provide new evidence for the importance of peripheral phase locking in human pitch perception. However, they also indicate that the properties of pitch perception reflect adaptation to natural sound statistics, in that systems optimized for alternative stimulus statistics deviate substantially from human-like behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-4">RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-5">Training task and stimuli</title><p hwp:id="p-13">We used supervised deep learning to build a model of pitch perception optimized for natural speech and music.

To emulate natural listening conditions, the speech and music clips were embedded in aperiodic background noise taken from YouTube soundtracks. The networksâ task was to classify each stimulus into one of 700 F0 classes (log-spaced between 80 Hz and 1000 Hz, bin width = 1/16 semitones = 0.36%F0). We generated a dataset of 2.1 million stimuli.

Each row plots the firing rate of a frequency-tuned auditory nerve fiber, arranged in order of their place along the cochlea (with low frequencies at the bottom). Individual fibers phase-lock to low-numbered harmonics in the stimulus (lower portion of the nerve representation), or to the combination of high-numbered harmonics (upper portion).

We took advantage of the ability to perform experiments on the model that are not possible in biology, training networks with peripheral representations that were altered in various ways. To streamline presentation, we present results for a single psychophysical result that was particularly diagnostic: the effect of lowest harmonic number on F0 discrimination thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-23" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, solid line).

However, thresholds also showed a different dependence on harmonic number as the phase locking cutoff was lowered. Specifically, the transition from good to poor thresholds, here defined as the left-most point where thresholds exceeded 1%, was lower with degraded phase locking. This difference was significant for two of the three conditions (1000 Hz, t(18)=5.15, p&lt;0.001, d=2.30; 50 Hz, t(18)=10.10, p&lt;0.001, d=4.52; two-sample t-tests comparing to the 3000 Hz condition; the transition point was on average lower for the 320 Hz condition, but the results were more variable across architectures, and so the difference was not statistically significant). Increasing the cutoff to 6000 Hz or 9000 Hz had minimal effects on both of these features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-3" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), suggesting that superhuman temporal resolution would not continue to improve pitch perception (at least as assessed here). Discrimination thresholds for high-numbered harmonics were in fact slightly worse for increased cutoff frequencies. One explanation is that increasing the modelâs access to fine timing information biases the learned strategy to rely more on this information, which is less useful for determining the F0 of stimuli containing only high-numbered harmonics. Overall, these results suggest that auditory nerve phase locking like that believed to be present in the human ear is critical for human-like pitch perception.</p><p hwp:id="p-39">A common criticism of place-based pitch models is that they fail to account for the robustness of pitch across sound level, because cochlear excitation patterns saturate at high levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref></sup>. Consistent with this idea, frequency discrimination thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-4" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>) measured from networks with lower phase locking cutoffs were less invariant to level than networks trained with normal spike-timing information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-5" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, right).

We then trained and tested the 10 best-performing networks from our architecture search on these representations (transposing the nerve fiber and time dimensions to maintain the input size and thus be able to use the same network architecture). Increasing the number of simulated auditory nerve fibers by a full order of magnitude modestly improved thresholds but did not qualitatively change the results: networks without high-fidelity temporal information still exhibited abnormal F0 discrimination behavior.

The networks were trained on simulated auditory nerve representations of speech and music embedded in background noise. The best-performing networks closely replicated human pitch judgments in simulated psychophysical experiments despite never being trained on the psychophysical stimuli. To investigate which aspects of the auditory periphery and acoustical environment contribute to human-like pitch behavior, we optimized networks with altered cochleae and sound statistics. Lowering the upper-limit of phase locking in the auditory nerve yielded models with behavior unlike that of humans: F0 discrimination was substantially worse than in humans and had a distinct dependence on stimulus characteristics. Model behavior was substantially less sensitive to changes in cochlear frequency tuning. However, the results were also strongly dependent on the sound statistics the model was optimized for. Optimizing for stimuli with unnatural spectra, or without concurrent background noise yielded behavior qualitatively different from that of humans. The results suggest that the characteristics of human pitch perception reflect the demands of estimating the fundamental frequency of natural sounds, in natural conditions, given a human cochlea.</p><p hwp:id="p-66">Our model innovates on prior work in pitch perception in two main respects. First, the model was optimized to achieve accurate pitch estimation in realistic conditions. By contrast, most previous pitch models have instantiated particular mechanistic or algorithmic hypotheses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">38</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">40</xref></sup>. Our modelâs initial stages incorporated detailed simulations of the auditory nerve, but the rest of the model was free to implement any of a wide set of strategies that optimized performance. Optimization enabled us to test normative explanations of pitch perception that have previously been neglected. Second, the model achieved reasonable quantitative matches to human pitch behavior. This match to behavior allowed strong tests of the role of different elements of peripheral coding in the auditory nerve. Prior work attempted to derive optimal decoders of frequency from the auditory nerve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref></sup>, but was unable to assess pitch perception (i.e., F0 estimation) due to the added complexity of this task.</p><p hwp:id="p-67">Both of these innovations were enabled by contemporary âdeepâ neural networks. For our purposes, DNNs instantiate general-purpose functions that can be optimized to perform a training task. They learn to use task-relevant information present in the sensory input, and avoid the need for hand-designed methods to extract such information. This generality is important for achieving good performance on real-world tasks. Hand-designed models, or simpler model classes, would likely not provide human-level performance. For instance, we found that very shallow networks both produced worse overall performance, and a poorer match to human behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3" hwp:id="xref-fig-12-2" hwp:rel-id="F12">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-68">Although mechanistic explanations of pitch perception are widely discussed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">40</xref></sup>, there have been few attempts to explain pitch in normative terms. But like other aspects of perception, pitch is plausibly the outcome of an optimization process (realized through some combination of evolution and development) that produces good performance under natural conditions. We found evidence that these natural conditions have a large influence on the nature of pitch perception, in that human-like behavior emerged only in models optimized for naturalistic sounds heard in naturalistic conditions (with background noise).</p><p hwp:id="p-69">In particular, the demands of extracting the F0 of natural sounds appear to explain one of the signature characteristics of human pitch perception: the dependence on low-numbered harmonics. This characteristic has traditionally been proposed to reflect limitations of cochlear filtering, with filter bandwidths determining the frequencies that can be resolved in a harmonic sound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52" hwp:id="xref-ref-52-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">48</xref></sup>. However, we found that the dependence on harmonic number could be fully reversed for sufficiently unnatural sound training sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-11" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Moreover, the dependence was stable across changes in cochlear filter bandwidths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-6" hwp:rel-id="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). These results suggest that pitch characteristics primarily reflect the constraints of natural sound statistics (specifically, lowpass power spectra) coupled with the high temporal fidelity of the auditory nerve. In the language of machine learning, discrimination thresholds appear to partly be a function of the match between the test stimuli and the training set (i.e., the sensory signals a perceptual system was optimized for). Our results suggest that this match is critical to explaining many of the well-known features of pitch perception.</p><p hwp:id="p-70">A second influence of the natural environment was evident when we eliminated background noise from the training set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-6" hwp:rel-id="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Networks trained without background noise did not extract F0 information from high-numbered harmonics, relying entirely on the lowest-numbered harmonics. Such a strategy evidently works well for idealized environments (where the lowest harmonics are never masked by noise), but not for realistic environments containing noise, and diverges from the strategy employed by human listeners. This result suggests that pitch is also in part a consequence of needing to hear in noise, and is consistent with evidence that human pitch perception is highly noise-robust<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57" hwp:id="xref-ref-57-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-57">57</xref></sup>. Together, these two results suggest that explanations of pitch perception cannot be separated from the natural environment.</p><p hwp:id="p-71">The approach we propose here contrasts with prior work that derived optimal strategies for psychophysical tasks on synthetic stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58" hwp:id="xref-ref-58-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59" hwp:id="xref-ref-59-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-59">59</xref></sup>. Although human listeners often improve on such tasks with practice, there is not much reason to expect humans to approach optimal behavior for arbitrary tasks and stimuli (because these do not drive natural selection, or learning during development). By contrast, it is plausible that humans are near-optimal for important tasks in the natural environment, and that the consequences of this optimization will be evident in patterns of psychophysical performance, as we found here.</p><p hwp:id="p-72">Debates over pitch mechanisms have historically been couched in terms of the two axes of the cochlear representation: place and time. Place models analyze the signature of harmonic frequency spectra in the excitation pattern along the length of the cochlea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref></sup>, whereas temporal models quantify signatures of periodicity in temporal patterns of spikes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref></sup>. Our model makes no distinction between place and time per se, using whatever information in the cochlear representation is useful for the training task. However, we were able to assess its dependence on peripheral resolution in place and time by altering the simulated cochlea. These manipulations provided evidence that fine-grained peripheral timing is critical for normal pitch perception (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-9" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5C&amp;E</xref>), and that fine-grained place-based frequency tuning is less so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-7" hwp:rel-id="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Some degree of cochlear frequency selectivity is likely critical to enabling phase locking to low-numbered harmonics, but such effects evidently do not depend sensitively on tuning bandwidth. These conclusions were enabled by combining a realistic model of the auditory periphery with task-optimized neural networks.</p><p hwp:id="p-73">Our model is consistent with most available pitch perception data, but it is not perfect. For instance, the inflection point in the graph of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-26" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> occurs at a somewhat lower harmonic number in the model than in humans. Given the evidence presented here that pitch perception reflects the stimulus statistics a system is optimized for, some discrepancies might be expected from the training set, which (due to the limitations of available corpora) consisted entirely of speech and musical instrument sounds, and omitted other types of natural sounds that are periodic in time. The range of F0s we trained on was similarly limited by available audio data sets, and prevents us from making predictions about the perception of very high frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60" hwp:id="xref-ref-60-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-60">60</xref></sup>. The uniform distributions over sound level and SNR in our training dataset were also not matched in a principled way to the natural world. Discrepancies may also reflect shortcomings of our F0 estimation task (which used only 50ms clips) or peripheral model, which although state-of-the-art and relatively well validated, is imperfect (e.g., peripheral representations consisted of firing rates rather than spikes).</p><p hwp:id="p-74">We note that the ear itself is the product of evolution and thus likely itself reflects properties of the natural environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61" hwp:id="xref-ref-61-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-61">61</xref></sup>. We chose to train models on a fixed representation of the ear in part to address longstanding debates over the role of established features of peripheral neural coding on pitch perception. We view this approach as sensible on the grounds that the evolution of the cochlea was plausibly influenced by many different natural behaviors, such that it is more appropriately treated as a constraint on a model of pitch rather than a model stage to be derived along with the rest of the model. Consistent with this view, when we replaced the fixed peripheral model with a set of learnable filters operating directly on sound waveforms, networks exhibited less human-like pitch behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-8" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This result suggests it could be fruitful to incorporate additional stages of peripheral physiology, which might similarly provide constraints on pitch perception.</p><p hwp:id="p-75">Our model shares many of the commonly-noted limitations of DNNs as models of the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62" hwp:id="xref-ref-62-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63" hwp:id="xref-ref-63-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-63">63</xref></sup>. Our optimization procedure is not a model of biological learning and/or evolution, but rather provides a way to obtain a system that is optimized for the training conditions given a particular peripheral representation of sound.

To test if networks with better performance on the F0 estimation training task produce better matches to human psychophysical behavior, we computed the Pearson correlation between validation set accuracies and human-model comparison metrics for each experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-5" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, right-most column).</p><p hwp:id="p-186">To test if âdeepâ networks (defined here as networks with more than one convolutional layer) tended to produce better performance on the training task than the networks with just one convolutional layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3" hwp:id="xref-fig-12-4" hwp:rel-id="F12">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), we performed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing the validation set accuracies of the 54 single-convolutional-layer networks to those of the other 346 networks. To test if the âdeepâ networks tended to produce better matches to human behavior we performed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing the human-model similarity metrics of the 54 single-convolutional-layer networks to those of the other 346 networks. To obtain a single human-model similarity score per network for this test, we pooled metrics across the five main psychophysical experiments. This was accomplished by first rank ordering the human-model similarity metrics of all networks within experiments and then averaging ranks across experiments.</p><p hwp:id="p-187">These human-model similarity metrics were used to analyze two other experiments (in all others we used more fine-grained analysis of best thresholds and transition points, described below). To assess the statistical significance of changes in human-model similarity when networks were optimized with a learned âcochleaâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-11" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) or in the absence of background noise, we compared metrics measured from 10 networks trained per condition. The networks had 10 different architectures, corresponding to the 10 best-performing architectures identified in our search (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS1" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-1-2" hwp:rel-id="T1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We performed two-sample t-tests (each sample containing results from the 10 independently trained networks) to compare human-model comparison metrics between training conditions. Effect sizes were quantified as Cohenâs d and reported for all such tests that indicated statistically significant differences. Because human-model similarity metrics were bounded between â1 and 1, we passed the metrics through an inverse normal cumulative distribution function before performing t-tests. All t-tests and ranksum tests were two-sided.</p></sec><sec id="s4zc" hwp:id="sec-83"><title hwp:id="title-85">Statistics - analysis of best thresholds and transition points</title><p hwp:id="p-188">One of the key signatures of human pitch perception is that listeners are very good at making fine F0 discriminations (thresholds typically below 1%) if and only if stimuli contain low-numbered harmonics.

In each case we used two-sample t-tests, comparing either the F0 discrimination thresholds (log-transformed) for tones containing the first harmonic, or the lowest harmonic number where thresholds first exceeded 1%.

Mixed model ANOVAs were performed with training conditions (peripheral model and training set manipulations) as between-subject factors and psychophysical stimulus parameters (lowest harmonic number and stimulus presentation level) as within-subject factors. The specific pairings of these different factors were: stimulus presentation level vs. auditory nerve phase locking cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-14" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>), lowest harmonic number vs. training set spectral statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-14" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>), and lowest harmonic number vs. training set noise level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-8" hwp:rel-id="F8">Fig. 8</xref>).
