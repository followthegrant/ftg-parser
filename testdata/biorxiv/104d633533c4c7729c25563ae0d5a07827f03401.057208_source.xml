Action selection can be divided into two dimensions: (i) selecting an action among several alternatives, and (ii) choosing the response vigor, i.e., how fast the selected action should be executed. Previous works have addressed the computational substrates of such a selection process under the assumption that outcome values are stationary and do not change during the course of a session. This assumption does not hold when the motivational drive of the decision-maker is variable, because it leads to changes in the values of the outcomes, e.g., satiety decreases the value of the outcome. Here, we utilize an optimal control framework and derive the optimal choice and response vigor under different experimental conditions. The results imply that, in contrast to previous suggestions, even under conditions that the values of the outcomes are changing during the session, the optimal response rate in an instrumental conditioning experiment is a constant response rate rather than decreasing. Furthermore, we prove that the uncertainty of the decision-maker about the duration of the session explains the commonly observed decrease in response rates within a session. We also show that when the environment consists of multiple outcomes, the model explains probability matching as well as maximisation choice strategies. These results, therefore, provide a quantitative analysis of optimal choice and response vigor under variable motivational drive, and provide predictions for future testing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-1"><italic toggle="yes">Keywords</italic></title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">choice</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">responser vigor</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">reward learning</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">optimal actions</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Introduction</title><p hwp:id="p-5">According to the normative theories of decision-making, actions made by humans and animals are chosen with the aim of earning the maximum amount of future rewards while incurring the lowest cost (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">Neumann &amp; Morgenstern, 1947</xref>). Within such theories, individuals optimize their actions by learning about their surrounding environment and in order to satisfy their long-term objectives. Such a problem, i.e., finding the optimal actions, is argued to have two aspects: (1) choice, i.e., which action among several alternatives should be selected, (2) response vigor, i.e., how fast the selected action should be executed. For example for a rat in a Skinner box with two levers, where pressing each lever delivers a reward with a certain probability, the problem of finding the optimal actions involves selecting a lever (choice) and deciding about the response rate on the chosen lever (response vigor). High response rates can have high costs (e.g., in terms of energy consumption), while on the other hand a low response rate implies an opportunity cost since the experiment session may end before the animal has earned enough reward. Optimal actions provide the right balance between these two factors, and based on the reinforcement-learning (RL) framework and methods from optimal control theory, characteristics of the optimal actions and their consistency with the experimental studies have been elaborated in previous works (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Dayan, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">Niv, Daw, Joel, &amp; Dayan, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">Salimpour &amp; Shadmehr, 2014</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-6">A major assumption in the previous models is that the values of the outcomes are stationary, and they do not change on-line in the course of a decision-making session. To see the limitations of such an assumption, imagine the rat is in a Skinner box and has started to earn outcomes (e.g., food pellets) by taking actions. One can assume that as a result of consuming rewards the motivation of the animal for earning more outcomes will decrease (e.g., because of satiety effects) and, therefore, the outcomes earned will have a lower value, which can potentially affect the optimal choice and vigor (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Killeen, 1995b</xref>). Such effects, however, are not incorporated in previous models of response vigor, and it is assumed that the value of the outcomes is constant during the course of the decision-making session. On the other hand, the effect of such motivational changes on the choice between actions has been addressed in some previous models (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Keramati, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">Keramati &amp; Gutkin, 2014</xref>), however, their role in determining the response vigor has not yet been investigated. Here, building upon the previous works, we formulate the problem of response vigor and choice under changing motivational drives in an optimal control framework, and we derive the optimal response vigor and choice strategy under different conditions. We will show that even when the motivational drives are changing, the optimal response rate in an instrumental conditioning experiment is a constant response rate, and then we will elaborate how this prediction can be reconciled with the experimental data. The optimal predictions under different choice situations is also explored, and their relation to the empirical evidence is investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">The Model</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">The reward</title><p hwp:id="p-7">It is assumed that at each point in time the decision-maker has a position in the outcome space denoted by <italic toggle="yes">x<sub>t</sub></italic>, which represents the amount of outcomes gained up to time <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>. For example, if the outcome is water, <italic toggle="yes">x</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> = 1 indicates that one unit of water has been gained up to time <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>. For simplicity, we assume that only one outcome is available, and thus the outcome space is one dimensional. In the next sections the model will be extended to the environments with multiple outcomes. The rate of outcome earning is denoted by <italic toggle="yes">v</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub>, which represents how fast the decision-maker is moving in the outcome space (i.e., the velocity in the outcome space); for example if a rat is earning one unit of an outcome per unit of time then <italic toggle="yes">v</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> = 1. Furthermore, we assume that there exists a <italic toggle="yes">reward field,</italic> denoted by <italic toggle="yes">A<sub>x,t</sub></italic>, which represents the per unit value of the outcome for the decision-maker. For example if the outcome is food pellets, then <italic toggle="yes">A<sub>x,t</sub></italic> represents the value of one unit of the food pellet at time <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>, given that the decision-maker has already earned <italic toggle="yes">x</italic> units of food pellets. As such, <italic toggle="yes">A<sub>x,t</sub></italic> is a function of both time and the amount of outcome earned. This represents the fact that (i) the reward can change as a result of consuming previous outcomes (dependency on <italic toggle="yes">x</italic>); for example the reward of food pellets can decrease as an animal consumes more outcomes and becomes sated, and (ii) the reward of an outcome can change purely by the passage of time, as for example an animal can get more hungry by the passage of time, and therefore the reward of food pellets will increase (dependency on <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>).</p><p hwp:id="p-8">In general, we assume that <italic toggle="yes">A<sub>x,t</sub></italic> has two properties:

which entails that the values of outcomes do not decrease with the passage of time. This term, for instance, corresponds to the metabolic rate of the decision-maker. Given the reward field <italic toggle="yes">A</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">x,t</italic></sub>, the reward of gaining <italic toggle="yes">δx</italic> units of outcome will be <italic toggle="yes">A</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">x,t</italic></sub><italic toggle="yes">δx.</italic></p><p hwp:id="p-9">The dependency of the reward field on the amount of outcome earned is indirect and it is through the motivational drive.

The optimal rate is argued to be the result of a trade-off between two factors: the cost of lever presses, and the opportunity cost of a certain response rate. The cost component is expressed as a function of the delay between consecutive lever presses. That is, if the previous lever press has occurred <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic> time steps ago, then the cost of the current lever press will be:
<disp-formula id="eqn5" hwp:id="disp-formula-5" hwp:rev-id="xref-disp-formula-5-1 xref-disp-formula-5-2 xref-disp-formula-5-3"><alternatives hwp:id="alternatives-5"><graphic xlink:href="057208_eqn5.gif" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-5"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
where <italic toggle="yes">a</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">b</italic> are constants. <italic toggle="yes">b</italic> is the constant cost of each lever press, which is independent of the delay between lever presses. The factor <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>, on the other hand, controls the rate-dependent component of the cost. According to the above relation, the higher the delay between lever presses the lower the cost will be. However, a long delay has an opportunity cost, i.e., by waiting a long time the animal is missing an opportunity to earn rewards that potentially could be obtained during the delay between presses. The optimal rate, therefore, will be determined by a trade-off between the cost of a certain response rate and its opportunity cost.</p><p hwp:id="p-12">In the above framework, the target of the decision-making process is to find the optimal value of <italic toggle="yes">τ</italic>. Here, we express the cost as a function of the rate of outcome earning instead of the rate of action executions. We denote the cost function with <italic toggle="yes">K<sub>v</sub></italic>, which indicates the cost of earning one unit of the outcome at rate <italic toggle="yes">v</italic>. In the case of a fixed-ratio (FR) schedule of reinforcement, in which the decision-maker is required to perform exactly <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> responses in order to earn an outcome, or in the case of a random-ratio (RR) or a variable ratio (VR) schedule, in which the decision-maker is required to perform on average <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> responses to earn an outcome, the cost defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-5-1" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-5">equation 5</xref> will be equivalent to:

Unfortunately, experimental data on the effects of different parameters on response rates are not consistent across studies, making it hard to compare the optimal actions with empirical data. Besides that, there is a further complexity due to the inconsistency in how different experiments have calculated response rates. In general, in an instrumental conditioning experiment, the duration of the session can be divided into three sections: (i) outcome handling/consumption time, which refers to the time that an animal spends on consuming the outcome, (ii) <italic toggle="yes">post-reinforcer pause</italic>, which refers to a pause after consuming the outcome and before starting to make responses (e.g., lever presses).

Experimental manipulations have been shown to have different effects on the duration of these three sections of the session, and whether each of these sections are included when calculating the response rates can affect the measurement of the results.

On the other hand, when the decision-maker is uncertain about the session duration, as time passes within the session the decision-maker’s expectation of the session duration increases. This phenomenon, which has been previously elaborated within

which states that the rate of responding for the first outcome (the outcome with the lower ratio-requirement) is <italic toggle="yes">l</italic> times greater than the second outcome. These results are generally in line with the probability matching notion, which states that a decision-maker allocates responses to outcomes based on the ratio of responses required for each outcome (<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Estes, 1950</xref>). Probability matching is generally considered as a violation of the rational choice theory, since within this theory it is expected that a decision-maker exclusively works for the outcome with the higher probability (the lower ratio requirement). However, based on the model proposed here, <italic toggle="yes">probability matching</italic> is the optimal strategy and therefore consistent with rational decision-making.</p><p hwp:id="p-49">The above results, in fact, stem from the assumption that the cost of earning each outcome only depends on the rate of outcome earning in the same dimension, as expressed in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn25" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-25-1" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-25">equation 25</xref>.

As an example, imagine a concurrent instrumental conditioning experiment in which there are two levers available (left lever and right lever) and each lever leads to a different outcome. Here, the independence assumption entails that the cost of the current right lever press is determined by the time elapsed since the last right lever press and it does not matter whether there was a left lever press in between. Alternatively, one can assume what determines the cost is the delay between subsequent responses, either for the same or for a different outcome, i.e., the cost is proportional to the rate of earning all of the outcomes, and therefore, the cost takes the form <inline-formula hwp:id="inline-formula-2"><alternatives hwp:id="alternatives-37"><inline-graphic xlink:href="057208_inline2.gif" hwp:id="inline-graphic-2"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. This alternative captures the fact that the cost is a function of the delay between subsequent responses, either for the same or for a different outcome. In this condition <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn25" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-25-2" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-25">equation 25</xref> does not hold anymore and the cost of earning outcomes will not be independent.

This formulation allowed us to derive the analytical solutions of the optimal rate of outcome earning in a wide range of experimental conditions. The analysis was divided into two sections: (1) the situations in which the environment contains only one outcome, and (2) the situations in which multiple outcomes can be earned in the environment. In the first condition, the results indicate that if the session duration is deterministic and known by the decision-maker, then the optimal rate of outcome earning is a constant rate throughout the session. Although these results are consistent with the majority of empirical results, they are inconsistent with the studies showing that the response rates decrease throughout an experiment session. We further showed that the uncertainty of the decision-maker about the session duration can explain this effect. In the conditions that the environment contains multiple outcomes, the results indicate that the optimal trajectory in the outcome space can take two different forms: (1) if the outcomes in the environment are substitutable for each other (equivalent to the reward field being conservative) then the optimal trajectory is a straight line in the outcome space; we discussed that these results are consistent with both probability matching and maximization notions of decision-making; (2) if the outcomes in the environment are not substitutable for each other, then the optimal trajectory is a straight line followed by a circular trajectory. To our knowledge, these results are the first analytical solution to the problem of choice and response vigor in the condition that the values of the outcomes can vary in the decision-making session.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F4" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-4-1 xref-fig-4-2"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;057208v1/FIG4</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F4</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig4</object-id><label><italic toggle="yes">Figure 4</italic>.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-4"><p hwp:id="p-56">The optimal trajectories in the outcome space when the reward field is non-conservative. o1 and o2 are two different outcomes, where the amount of reward that <italic toggle="yes">o</italic><sub>2</sub> generates is larger than the decrement it creates in the motivational drive.

Firstly, although the effect of between-session changes in the motivational drive on response vigor has been addressed in the previous models (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">Niv, Joel, &amp; Dayan, 2006</xref>), the effects of the on-line changes in the motivational drive within a session are not addressed in the previous works, which we address in this model. Secondly, previous works conceptualized the structure of the task as a semi-Markov decision process, and derived the optimal actions that maximize the average reward per unit of time (average reward). Here, we used a variational analysis to calculate the optimal actions that maximize the reward earned within the session. One benefit of the approach taken in the previous works is that it extends naturally to a wide range of instrumental conditioning schedules such as interval schedules, while the extension of the model proposed here to the case of interval schedules is not trivial. Optimizing the average reward (as adopted in the previous works) is equivalent to the maximization of the reward in an infinite-horizon time scale, i.e., the session duration is unlimited; in contrast, the model used here explicitly represents the duration of the session, which as we showed plays an important role in the pattern of responses.</p><p hwp:id="p-58">We assumed that the cost is only a function of the rate of earning outcomes, and it is time-independent (∂<italic toggle="yes">k</italic><sub>v</sub>/∂<sub><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></sub> = 0). However, in general one can assume that as time passes within a session, the cost of taking actions will be increased because of factors such as effector fatigue. Here we made the time-independence assumption based on previous studies that showed factors such as effector fatigue have a negligible effect on response rates (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">McSweeney, Hinson, &amp; Cannon, 1996</xref>). Similarly, in the derivation of <xref ref-type="statement" rid="theorem2" hwp:id="xref-statement-2-1" hwp:rel-id="statement-2">Theorem 2–4</xref> we assumed that the time-dependent component of the reward field is zero (∂<italic toggle="yes">A<sub>x,t</sub></italic>/∂<italic toggle="yes">t</italic> = 0), which seems to be a reasonable assumption, given the typical duration of an instrumental conditioning experiment.</p><p hwp:id="p-59">The value of the outcomes can change because of factors other than changes in the motivational drive, such as specific satiety.

The aim is to prove <xref ref-type="statement" rid="theorem4" hwp:id="xref-statement-4-3" hwp:rel-id="statement-4">Theorem 4</xref>. We have:

and based on <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn26" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-26-2" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-26">equation 26</xref> we get:

Defining <italic toggle="yes">w</italic> = (<italic toggle="yes">l</italic> − 1)/<italic toggle="yes">m</italic>, the solution to the above set of differential equations has the form:
<disp-formula id="eqn85" hwp:id="disp-formula-85" hwp:rev-id="xref-disp-formula-85-1 xref-disp-formula-85-2"><alternatives hwp:id="alternatives-87"><graphic xlink:href="057208_eqn85.gif" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-89"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
which is an arc of a circle centered at [<italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub>1</sub>; <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub>2</sub>], and <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> are free parameters. The parameters can be determined using the boundary condition imposed by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn24" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-24-3" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-24">equation 24</xref>, and also assuming that the initial position is <bold>x</bold> = 0. The boundary condition in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn24" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-24-4" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-24">equation 24</xref> implies:
<disp-formula id="eqn86" hwp:id="disp-formula-86"><alternatives hwp:id="alternatives-88"><graphic xlink:href="057208_eqn86.gif" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-90"/></alternatives></disp-formula>
which implies that at the end of the trajectory the rate of earning the second outcome is <italic toggle="yes">l</italic> times larger than the first outcome. Therefore, the general from of the trajectory will be an arc starting from the origin and ending along the above direction. Given the constrain that <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> ≥ 0 only the solutions in which <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub>2</sub> ≤ 0 are acceptable ones (i.e., the center of the circle is below the x-axis). Solving <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn85" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-85-1" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-85">equation 85</xref> for <italic toggle="yes">q</italic><sub>2</sub> ≤ 0 we get:

and therefore <italic toggle="yes">T<sub>c</sub></italic> is independent of <italic toggle="yes">H</italic> (the initial motivational drive). As such if <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> satisfies <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn87" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-87-1" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-87">equation 87</xref> then the optimal trajectory will be an arc of a circle starting from the origin. Otherwise, if <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> &gt; <italic toggle="yes">T<sub>c</sub></italic>, the optimal trajectory will be composed of two segments. In the first segment, <italic toggle="yes">v</italic><sub>1</sub> will take the boundary condition <italic toggle="yes">v</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0 and the decision-maker earns only the second outcome (the outcome with the higher reward effect). The first segment continues until the remaining time in the session satisfies <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn87" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-87-2" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-87">equation 87</xref> (the remaining time is less than <italic toggle="yes">T<sub>c</sub></italic>), after which the second segment starts, which is an arc of a circle defined by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn85" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-85-2" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-85">equation 85</xref>. The rate of earning the second outcome, <italic toggle="yes">v</italic><sub>2</sub>, in the first segment of the trajectory (when <italic toggle="yes">v</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0) can be obtained by calculating the rates at the beginning of the circular segment. The initial rate at the start of the circular segment is as follows:

which implies that at the first segment of the trajectory we have:

which completes the proof of <xref ref-type="statement" rid="theorem4" hwp:id="xref-statement-4-4" hwp:rel-id="statement-4">Theorem 4</xref>.</p></app></app-group><fn-group hwp:id="fn-group-1"><fn id="fn1" hwp:id="fn-3" hwp:rev-id="xref-fn-3-1"><label>1</label><p hwp:id="p-79">In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn14" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-14-5" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-14">equation 14</xref> the optimal outcome rate is dependent on the initial drive (<italic toggle="yes">H</italic>) and the session duration (<italic toggle="yes">T</italic>), and therefore one might intuitively think that if for example half-way through the session the decision-maker re-calculates the optimal rate using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn14" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-14-6" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-14">equation 14</xref>, then it will get a different constant rate than the one it got initially at the beginning of the session, as <italic toggle="yes">H</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> will be different from the ones at the start of the session.
