But, so far no such drugs have been identified. CP and MMC which are used as standard anticancer drugs for various types of cancer are also used as standard drug to induce micronucleus and chromosomal aberrations in the anticancer research experiments.</p><p hwp:id="p-19">In the present study, Ulva extract showed protective effects against the clastogenicity of CP and MMC which was evaluated by micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assay. Cytotoxicity of CP and MMC was evidenced in the present study in the form of reduction in the mitotic index (Ml) and P/N ratio. Ulva extract at different doses enhanced the P/N ratio in MN study and Ml in CA study at certain instances which may be due to the stimulatory action of this extract on the cell division. In micronuclei test the combination treatment of extract with CP or MMC showed protection in a dose dependent manner. Maximum protection was observed at CP 50mg and extract 75mg. In case of chromosomal aberration also we could observe similar results that higher doses of extract significantly reduced total chromosomal aberration induced by CP and MMC. In both MN and CA test we observed CP was more effective in imparting protection compared to MMC. This can be explained that both CP and MMC belong to different class of drugs and their mechanism of interaction is also different. Our findings are in correlation with the earlier reports in which researchers observed in vivo protective effects of <italic toggle="yes">Spirulina fusiformis</italic> against CP and MMC induced genotoxicity and reported significant reduction in the chromosomal aberrations after treatment with algal extract <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref></sup>. In another study, Blue green alga <italic toggle="yes">Chloreila vulgaris</italic> reduced X-ray induced chromosomal damage in whole body irradiated mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref></sup>. Recent study on in vitro antigenotoxicity of <italic toggle="yes">Ulva rigida</italic> extract showed protection against induction of chromosome aberration, sister chromatid exchange and micronuclei by mutagenic agent MMC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-20">We presume that the protective effects imparted by Ulva may be due to the synergistic action of phytochemicals present in the extract. The different constituents of natural products interact additively or synergistically leading to significant antigenotoxic effects 27-29. As mentioned above, Ulva consists of phytochemicals such as chlorophyll, vitamins, flavonoids, beta-sitosterol etc. We understand that the nutrients and chemical composition may vary with the seasonal changes and geographical locations. These constituents individually have been tested for their antimutagenic and anticancer properties. Anticlastogenecity of chlorophyllin in different cell cycle phases in cultured mammalian cells was studied using chromosomal aberrations as the experimental end point. It reduced the DNA damage induced by ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) and the effect was cell cycle dependent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref></sup>. Chlorophyll a and b showed protection against MMC induced chromatid and isochromatid breaks in human lymphocyte cultures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref></sup>. Sarkar et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref></sup> reviewed the chlorophyll and chlorophyllin as modifiers of genotoxic effects.</p><p hwp:id="p-21">There are several reports on the antimutagenic and anticlastogenic properties of vitamins especially the vitamin-C, A and E. Vitamin-C mediated protection on cisplatin induced mutagenicity has been reported using bone marrow micronucleus and chromosomal aberrations assays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref></sup>. Vitamin-C, E and beta-carotene showed reduction in DNA damage induced by gamma-ray in human lymphocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref></sup>. In another study it was reported that vitamin-C and E induced reduction in rifampicin induced chromosomal aberrations in mouse bone marrow cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">36</xref></sup>. Beta sitosterol is gaining importance these days on account of its wide range of biological activity. Villasenor et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref></sup> reported that beta-sitosterol from <italic toggle="yes">Mentha cordifolia</italic> inhibited the mutagenicity of tetracycline in an in vivo MN study. In another study beta sitosterol reduced significantly the sister chromatid exchanges and MN induced by doxorubicin, it also showed reduction in the free radicals thereby giving cellular protection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">38</xref></sup>. These active ingredients might act at cellular level by enhancing the enzymatic action in order to detoxify the mutagens or inhibit the enzymes which take part in the formation of metabolites or scavenging the free radicals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">39</xref></sup>. The exact mechanism of protection is not understood; we assume that extract may or may not acting directly on the drugs or on its metabolites instead the phytochemicals present in the extract provides cyto-protective environment to the cells in order to protect from the damages caused by these drugs. Hence, we claim that using Ulva in diet may bring added benefits to the patients undergoing treatments with anticancer drugs such as CP and MMC. We conclude that further research on antitumor or antioxidant effects of Ulva extract needed to understand it’s health benefits which will lead to explore individual active ingredient with potential human therapeutic value.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-21">ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p hwp:id="p-22">The author wish to express sincere thanks to the supervisor Late Professor K.K.
