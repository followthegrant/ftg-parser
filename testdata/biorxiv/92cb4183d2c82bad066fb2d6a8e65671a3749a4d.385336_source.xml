Many bacterial species have enormous population sizes, disperse effectively around the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">Stoppe et al. 2017</xref>) and exhibit high rates of within-species homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Vos and Didelot 2009</xref>). Recombination acts to progressively break down non-random associations between markers (linkage disequilibrium), so that in large populations a natural null expectation is for there to be linkage equilibrium between sites. Nevertheless, in most species for which data is available, substantial genome-wide structuring of variation is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">Smith et al. 1993</xref>). Here we propose a resolution of this paradox, namely that large bacterial populations accumulate diversity progressively until that diversity acts as an effective barrier to genetic exchange between lineages.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">We examine the population structure of 21 bacterial species and find that only the Asian population of <italic toggle="yes">Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> is close to genome wide linkage equilibrium. We find that this population has undergone a recent increase in size. If this population size was maintained over evolutionary timescales would lead to a greater than 100 fold accumulation of diversity, to levels higher than found in any well characterized bacterial species. We propose that other environmental species with large census population sizes, for example <italic toggle="yes">Vibrio cholerae</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, may have been through a similar stage before accumulating diversity and then evolving mechanisms that disrupted free recombination.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">Specifically, we use pairwise genetic distances between strains calculated from genome sequences to estimate the recombination scaled effective population size <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic>, where <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub></italic> is the effective population size and <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> is the recombination rate per site per generation, an approach briefly introduced by Cui et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Cui et al. 2015</xref>). Here, we test the method using simulations and find that it provides accurate estimates in constant size populations for values of scaled recombination rate <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> (see below) of 5 or more, and responds to changes in population size or structure far more quickly than estimates of <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub></italic> based on nucleotide diversity. We apply the method to data from 21 species and find that some common species, such as <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>, have strikingly low estimates of <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic>, implying that recombination is inefficient in distributing diversity across the species, while for others the fit of model to data is poor, highlighting deviations from a freely recombining population. Only datasets from <italic toggle="yes">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic> gives <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> estimates greater than 100. The former has had a recent increase in population size, the latter experiences repeated bottlenecks associated with geographical spread of its human host, implying neither population is close to demographic equilibrium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">Inference approach</title><p hwp:id="p-7">Population genetics is a century old discipline that provides a powerful set of theoretical and statistical inference tools with which to interpret patterns of variation between closely related organisms.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Central to the theory is the concept of a population, which in outbreeding eukaryotes is set of organisms that share a common gene pool. The simplest models assume panmixia which is random mating of all individuals within a single closed population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">Wright 1951</xref>). In most animals and plants mating is structured by geography, however even low levels of migration between locations, of the order of one individual per generation, can prevent differences from accumulating, making random mating a reasonable first approximation for many species. Theory predicts that the level of genetic diversity in depends on the mutation rate and on the historical effective population size, which is the number of individuals that contribute to the gene pool in each generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Wang 2005</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Outbreeding eukaryotes receive genetic material from the gene pool when they are born and contribute to it when they reproduce. Individuals are more similar to immediate relatives than they are to other members of the population, but the proportion of the genome shared by descent from particular ancestors decays rapidly with each successive generation, declining from 1/2 for full siblings to 1/8 for first cousins and 1/32 for second cousins. In random samples from populations with more than a few hundred individuals, shared recent ancestry is rare and can be neglected in many types of analysis.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">Bacteria reproduce by binary fission and only receive material from the gene pool or contribute to it via homologous recombination. Many cell divisions can take place between recombination events, most of which only affect a small proportion of the genome. These properties mean that the concept of a gene pool or a population is less straightforward to define than for outbreeding organisms. It is still possible estimate effective population size <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub></italic> from the average nucleotide diversity <italic toggle="yes">π</italic>, based on the standard assumptions of population genetic theory but the assumptions are both less reasonable and harder to test for bacteria than for outbreeding eukaryotes, in which population boundaries can be delineated empirically using programs like STRUCTURE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Pritchard, Stephens, and Donnelly 2000</xref>). For example, nucleotide diversity in a species like <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> can be estimated for clonal lineages, phylogroups, species or for the <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia</italic> complex as a whole. These choices lead to very different values for <italic toggle="yes">π</italic> and hence for <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub></italic> and it is not obvious a priori which is most justified. All methods lead to estimates of effective population size that are many orders of magnitude smaller than the census number of bacteria.</p><p hwp:id="p-11">Here, we take a different approach which is to estimate a scaled version of the effective population size, <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic>. High values of <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> indicate that the population structure is similar to that of outbreeding eukaryotes. Informally, in eukaryotic population each individual is the product of a separate meiosis and therefore genetically distinct. <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub></italic> is the number of genetically distinct individuals that contribute in each generation, which is typically in the thousands or millions. <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> is designed to measure an analogous quantity; the number of genetically distinct organisms that contribute to the future bacterial gene pool. To this end, time is rescaled; <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub></italic> measures the rate of genetic drift per bacterial generation, while <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> measures the genetic drift in the time it takes for strains to become similarly distinct by importing half of their DNA by homologous recombination. The recombination rate of <italic toggle="yes">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> is 1.7 × 10<sup>-4</sup> per site per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">Yang et al. 2018</xref>), as expected number of differences between two strains that affected by recombination through <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> years ago is e<sup>_rT</sup>,it can be calculated that it takes around 4,000 years on average for half of the genome to recombine. Half of this time is approximately equivalent to a eukaryotic generation in the sense that two strains that shared a common ancestor 2,000 years ago will be about as related as siblings. This represents a very different time scale from that assumed based on bacterial generations. For example, in <italic toggle="yes">V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, bacterial doubling times are likely to be similar to those in <italic toggle="yes">V. cholerae</italic>, which have been estimated at around an hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">Gibson et al. 2018</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-12">We estimate <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> using the pairwise genetic distances between strains, based on a number of simplifying assumptions which are likely to good approximations in freely recombining bacterial populations but may break down in species where recombination rates are low or genetic exchange is structured by geography or lineage. Specifically, the calculations assume that recombination introduces many more changes than mutation, happens at the same rate throughout the genome and that each recombination event introduces unrelated DNA from the population into the imported stretch. If unrelated strains differ on average at <italic toggle="yes">d<sub>unreiated</sub></italic> nucleotides throughout the alignment, then the expected number of SNPs distinguishing strains with a common ancestor at time <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> in the past is <italic toggle="yes">d = dunreiated</italic> (1— e<sup>—2<italic toggle="yes">rT</italic></sup>).</p><p hwp:id="p-13">To use these times to estimate the effective population size, we assume that the genealogy of clonal relationships is generated by a coalescent model with a constant population size <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub></italic>. This model generates expectations for the times in the past at which common ancestors of strains in a sample lived. Specifically, in a sample of <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> strains, there are n-1 coalescence nodes. The age of the first node corresponds to the common ancestor of the two most closely related strains in the sample, while the n-1th node corresponds to the common cellular ancestor of all the strains in the sample.</p><p hwp:id="p-14">Coalescence theory implies that the expected time in the past at which the <italic toggle="yes">m<sup>th</sup></italic> most recent coalescence occurs is <italic toggle="yes">T<sub>m</sub> = 2N<sub>e</sub>(1/m —</italic> 1/n). These times can be converted into expected genetic distances <italic toggle="yes">dm</italic> using the formula above. We use the UPGMA algorithm to obtain <italic toggle="yes">n-1</italic> coalescence distances from the <italic toggle="yes">(n-1) × n</italic> pairwise genetic distances between strains and find the values of <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ñ</italic> (effective sample size, see below) that gives the best fit between observed and expected distances for the <italic toggle="yes">n-1</italic> coalescence nodes.</p><p hwp:id="p-15">Note that for bacteria with high recombination rate, the genome is likely to have been scrambled up sufficiently that strains will have inherited little or no DNA by direct descent from the common ancestor of the entire sample. This means that the genetic distances expected for the oldest coalescences plateau at <italic toggle="yes">d<sub>unreiated</sub></italic>. In plots, it is convenient to show the coalescences in chronological order, oldest first, to aid comparisons between datasets with different sample sizes (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The model assumes that the strains are randomly sampled from a homogeneous population at a single time point, but pathogenic clones, epidemic outbreaks or strains from specific locations are often overrepresented in real data, leading to oversampling of very closely related isolates, relative to their frequency in the global population. Therefore, in addition to <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> we estimate a second parameter <inline-formula hwp:id="inline-formula-1"><alternatives hwp:id="alternatives-1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="385336_inline1.gif" hwp:id="inline-graphic-1"/></alternatives></inline-formula> indicated the effective sample size, which can be considered number of samples that are not epidemic clones of each other.

For real data, estimating this additional parameter often improves the qualitative model fit considerably.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;385336v1/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><title hwp:id="title-4">Recombination scaled effective population size (<italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r)</italic> estimation of simulated constant populations under different recombination effects</title><p hwp:id="p-16">The panels indicate populations with recombination effects (R) of 0.5 (a), 1 (b), 5 (c), 25 (d), 50 (e).

FastSimBac assumes a coalescent model with initial population size <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>0</sub></italic>, which remains constant in the simulations shown in this figure. We fix the recombination tract length <italic toggle="yes">λ =</italic> 1000 and vary the rate of initiation of recombination events <italic toggle="yes">r*</italic> per 2<italic toggle="yes">N<sub>0</sub></italic> generations. We report the scaled recombination rate <inline-formula hwp:id="inline-formula-3"><alternatives hwp:id="alternatives-3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="385336_inline3.gif" hwp:id="inline-graphic-3"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. For low recombination rates, the phylogenetic tree is highly structured but becomes progressively bushier as <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> increases, and gives the impression of being a nearly perfect star for <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> = 50. For high <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>, estimated <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> is close to <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> and the observed genetic distances are well-fit by the model. For lower R, the fit is less good and the estimate of <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> provided by <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> is also less accurate. For these parameter values, the size and shape of the phylogenetic tree are highly variable between runs (not shown), and the poorer fit reflects this stochasticity as well as greater inaccuracy in the approximations made in converting between genetic distances and coalescence times.</p><p hwp:id="p-18">Further simulations of more complex scenarios (Figure S1) shows that <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> estimates reflect the current demography of the population that it is measured from more closely than estimates based on <italic toggle="yes">π</italic>, which is more influenced by past demography and migration to and from different demes. Figure S1a shows the effect of a population expansion on estimates of <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic>. At time 0, a single population with scaled recombination rate <italic toggle="yes">R</italic> = 5 splits into two. The blue population maintains the ancestral population size while the red population becomes 10 fold larger. 0.05 time units after the split the red population is only marginally more diverse than the blue one but its estimated value of <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> is 6 fold higher. The fit of observed and expected genetic distances is poor for the red population, reflecting the inaccuracy of the modelling assumption that there is a single unchanging population size. 0.2 time units after the split the estimate of <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> is close to its true post-split value for both populations and the model fit is substantially improved.

We obtained estimates of 453 for the Asian population of <italic toggle="yes">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and 1976 for hpEurope population of <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> but the other 19 species all had estimated <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> lower than 100.</p><p hwp:id="p-28">Given that panmixia is possible within bacterial populations, it becomes puzzling why it is not widespread.

Species with these characteristics are the most obvious candidates to be panmictic, but <italic toggle="yes">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> thrives only in warm brackish waters and has oceanic gene pools, implying historical limits on its dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">Yang et al. 2018</xref>), while <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> is only survives in human stomachs and shows geographic differentiation associated with historical migrations of its host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Linz et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-29">A further puzzle is there is no correlation evident between estimated <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> and nucleotide diversity <italic toggle="yes">π</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3b</xref>), which at equilibrium in a neutrally evolving population is predicted to equal <italic toggle="yes">2N<sub>e</sub>μ</italic>. For example, <italic toggle="yes">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> has similar diversity to <italic toggle="yes">V. cholerae</italic> and much lower diversity than <italic toggle="yes">V.vulnificus</italic>, both of which have estimated <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> lower than 50.

Specifically, high <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic>, if sustained, leads to an accumulation of diversity to levels higher than that observed in any species. We propose that an accumulation of diversity leads to the evolution of barriers to genetic exchange within the species that reduce <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic>. It follows that when populations with high values of <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> are found, this should have arisen recently on an evolutionary timescale.</p><p hwp:id="p-31">As proposed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">Yang et al. 2018</xref>), the Asian population of <italic toggle="yes">V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, VppAsia, has spread within the last decades due to human activity but has an ancestral range that spans coastal waters from India to Japan. The other <italic toggle="yes">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> populations that we have sampled, with different ancestral ranges have smaller estimated <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic>, perhaps because they have smaller or less fecund ranges or experience greater competition or more frequent demographic bottlenecks.</p><p hwp:id="p-32">Crucially, it seems that the ancestral population size of <italic toggle="yes">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> as a whole was smaller than currently found in VppAsia and more similar to that in the other populations. First, the site frequency spectrum of VppAsia, but not the other populations, is out of equilibrium and is approximately consistent with a demographic scenario in which the effective population size increased by a factor of 10 15,000 years ago (Figure S3). One possible scenario is that the end of the last ice age around 11,000 years ago created a habitat that existed till the present and that the population expansion implied by the site frequency spectrum is due to a demographic expansion at the end of the ice age. Second, <italic toggle="yes">r/μ</italic>, the number of bases imported for each mutation event, for the species has been estimated at 313 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">Yang et al. 2018</xref>) implying that if nucleotide diversity reached an equilibrium, consistent with the current value of <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> of VppAsia, this would predict a value of <inline-formula hwp:id="inline-formula-5"><alternatives hwp:id="alternatives-5"><inline-graphic xlink:href="385336_inline5.gif" hwp:id="inline-graphic-5"/></alternatives></inline-formula> implying that most synonymous sites should be variable and is far from the current value of 0.024 or indeed diversity levels in organisms in this study or indeed in any well-characterised bacterial species. Our simulation results show that estimates of <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> respond much more quickly to changes in demography than <italic toggle="yes">π</italic>. The equivalent argument is more complex in <italic toggle="yes">H. pylori</italic> due to its geographic population structure but levels of variation are clearly far from equilibrium, as illustrated by the substantial variation between populations that reflects bottlenecks associated with migration rather than current population sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Linz et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-33">Simulations of facultatively sexual organisms have shown that selection on multiple interacting loci can lead to populations being dominated by small numbers of clones, even in the presence of frequent recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Neher and Shraiman 2009</xref>). These simulations also show that a phase transmission from panmixia can take place due to a decrease in recombination rate or even an increase in population size.</p><p hwp:id="p-34">There are several mechanisms which might lead to similar phase transition like behaviour in bacterial populations as diversity increases. In (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">Cui et al. 2018</xref>), we observe nascent boundaries to genetic exchange between lineages of <italic toggle="yes">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> associated with differentiation into ecological types. This type of genetic differentiation is likely to be more common and more likely to lead to barriers to exchange in more diverse bacterial populations, which tend to have more diverse accessory genome complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">Andreani, Hesse, and Vos 2017</xref>). Such barriers can result in speciation but might also lead to genetic structuring within a single species, such as host specific gene pools found in <italic toggle="yes">C. jejuni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Sheppard et al. 2014</xref>). Another class of mechanism is changes in the pattern or rate of recombination. Recombination requires homology between donor and recipient DNA to be recognized by the cellular machinery and, in addition, most species have a mismatch repair system, which aborts the process if there are too many differences. Therefore, as homology decreases, so will recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">Falush et al. 2006</xref>). Mismatch dependent recombination is likely to be the main reason why <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> has an estimated value of <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> of only 12, implying that recombination is ineffective in reasserting variation across the whole species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">Didelot et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-35">Our arguments imply that many environmental organisms with large census population sizes are likely to have gone through a stage of high <italic toggle="yes">N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> values, similar to that currently observed in the Asian population of <italic toggle="yes">V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, before a phase-transition reduced the number of lineages circulating in the population, which also prevented a continuous increase in diversity. Support for this hypothesis could be provided by identifying species that have been through such a transition and characterizing the factors that currently mitigate against recombination between lineages.</p><p hwp:id="p-36">Despite decades of study by population geneticists, the factors determining the amount of diversity within species are poorly understood. Our results suggest that patterns of variation in bacteria are likely to be dynamic, with ecological and genomic differentiation, barriers to gene flow and demographic factors interacting with each other in complex ways to produce the wide variety of bacterial population structures that are observed.</p></sec><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-7"><title hwp:id="title-11">Material and methods</title><sec id="s5a" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-12">Genomic datasets used in analysis</title><p hwp:id="p-37">The genome sequences of 21 bacterial species were used in this analysis, including <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus thuringiensis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Campylobacter jejuni, Chlamydia trachomatis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Flavobacterium psychrophilum, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Leptospira interrogans, Neisseria meningitidis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas syringae, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus</italic>.
