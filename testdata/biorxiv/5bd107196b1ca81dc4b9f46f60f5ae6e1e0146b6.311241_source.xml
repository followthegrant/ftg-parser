In recent times, information theory has been successfully applied in several fields of science, in particular for understanding the dynamics of complex systems and characterizing adaptive social systems, such as dynamics of entities as individuals and as part of groups.</p><p hwp:id="p-3">In this paper, we describe a series of non-parametric information-theoretic measures that can be used to derive new insights about animal behaviour with a specific focus on movement patterns, namely Shannon entropy, Mutual information, Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kolmogorov complexity. In particular, we believe that the metrics presented in this paper can be used to formulate new hypotheses that can be verified potentially through a set of different observations and be complementary to existing techniques. We show how these measures can be used to characterize the movement patterns of several animals across different habitats and scales. Specifically, we show the effectiveness in using Shannon entropy to characterize the movement of sheep with Batten disease, mutual information to measure association in pigeons, Kullback-Leibler divergence to study the flights of Turkey vulture, and Kolmogorov complexity to find similarities in the movement patterns of animals across different scales and habitats. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these methods and we outline the challenges in this research area.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="20"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

It is a field that is devoted to studying the storage, communication and quantification of information founded by Claude E. Shannon in his influential paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>] and lies at the interface of mathematics, statistics, computer science and electrical engineering. While initial research in this field was mainly theoretical, we have witnessed a plethora of practical applications in the past decades. For example, concepts and techniques from this field have been used in several fields such as neurobiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>], pattern recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>], cryptology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>], bioinformatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>], quantum computing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>] and complex systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>] with significant success.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">Recently, due to technological advances, low cost miniaturized sensors have been increasingly adopted for tracking the behaviour of animals across different scales and habitats. These sensors include, but are not limited to, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, accelerometers and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. This has led to an explosion in the deployment of these sensors in different habitats, across scales by animal behaviour researchers. A natural consequence of this development is that it is now possible to try to quantify and understand a variety of aspects related to animal behaviour such as migration patterns and routes, feeding, reproduction and mating patterns, conservation, monitoring of endangered species, epidemic spreading, resource use, social behaviour and association. In the field of animal behaviour, GPS, accelerometers and cameras are the predominant sensors deployed to measure several behavioural properties of animals. We limit our discussion here to GPS sensors due to their ease of deployment and the apparent simplicity of interpreting the data they produce as well as their consequent popularity relative to other sensors. For example, GPS sensors have been used to study selfish herd behaviour of sheep under threat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>], the hierarchical structures of group dynamics in flocks of pigeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>], migration patterns in vultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>], productivity in cows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>], and social relationships in birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>] just to name a few.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">We believe that information-theoretic approaches can provide <italic toggle="yes">complementary</italic> insights in the study of animal behaviour. In other words, these approaches do not replace the existing ones, but they are able to provide additional information about animal behaviour patterns, especially in terms of movement, which are not apparent using other types of analysis. Probabilistic approaches are also usually more robust in presence of noise, a common feature of sensor data. The number of applications of concepts and techniques from information theory to analysis of animal movement in the literature is limited. However, information-theoretic metrics have been used in the past for example to study information flow in animal-robot interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>] as well as predator-prey relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>] in animals.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">In this paper, we discuss how four classic information theoretic metrics, namely Shannon entropy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>], mutual information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>], Kullback-Leibler divergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>] and Kolmogorov complexity (normalized compression distance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>] can be effectively applied to the study of animal movement and provide additional <italic toggle="yes">complementary</italic> insights about animal behaviour. In other words, we explore how they can be used as tools for studying animal movement data. Indeed, the goal of this work is not to introduce new metrics, but to demonstrate the potential in using information theoretic concepts to understand animal behaviour. We introduce each metric separately and then we discuss how each metric can be applied to a practical problem, by discussing a case study in detail. More specifically, we demonstrate how these metrics can be used to characterize the movement patterns of animals across different scales and habitats. It is worth noting that these methods do not provide new ground-truth information, but they allow for identifying emergent patterns and formulating hypotheses that can be verified for example by means of further experimental observations in the field. The case studies are mostly based on datasets from the Movebank database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-10">The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

However, there are other several definitions of entropy such as Rènyi entropy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref>] and Tsallis entropy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>]. The discussion of these metrics is outside the scope of the present article.</p><p hwp:id="p-14">Due to the noisy nature of most datasets, probabilistic metrics are becoming increasingly useful for modelling not only animal movement data but in general real world datasets to account for any form of uncertainty inherent in datasets of this nature such as missing data. Therefore, entropy can be used for assessing the overall welfare and well-being of animals instead of a metric like distance travelled. Most animals are known to have a regular activity-rest pattern except under highly unfavourable conditions or when they have some sort of impairment in their general well-being. This implies that animals are supposed to have a relatively high entropy except for the period of harsh conditions when they are either aestivating or hibernating. For this reason, entropy can be used to characterize the movement patterns of animals so as to assess the state of their health. In addition, it can also be used in lieu of tortuosity to describe how tortuous an animal’s path is using the turn angle as the input. The conditional entropy is an important element of the conditional mutual information and can be used for example in understanding swarm behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-15">In the following subsection, we will consider a case study illustrating a possible application of Shannon entropy to the study of animal behaviour and, more specifically, to the characterization of the movement patterns of sheep with neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2b" hwp:id="sec-4"><label>1.2</label><title hwp:id="title-7">Case study: Shannon entropy as a tool for characterizing movement patterns of sheep with neurodegenerative disease</title><p hwp:id="p-16">The detection of abnormal locomotion patterns is essential for the early diagnosis of a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Batten disease in animals. Sheep with neurodegenerative diseases such as Batten disease are known to exhibit repetitive behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref>] over time due to gradual loss of motor skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>] and social awareness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref>]. Here, we use Shannon entropy to characterize the movement patterns of a flock of sheep comprising sheep with a natural mutation for Batten disease and their age matched control (mean age of 2 years) group using the dataset of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref>]. We use the trajectory of each sheep sampled every second and compute the distance covered every ten minutes over eleven hours (20:00-7:00) each day for a total period of six days. This time window is chosen in order to minimize the influence of external environmental noise in the dataset. We further bin the resulting distance calculated in order to assign to each sub-intervals symbols. To bin the data, given that we are working with skewed distributions, we use the head/tail classification rule introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>] resulting in 12 bins. First we evaluate this approach on synthetic data where we create two synthetic sheep sampling their distance covered from some random generalized Pareto distributions. We create ten of these distributions with different parameters. The abnormal sheep is allowed to sample from just two of these distributions while the normal sheep is allowed to sample from all. Details of this can be found in S1 Appendix. We compute the entropy and results <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig 1A</xref>) show the normal sheep have a higher entropy compared to the abnormal sheep. We further compute the entropy for each sheep (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-1-1" hwp:rel-id="T1">Table 1</xref> in S1 Appendix) as well as the mean entropy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig 1B</xref>) for the two groups of sheep. Our results show that the Batten sheep on the average have a lower entropy than the normal sheep with p-values (ANOVA) (0.0076, 0.1042, 0.2628, 0.0065, 0.0234, 0.0205) across the six days respectively. The potential impact of uncontrollable environmental variables such as unfavourable weather conditions is significant and may influence the behaviour of the sheep especially because the experiment was carried out in an open field. Therefore, the result should be interpreted with caution. We compare the entropy of the two groups of sheep with their respective average distance covered in (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-3" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig 1C</xref>) and its mean variance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-4" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig 1D</xref>).

For this reason, mutual information can be used as a measure of association or social-grouping, for example in the characterization of leader-follower relationship, group coordination and, more generally, collective behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref>]. This can be further used to derive a social network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>] and its complementary to the gambit of the group approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">34</xref>]. Mutual information can be used to measure non-linear relationships between two variables. More formally, the mutual information of two discrete random variables <italic toggle="yes">X</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Y</italic>, with realizations <italic toggle="yes">x</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">y</italic> respectively, is given by:

To detect significant associations and minimize co-location by chance, a permutation test (random shuffling of associations) is often carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref>]. However, it is difficult to identify a general method for defining co-location. Also, the directional correlation delay time method (measures how long it takes for one bird to change direction relative to another) used by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>] in reconstructing pigeon flight network structure can only detect linear relationships leaving the non-linear relationships undetected. Previously in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">36</xref>], the authors used transfer entropy (measured directed transfer of information) to infer leadership in Zebrafish. We state here that its our aim to detect association using a bidirectional graph and not a directed graph where information flow and its direction is of utmost importance. In addition, transfer entropy may be of limited use in instances where the agents are constantly changing positions relative to one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref>].

We use the dataset of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">39</xref>] and select flight 8 as the result was discussed in the literature in detail. We compute the time-series of the turn angle of each bird followed by the pairwise mutual information of these time series of the nine birds involved in the flight to obtain a distance matrix (see Table 2 in S1 Appendix). As expected, there will always be a certain degree of association between all the birds in the flight, we use a randomization test to determine a threshold for significant pairwise mutual information (S1 Appendix). We further build a social network (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig 2A</xref>) to visualize the flight formation. Our result is consistent with two previous studies on pigeon flight. First, we observe that pigeons do show a hierarchical formation when in flight as seen in (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-2" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). This is a result consistent with the observations in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>]. Also, we were also able to detect the leader as node <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> during the flight which is the node <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> with one edge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-3" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig 2A</xref>)<sup><xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn" hwp:id="xref-fn-2-1" hwp:rel-id="fn-2">1</xref></sup> (see video of ground truth trajectory). This result is also consistent with the ground truth in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref>]. We compare this approach with three other methods: correlation coefficient, transfer entropy and Granger causality (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-4" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig 2</xref>). While it is not straightforward to compare the performance of the four methods, one basis for comparison concerns leadership. Mutual information shows the best performance in terms of leader identification accuracy followed by the correlation coefficient. It is not possible to identify the leader using the transfer entropy and Granger causality. We attribute the poor performance of the transfer entropy and Granger causality to the continuous change in positions of the birds when flying.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F2" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-2-1 xref-fig-2-2 xref-fig-2-3 xref-fig-2-4"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;311241v5/FIG2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig2</object-id><label>Fig 2.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-3"><title hwp:id="title-13">Flight dynamics of homing pigeons.</title><p hwp:id="p-24">Characterized by (A) Mutual Information(Kernel Estimator) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67" hwp:id="xref-ref-67-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-67">67</xref>] (B) Mutual Information(Discrete &amp; Continuous mixtures) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68" hwp:id="xref-ref-68-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-68">68</xref>] (C) Mutual Information(Kraskov Estimator) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69" hwp:id="xref-ref-69-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70" hwp:id="xref-ref-70-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-70">70</xref>] (d) Correlation Coefficient (E) Transfer entropy (Kernel estimator) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70" hwp:id="xref-ref-70-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-70">70</xref>] (F) Transfer entropy (Kraskov estimator) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70" hwp:id="xref-ref-70-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-70">70</xref>] (G) Granger Causality (p-value = 0.05) (H) Granger Causality (p-value = 0.001) (I) Granger Causality (p-value = 0.0001).

For example, it can be used for detecting behavioural change points and modes such as foraging, resting and travelling in animals by constructing a sliding window that moves across a time series while computing the KLD of the probability distributions of contiguous windows. This has implications for example in determining regime shifts, most especially for animals that move in non-homogeneous ways. In addition, it can also be used to identify points of change in landscape for animals who travel long distances over a heterogeneous landscape that affect their behavioural states. KLD has also applications in determining activity-rest patterns in animals.</p><p hwp:id="p-27">Another potential application is the use of KLD for monitoring the health of animals that co-exist in groups. This can be achieved by computing the pairwise KLD between the probability distributions of movement data of all animals in the group while seeking animals with a significant divergence from the remaining members of the group. This approach, when integrated with appropriate machine learning tools such as hierarchical clustering, can be used potentially to classify animals into healthy and non-healthy or automatic classification of animals into species.</p></sec><sec id="s4b" hwp:id="sec-10"><label>3.2</label><title hwp:id="title-16">Case study: Kullback-Leibler divergence as measure por predictability of Turkey Vulture annual movement patterns</title><p hwp:id="p-28">In this subsection, we demonstrate a potential use of KLD to a biological problem. KLD is indeed widely used as a measure for comparing probability distributions. Fore example, in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>] KLD is used to measure the divergence from the equilibrium behaviour of the blue tuna fish after a telemetry device was attached to it. In this case study, we use KLD to describe the movement patterns of the Turkey Vulture. The Turkey Vulture, is the world’s most abundant and widely distributed avian scavenger with a population in excess of five million individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">40</xref>]. We characterize the movement patterns of the Turkey Vulture (<italic toggle="yes">Cathartes aura</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">41</xref>] across several years by comparing how the movement patterns at the beginning of the year (January) vary relative to the remaining months of the year across the next three years. The bird by name Leo was chosen since we have movement dataset for several years. We extract up to three years worth of movement data corresponding to 666 data points per month or 28 days and convert the coordinates to distance covered in kilometers. We compute the Kullback-Leibler divergence (symmetric version) across several years and our results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-1" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig 3</xref>) show that the movement strategy of this bird is highly predictable. We observe from <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-2" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig 3</xref> that the Kullback-Leibler divergence across the three years is characterized by the presence of several peaks and troughs. The peaks represent the movement back to the breeding sites as well as the breeding season when there is little movement in the temperate regions of America. The troughs represent the migrating period when the birds migrate to tropical regions in search of food. These species of birds start breeding in the temperate regions such as North and South America where they have an abundance of food during the spring and this breeding continues until the onset of fall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">42</xref>]. In the colder seasons, these birds migrate to tropical regions where it is warmer and there is abundance of rain and food throughout the year. However, at the onset of spring around March, these birds migrate back to the temperate regions of America, where they are guaranteed abundant food and resources. We compare the KL divergence with the mean difference as well as the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) of the monthly movement data of interest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig 3</xref>).

All these datasets use the same 1 hour sampling period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">49</xref>]. First, we evaluate our approach on synthetic data details of which can be found in S1 Appendix. Results, with both short and long movement data shows we can separate distinctly the synthetic animals into groups based on the distribution from which they sample their velocities. Then, we compare the monthly movement patterns of all the 85 animals to find similarities by computing their pairwise <italic toggle="yes">NCD</italic> with the gzip compressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64" hwp:id="xref-ref-64-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-64">64</xref>] followed by hierarchical clustering of the resulting distance matrix (see S1 Appendix for details). The only metric used here is distance covered every hour, which we further processed to its binary equivalent (strings of zeroes and ones). We refrained from using the turn-angle here as it is an unreliable metric considering the noisy nature of most sensors. Our results (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-1" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig 5</xref>) show three groups emerge: those that live on land (zebra, elephant, springbok, jackal, sheep and buffalo), those that live in water (tortoise, sea lion and elephant seal) and those that fly (Albatross and Turkey Vulture). Amongst the animals that live on land, we notice there appears to be some similarity between the movement patterns of the elephant and zebra while others seem to organize into distinct groups of conspecifics. Therefore, we hypothesize that there might be a correlation between the feeding and movement patterns of animals. We observe a small number of unexpected classifications: for example, Vulture <italic toggle="yes">V</italic><sub>1</sub> was classified among the animals that live in water. A possible explanation is related to the fact that the dataset is noisy. To find long-term similarities among animals movement patterns we compare approximately one year movement data of 16 animals (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-1-3" hwp:rel-id="T1">Table 1</xref>) across six different species. We selected these datasets due to their temporal length. Results (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-1" hwp:rel-id="F6">Fig 6</xref>) show that there might be some similarities in the long-term movement patterns of vultures and jackals which are both scavengers. This supports a hypothesis that there might be a correlation in the movement patterns of animals with similar feeding habits.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F5" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-5-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;311241v5/FIG5</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F5</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig5</object-id><label>Fig 5.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-6"><title hwp:id="title-22">Hierarchical clustering of the pairwise NCD of 85 animals spread across 11 species.</title><p hwp:id="p-36">All the animals on average organize into three groups of those that live on land (green), those that live in water (red) as well as those who fly (blue).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="311241v5_fig5" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-14"/></fig><fig id="fig6" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F6" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-6-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;311241v5/FIG6</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F6</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig6</object-id><label>Fig 6.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-7"><title hwp:id="title-23">Hierarchical clustering of the pairwise NCD of 16 animals.</title><p hwp:id="p-37">These animals are spread across 6 species representing the movement patterns over a period of one year.

However, we would like to underline that these methods should be applied with caution given their inherent limitations. First, the issue of missing data remains a challenging problem due to logger failure or inability to regularly obtain position fixes. In addition, it suffices to state here that care must be taken while choosing the appropriate amount of data from which inference can be made. For example, let us consider the analysis of the similarities of the complexities of animals across different taxa and spatio-temporal scales. We identified similarity only in the long-term movement patterns of jackals and vultures. This phenomenon might not have been observed if datasets of shorter length had been used. Indeed the results derived from using the measures presented in this paper should always be evaluated considering the corresponding temporal scale of the dataset.</p><p hwp:id="p-41">We issue a caveat on estimating probability density functions (PDF) of continuous movement data. At the moment, most of the methods and tools available are based on the assumption of underlying normal distributions. Considering that continuous animal movement data often follows skewed (e.g., power-law or truncated power-law) distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65" hwp:id="xref-ref-65-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66" hwp:id="xref-ref-66-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-66">66</xref>], researchers employing some of the methods described here, for example the Kullback-Leibler divergence, should exercise appropriate caution while estimating the PDF of these distributions. In the present study, we took special precaution while computing the probability distribution for entropy by binning the data around several mean values of the data in the direction of skewness.</p><p hwp:id="p-42">Furthermore, appropriate methods for permutation and randomization must be used while determining a threshold, for example for the calculation of the pairwise mutual information between animals in a group.</p></sec><sec id="s7" hwp:id="sec-15"><label>6</label><title hwp:id="title-25">Conclusions</title><p hwp:id="p-43">In this work, we have demonstrated the use of a class of non-parametric information theoretic tools for studying movement patterns of animals and have showed how they can be applied by means of several animal movement datasets. First, we have demonstrated how Shannon entropy can be used to characterize the movement patterns of sheep with Batten disease where the distance covered every ten minutes was used as the basis for generating symbols to compute the entropy. The result shows that the Batten sheep have a lower entropy than their control counterparts. Then, we have described the use of mutual information for detecting associations in animals using pigeons as an example. Our findings show that this method can be very useful in lieu of the widely used gambit of the group approach as we were able to implicitly detect the leader from the flight data. We have showed how the Kullback-Leibler divergence can be used to characterize the movement patterns of the Turkey Vulture. From our results we were able to to evaluate the predictability of the Turkey vulture over time. Lastly, we have described a metric with foundations in the field of algorithmic information theory known as Kolmogorov complexity (normalized compression distance). We have used this metric to characterize the movement patterns of animals across different taxa and spatio-temporal scales with results suggesting there might be a correlation between the feeding and movement patterns of animals. These methods provide <italic toggle="yes">complementary</italic> insights in the study of animal behaviour. In particular, they can be used to formulate new hypotheses regarding animal movement. In other words, they provide additional information about animal movement that is not apparent using other types of analysis. This class of probabilistic methods is also usually more robust in presence of noise, which is inherent in location data.</p><p hwp:id="p-44">As part of our future research agenda, we plan to explore additional movement datasets as they become publicly available and, possibly, other types of behavioural datasets, for example from accelerometers, in order to show further how these information theoretic metrics can be used to obtain novel insights about the behaviour of animals in their natural habitats.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s8" hwp:id="sec-16"><title hwp:id="title-26">Supporting information</title><p hwp:id="p-45">S1 Appendix (PDF)</p></sec><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-27">Acknowledgments</title><p hwp:id="p-46">The authors would like to thank Professor Jenny Morton for her insight, valuable discussions, and for allowing them to make use of the sheep dataset in this paper.</p></ack><sec id="s9" hwp:id="sec-17"><title hwp:id="title-28">Author Contributions</title><p hwp:id="p-47"><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Kehinde Owoeye, Mirco Musolesi, Stephen Hailes</p><p hwp:id="p-48"><bold>Data Curation:</bold> Kehinde Owoeye, Stephen Hailes</p><p hwp:id="p-49"><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Kehinde Owoeye</p><p hwp:id="p-50"><bold>Funding acquisition:</bold> Kehinde Owoeye</p><p hwp:id="p-51"><bold>Investigation:</bold> Kehinde Owoeye, Mirco Musolesi, Stephen Hailes</p><p hwp:id="p-52"><bold>Methodology:</bold> Kehinde Owoeye, Mirco Musolesi, Stephen Hailes</p><p hwp:id="p-53"><bold>Project administration:</bold> Mirco Musolesi, Stephen Hailes</p><p hwp:id="p-54"><bold>Resources:</bold> Kehinde Owoeye, Stephen Hailes</p><p hwp:id="p-55"><bold>Software:</bold> Kehinde Owoeye</p><p hwp:id="p-56"><bold>Supervision:</bold> Mirco Musolesi, Stephen Hailes</p><p hwp:id="p-57"><bold>Validation:</bold> Kehinde Owoeye</p><p hwp:id="p-58"><bold>Visualization:</bold> Kehinde Owoeye</p><p hwp:id="p-59"><bold>Writing - original draft:</bold> Kehinde Owoeye</p><p hwp:id="p-60"><bold>Writing - review &amp;
