Advances in fracture management have slowed because translational barriers have limited generation of mechanism-based explanations for the healing process. When uncertainties are numerous, analogical modeling can be an effective strategy for developing plausible explanations of complex phenomena. We demonstrate the feasibility of engineering analogical models in software to provide plausible biomimetic explanations for how fracture healing may progress. Concrete analogical models – Callus Analogs – were created using the MASON simulation toolkit. We designated a Target Region initial state within a characteristic tissue section of mouse tibia fracture at day-7 and posited a corresponding day-10 Target Region final state. The goal was to discover a coarse-grain analog mechanism that would enable the discretized initial state to transform itself into the corresponding Target Region final state, thereby providing a new way to study the healing process. One of nine quasi-autonomous Tissue Unit types is assigned to each grid space, which maps to an 80×80 µm region of the tissue section. All Tissue Units have an opportunity each time step to act based on individualized logic, probabilities, and information about adjacent neighbors. Action causes transition from one Tissue Unit type to another, and simulation through several thousand time steps generates a coarse-grain analog – a theory – of the healing process. We prespecified a minimum measure of success: simulated and actual Target Region states achieve ≥ 70% Similarity. We used an iterative protocol to explore many combinations of Tissue Unit logic and action constraints. Workflows progressed through four stages of analog mechanisms. Similarities of 73-90% were achieved for Mechanisms 2-4. The range of Upper-Level similarities increased to 83-94% when we allowed for uncertainty about two Tissue Unit designations. We have demonstrated how Callus Analog experiments provide domain experts with a new medium and tools for thinking about and understanding the fracture healing process.</p><sec hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Author summary</title><p hwp:id="p-3">Translational barriers have limited the generation of mechanism-based explanations of fracture healing processes. Those barriers help explain why, to date, biological therapeutics have had only a minor impact on fracture management. New approaches are needed, and we present one that is intended to overcome those barriers incrementally. We created virtual Callus Analogs to simulate how the histologic appearance of a mouse fracture callus may transition from day-7 to day-10. Callus Analogs use software-based model mechanisms. Simulation experiments enable challenging and improving those model mechanisms. During execution, model mechanism operation provides a coarse-grain explanation (a theory) of a four-day portion of the healing process. Simulated day-10 callus histologic images achieved 73-94% similarity to a corresponding day-10 fracture callus image, thus demonstrating feasibility. Simulated healing provides a new perspective on the actual healing process and a new way of thinking about plausible fracture-healing processes. Our working hypothesis is that the approach can be extended to cover more of the healing process while making features of simulated and actual fracture healing increasingly analogous. The methods presented are intended to be extensible to other research areas that use histologic analysis to investigate and explain tissue level phenomena.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="34"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">Introduction</title><p hwp:id="p-4">Annually, there are approximately 15 million fractures in the United States, and a significant portion (10-15%) fail to heal properly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>]. Both numbers and costs are predicted to increase as the population ages and the number of osteoporosis-related fractures increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. Therefore, developing intervention strategies to stimulate fracture healing is expected to positively impact health. Many of the advances made in fracture management in recent years were in mechanical stabilization and biologic bone augmentation materials such as autogenous bone graft, synthetic bone ceramics, or demineralized bone matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>]. The clinical impact of biological therapeutic agents, such as bone morphogenetic proteins, has fallen short of expectations for largely unknown reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the gold standard, and most commonly used strategy for fracture nonunion treatment, autogenous bone graft, has not changed in the last 100 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>]. Introductions of new therapeutics have slowed despite expanded research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>]. Such ineffectiveness reflects significant translation barriers. The problem is not unique to fracture-healing research; it is encountered within many research domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>]. A translation barrier is created when knowledge and explanations of complex medical processes, such as fracture healing, are insufficient to identify a reliable, efficacious intervention strategy. A goal of the research described herein is to develop a new simulation-based approach for improving mechanism-oriented explanations of the fracture healing process.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Fracture healing is described as comprising two phases and three stages that overlap temporally over several weeks: anabolic and catabolic phases; and inflammatory, endochondral, and coupled remodeling stages. The dominant cell types and subprocesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>] change as healing progresses. Recent analyses of transcriptomes present during fracture healing have shown that most of the genes and signaling pathways that are involved in skeletal development in embryos are also expressed in cells of the fractured callus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>]. Consequently, some pathway components have become the focus of empirical research efforts to develop therapeutic interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>], despite the fact that there is no explanatory model of the fracture healing process.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">Core phenomena of embryogenesis and some types of tissue regeneration include the evolving small- and large-scale patterns that are readily apparent in recorded images. There has been considerable progress in developing goal-directed mechanism-oriented explanations for those phenomena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>]. However, stained tissue sections of mouse tibia fractures obtained at intervals of several days lack the hallmarks of orderly, organized evolving phenomena exhibited by embryogenesis. The strikingly less organized callus tissue obscures the ongoing order of the various subprocesses and their mechanisms. Part of the problem traces to limitations of experimentation. Healing of mouse tibia fractures typically spans four-to-five weeks. A major complication is that, within the same experiment, no two fractures are the same. Although the healing phenomenon is the same, the healing subprocesses within each callus as they unfold are unique. Large observational gaps coupled with the necessary limitations of standard histological techniques means that informative processes or phenomena may be missed. It is also plausible that informative phenomena—patterns and features—are being observed and recorded, but are not yet recognized as such.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">Analogous circumstances have existed in non-biological domains, and significant progress has been achieved by using computational and grid-based simulation methods to provide plausible representations of the missing processes and phenomena. For example, looking for improved insight into processes occurring at the interface of ecology and geomorphology, Fonstad opined, “we have thousands of such images, but no theories in geomorphology nor ecology can fully explain the patterns in any of them” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-8">The fact that callus mechanisms have been successfully healing bone fractures for more than 150 million years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>] implies the existence of a well-orchestrated, robust process. Similarities of callus and embryonic transcriptomes support that inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. If we accept the premise that fracture healing is a well-orchestrated, robust process, then we need to answer this question: how can we begin developing a theory about the healing process—even if initially coarse and somewhat abstract—so that we can begin theorizing about its orchestration? A clearly described phenomenon is a precondition for developing a theory intended to explain that phenomenon (see S1 File). However, we do not yet have a clear temporal description of the fracture healing process, or even for portions of the process. We do, however, have detailed descriptions of features of the process at different stages.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">With current technology, it is not feasible to measure callus development continuously. Likewise, it is infeasible to track the changing variety of local structures and cell types. Must we plead for more data, and then come back to the problem in another decade or two? Absent a plausible explanation and theory to test, more data may not be the answer. In discussing comparable issues at the ecology-geomorphology interface, Fonstad observed that, “both of these disciplines are data-rich … it is immediately apparent that both of these disciplines are far more theory-poor” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>]. Fracture-healing research is handicapped because it is relatively data-poor <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> theory-poor. So, although we can draw inspiration from the explanatory simulation methods used by Fonstad and others, their models and simulation methods are not directly applicable in advancing fracture-healing research.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">Given the increasing interest in increasing the clinical relevance of modeling and simulation research, it is not surprising that the number of such reports in which authors utilize histology images to support face validation and/or guide calibrations is increasing. The following are three recent examples. Marino et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>] utilized their model of lung granuloma formation to compare in silico granulomas to those of the nonhuman primate <italic toggle="yes">Macaca fascicularis</italic>. Gardiner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>] utilized an agent-oriented particle system at various granularities to simulate mechanical behaviors of cells and tissues. Simulations using selected parameterizations bore a remarkable resemblance to histological observations of an epithelial layer, cell clusters, and single cells. Ziraldo et al. describe an agent-based model of ischemia/reperfusion-induced inflammation coupled with pressure ulcer formation and progression in humans suffering from a spinal cord injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>]. Serial photographic images spanning several clinical stages were used to calibrate progression and healing of virtual pressure ulcers. Virtual pressure ulcers were interrogated to explore how and when an irritation might resolve or become chronic.</p><p hwp:id="p-11">The prospect of pulling together a start-to-finish tissue-level mechanism-oriented description of a fracture healing process, even one that is initially coarse-grain, seems distant. Why? It is a consequence of four interrelated obstacles arising from fracture-healing research using rodent models.</p><list list-type="order" hwp:id="list-1"><list-item hwp:id="list-item-1"><p hwp:id="p-12">Missing system information looms largest. Knowledge about the healing process is still sparse compared to that available in other areas of research, such as embryonic skeletal development. Histological observations made during even the most thorough wet-lab experiments cover only a small fraction of the temporal space of callus behaviors.

Yet the healing process is sufficiently robust so that callus variability is easily accommodated: absent disruption, bone restoration is always the end state.

However, those features may not be easily identified when a higher-level process comprises many subprocesses.</p></list-item><list-item hwp:id="list-item-3"><p hwp:id="p-14">Informative data that characterizes sequential feature changes are sparse at best. Most of the available data are measurements made at cell and intracellular levels.</p></list-item><list-item hwp:id="list-item-4"><p hwp:id="p-15">Pervasive uncertainties beyond callus variability obscure process order. Each mouse fracture can be observed histologically only once. In addition, the pace of healing processes is subject to several biological factors, such as age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>], along with a number of external factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>], notably diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>], smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>], and vitamin D deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>]. Controlling such factors both within and between experiments can be challenging and expensive. Consequently, distinguishing causes from effects can be problematic.</p></list-item></list><p hwp:id="p-16">Given those obstacles, knowledge is insufficient to describe, much less begin building a conventional molecular and cellular biology-based model of fracture healing. The most pressing current need is to develop strategies and methods to workaround and eventually overcome each of the above four obstacles. We conjectured that the software-based model mechanism methods, which we have used successfully in other contexts (e.g., see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>]), could provide the foundation for such strategies, even though, for those earlier applications, considerably more mechanism related fine grain knowledge was available. Briefly stated, the cited software-based model mechanism approach begins with a target phenomenon. We build an extant (actually existing, observable), working mechanism in software that is parsimonious and, based on a similarity criterion, exhibits essentially the same phenomenon. Doing so requires making no assumptions about the biology.</p><p hwp:id="p-17">But even when the mechanism is kept coarse grain, the space of possible software mechanisms capable of generating essentially the same phenomenon can be huge. So, biologically inspired requirements and constraints along with mechanism granularity limits are imposed incrementally to shrink and constrain possible model mechanism space. That process shrinks a large set of possible coarse grain mechanisms into a much smaller set of plausible, incrementally more likely and increasingly biomimetic, model mechanisms.</p><p hwp:id="p-18">For fracture healing we envision simulations generating plausible scenarios for how discretized features of a callus tissue section on one day might progressively transform itself into the corresponding tissue section features—target features—observed several days later. Wet-lab experiments can target differences in two mechanisms, where the resulting new evidence is expected to support one mechanism and falsify the other (as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref>]), further shrinking plausible mechanism space. At that stage, the surviving software mechanism can stand as a coarse grain theory for how a portion of mouse tibia fracture healing is occurring.</p><p hwp:id="p-19">To begin eroding the four obstacles in meaningful ways requires coupling the preceding methods with an important new capability: use image interpolation strategies to build plausible sequential image models of the same fracture at different stages of the healing process. A requisite for an interpolation strategy is having and aligning discretized coarse-grain models of tissue section images of tibia fractures from different mice at different times.</p><p hwp:id="p-20">We report results of a focused demonstration that meets the above requirements. We present results of workflows that support the feasibility of the approach, while also bringing its weaknesses into focus. For this demonstration, we limited attention to the critical interval from day-7 to day-10 during healing of a mouse tibia fracture and focused on discretized models of specific tissue sections on both days. From the latter, we obtained the initial state and final target state for our simulations. Biomimetic software mechanisms involving actions of quasi-autonomous tissue units spanning, typically, 5,000-6,000 time steps are responsible for simulated healing. Similarities (defined in Methods) between simulated and referent final states ranged from &gt; 70% to &gt; 93%, depending on the stringency of the similarity criterion. Despite the narrow focus, it is clear that a major benefit of the approach is demonstrating that simulation experiments can enable discovering, challenging, and improving theories of healing subprocesses.</p><p hwp:id="p-21">Because our approach and methods are unconventional, somewhat new, and still evolving, we present that information next under Methods to provide the context needed to present and discuss results. There are weaknesses and limitations associated with every aspect of our approach. Some are identified in Methods, and others are addressed under Discussion. We undertook this demonstration with the expectation that the more successful methods could be repurposed to begin lowering similar barriers faced within some domains of disease progression research.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">Methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-5">Approach</title><p hwp:id="p-22">We begin with a synopsis of our approach from a workflow perspective, as diagrammed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig 1</xref>.

The discovery effort would be greatly simplified if we could obtain collocated day-7 and day-10 tissue sections from the same callus (mouse 1), but that is infeasible. Instead, we used an evidence-based illustration (created by coauthor M.M.) of an envisioned tissue section of the mouse 1 callus on day-10 at the same callus location as the day-7 tissue section. Three domain experts (see Acknowledgements) judged it plausible and acceptable. Hereafter, we refer to the illustration as the day-10i tissue section. A square grid was used to discretize the day-7 and day-10i images. The area of tissue at each grid location was labeled as one of nine tissue types, based on staining and preponderance of cell types within that space. The result (stage 2) was a discretized coarse-grain model of the day-7 and day-10i tissue sections.</p><p hwp:id="p-25">Because we are at the beginning of this explanatory discovery process, we needed and selected a target region on which to focus (discussed further below under Target Region). From a simulation perspective, the target region has an initial state, which maps to the day-7 tissue section, and a corresponding final state, which maps to day-10i tissue section. During stage 4 we used the MASON simulation toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>] to create a 2D 25×25 Target Region initial state, in which objects representing tissue units are assigned to each grid space. We start with a 2D Target Region to limit uncertainty in tissue type identification and to adhere to our parsimony guideline. Stage 5 efforts focused on answering the following question: how do we enable the Target Region initial state to transform itself so that the arrangement of tissue types mimics the Target Region final state? The steps followed to answer that question involved iterative refinements and had two objectives. 1) Explore logic to be used by simulated tissue units that enable them to successfully transition into biomimetic final states. 2) In doing so, keep the logic simple and avoid process features that may appear non-biomimetic. Once we had evidence that reasonably biomimetic final states were achievable, we shifted attention to improving the simulated healing process sufficiently to achieve the following quantitative target Similarity value (stage 6): compositional and organizational similarity between simulated and Target Region final state is ≥ 70%. So doing would support the feasibility of achieving the long-term <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig 1</xref> goals. A simulation that uses concrete objects (simulated tissue units) to generate a process that is analogous to callus healing in several ways. It is a software analog of the healing process. We call the parameterized software a Callus Subregion Analog.

As healing progresses the mix of cell types within a microscopic area changes. Some areas may undergo multiple tissue type transitions. A working hypothesis is that each of the microscopic tissue types is engaged in somewhat different activities, which are integral to the overall healing process.</p><p hwp:id="p-30">The first stage 2 task was to select a square grid mesh size and overlay it on <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-4" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig 2A</xref>. Choice of mesh size was somewhat arbitrary. If it is too fine, there are fewer cells within the microscopic area and so the uncertainty in specifying the dominant cell type increases. If too coarse, the fraction of microscopic areas containing clearly distinguishable tissue types 4-8 decreases, rendering a single tissue assignment inadequate (and actions of the analog counterpart would likely require unique logic). A guideline for selecting grid size was that the cellular heterogeneity observed within the larger local callus area be reasonably preserved in the discretized image. For example, for a macroscopic region characterized by a heterogeneous mix of predominately of ~ 60% new marrow (gray) and ~ 40% osteoblasts (burgundy; new bone), the discretized image counterpart should be a mix of ~ 60% gray and ~ 40% burgundy tissue units.

We needed an image that plausibly anticipates the appearance of the mouse 1 fracture if it had been sectioned on day-10 rather than day-7.

The histological evidence suggest that, on the same day, different subregions within a callus can be at different stages of repair and may be progressing at different rates. Given that, a parsimonious strategy is to select separated target regions within the same callus and develop simulations for each in sequence. They would be treated as independent modules. Future work based on simulations of independent target regions will help bring regional issues into focus prior to engineering their merger. The process of merging initially independent modules into a unified model of a tissue healing process would occur further downstream.

Thus, in some cases, the decision to designate an 80×80 µm area of stained tissue section as either gray or burgundy can be arbitrary; two experts may make different assignments.

We limited attention to Von Neumann neighbors, the four TUs that share an interface. We identified 25 different types of initial-to-final state transition, along with six in which the TU at final state was the same as at initial state. Their frequencies are graphed in S1 Fig. For each transition type, we tabulated neighbors by type. We also tabulated how those neighbors transitioned from initial to final state. We used that information to devise conditions that must be met before a particular type of transition could occur. Each time step, with probability = 0.05 (chosen based on expected frequency of transition), each TU, selected randomly, was given an opportunity to act. When a random double from [0.0 - 1.0) was &lt; 0.05, the TU stepped through its logic. Each TU transitioned to a final state only once. All transitions were completed within a few hundred time-steps.</p><p hwp:id="p-66">We developed and tested a variety of rules. The following is an example of the two-stage logic structure, which was explored most extensively. Upon selection of a white TU, the random double is &lt; 0.05, so it is given an opportunity to achieve its final state. It has three allowed transition options: white → gray, white → burgundy, or white → white. The above frequency data was used in advance to specify a probability for each option. Suppose that white → gray was selected. Specific conditions must be met in order for white → gray to occur. They are as follows. Are there ≤ 3 white neighbors, ≥ 1 green neighbor, or ≤ 2 gray neighbors? If yes, achieve final state by replacing self with a gray TU. If no, final state was not yet achieved. The vast majority of rules explored failed to enable the Target Region initial state to reach more than 50% Similarity to the Target Region final state. During time steps following that failure, one or more of its Von Neumann neighbors may transition. We explored allowing a TU that failed on its first attempt to have at least one additional opportunity to successfully transition during a subsequent time step, but that approach was abandoned when it became evident that many locations within the Target Region would need multiple transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s2h2" hwp:id="sec-13"><title hwp:id="title-15">Mechanism 2</title><p hwp:id="p-67">The healing process, which was well underway on day-7, created localized directional callus changes.

It exhibited non-biomimetic features. Rule details used in the final version were getting complex and thus deviating from our strong parsimony guideline. To enable achieving the targeted Similarity value and to produce a more biomimetic process, we inferred that each TU would need to be somewhat more fine-grained and use more location-dependent and goal-dependent logic. We retained the requirement that the probability to act each time step be the same (0.05) for all TUs. The Mechanism 2 directional probabilities were replaced by local vector values, which were refined during cycles through the IR Protocol. As an example, for the version of Mechanism 3 reported here, we specified that a blue TU could only cause a transition to the north, south, or east, and each direction was assigned a probability value. For blue TUs, those values were east = 0.6, north = 0.2, and south = 0.2. Once the location was selected, the TU type that would be the product on the transition was selected. The allowed transitions were those specified above. For example, a blue TU could transition to a teal or green TU but only when it had ≥ 4 blue Moore neighbors; otherwise, it remained blue. In Mechanism 3, green and white do not expand, but other TU types could generate them.

Our working hypothesis that a single, consistently applied TU logic could account for transition to the final state was falsified. Next, we tied the collision trigger to changes occurring within Target Region, which was intended to be reflective of changes occurring outside the Target Region. We specified that the collision be coincident with the first gray or burgundy TU reaching the northernmost row of active TUs, which we took as an indication that we had progressed sufficiently toward a simulated day-10 final state. Next, during that same time step, four blue invading TUs (blue*) were added to the central area of the rectangular region, three to the top active row and one to the row just below (variations on this theme work just as well).

The conventional strategy is to perform new experiments that generate new data and new knowledge. In doing so, one’s location shifts rightward and that shrinks the number and variety of equally possible and plausible explanations. Given the <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-9" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig 4</xref> reality, that approach is not available.

By so doing, we shrank the space of possible model mechanisms.

Thus, we are working within a marginally smaller possible model mechanism space. As demonstrated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-8" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref>], we can reduce the space of possibly explanatory model mechanisms more significantly by increasing the number and variety of targeted phenomena—validation targets—that require the analog system to satisfactorily simulate, and that is our plan for moving forward.</p><p hwp:id="p-97">The effort to keep the Callus Analog simple is where we encountered conflicting demands. To be scientifically useful and facilitate discovery, the Callus Analog must be sufficiently biomimetic in both model mechanism and generated phenomena. Increasing biomimicry requires that we make Callus Analog features finer-grain. However, making a Callus Analog finer-grain absent an evidence-based reason for doing so (as stipulated by the IR Protocol) risks dramatically increasing the space of equally possible explanatory mechanisms. Adhering to a strong parsimony guideline at step 2 of the IR Protocol helps resist that pressure.</p><sec id="s4a" hwp:id="sec-21"><title hwp:id="title-23">Simulated healing</title><p hwp:id="p-98">Each Callus Analog execution provides a record of an analog Healing Process, which is the top-level analog phenomenon. Executions generate the succession of changes by which earlier states of the Target Region gradually become a simulated Target Region final state. Each video explains how the initial state is transformed into a final state that is measurably similar to Target Region final state. It is too early to claim that strong analogies actually exist between temporal features of simulated and actual fracture healing for Mechanism 4. Nevertheless, we can draw new inferences, which can be investigated, and/or directly tested (in some cases, supporting/refuting evidence may already exist but has not been connected to the new inference). We can hypothesize that, at comparable levels of granularity, the simulated healing processes seen in the S3-S6 Videos have actual fracture healing counterparts. Suppose that we accept that hypothesis: the Mechanism 4 healing process and the actual corresponding fracture healing are strongly analogous. Given the logic detailed in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-6" hwp:rel-id="F7">Figs 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-6" hwp:rel-id="F8">8</xref>, what might one infer about the intra- and intercellular activities ongoing within (and between) each 80×80 µm area of callus tissue (corresponding to a Callus Analog TU)? Even though the cellular components within each area are typically heterogeneous, we would infer that their activities are tightly orchestrated. Further, continuously updated information about activities within neighboring tissue areas in all directions is needed to maintain those orchestrated, goal-directed activities. Simultaneously, those same cells are providing information about their own activities to neighboring tissues. When current information exhibits specific features, the cellular components signal the dominant cellular component within a particular neighboring tissue area to change its behavior in a particular way, i.e., initiate a transformation (e.g., hypertrophic chondrocytes in particular area are signaled to transform into osteoblasts). The different neighboring regions providing influential information may span a cross-sectional area as large as 240×240 µm (maps to a TU’s Moore neighborhood). Such information processing and distribution would require sophisticated, robust intercellular communication networks. However, there is no current evidence that such networks exist. On the other hand, there has been no reason to date to look for such evidence.</p><p hwp:id="p-99">Taken together, the S3-S6 Videos are low-resolution (coarse-grain) models of explanation— theories—that maps to a 4-day portion—day-7 to day-10—of the tibia fracture healing process in a mouse.

Two examples are the eastward progression of teal TUs replacing blue TUs and the eastward expansion of the mixture of gray and burgundy TUs. The mechanisms responsible for those intermediate level phenomena are mediated by the individual activities of the participating TUs. The logic dictating TU actions at each time step, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-7" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig 7C</xref>, provides Mechanism orchestration.

Some failures were marked by poor maximum similarity values. Others were marked by a feature within Target Region that was unexpected or judged non-biomimetic. In such cases, we would hypothesize a plausible explanation for the problem and a possible solution, and then conduct experiments to challenge that hypothesis and solution. When successful, we achieved an incremental Analog improvement. Failures provided new knowledge by enabling us to marginally shrink the space of plausible biomimetic healing processes. Mechanism 1 was unsuccessful because it was flawed in several ways. Nevertheless, observations made during IR Protocol cycles stimulated ideas for other logic that might be explored, including the ideas that drove development of Mechanism 2 and, later, Mechanism 3.</p><p hwp:id="p-102">From observations made during explorations leading to Mechanisms 1 and 2, we inferred that, in order to make simulated healing processes more biomimetic, it would be necessary to include two features. 1) Allow for multiple TU changes at any grid location during simulated healing. 2) Have sustained directional influences, spanning many TUs, guiding or constraining the direction and type of TU transitions. The latter may map to the combined net effects of multiple factors such as relative abundance and activity of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">43</xref>] signaling influencing osteogenic and chondrogenic transcription networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44" hwp:id="xref-ref-44-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-44">44</xref>], O<sub>2</sub> gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46" hwp:id="xref-ref-46-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-46">46</xref>], and mechanical influences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">47</xref>].

In this two-stage theory, chondrogenesis—cartilage development—serves chiefly as a means for producing hypertrophic chondrocytes, and they, in turn, initiate bone formation (carried out by other cells). However, a competing theory has emerged. Chondrocytes enter a transient stem-cell-like state from which they transform into the osteoblasts and osteocytes that form the new bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref>]. The earlier theory envisioned chondrogenesis and osteogenesis as separate processes, whereas the more recent theory is mechanistically simpler; it envisions chondrogenesis and osteogenesis as characteristic sequential features of the same process.</p><p hwp:id="p-107">All of the wet-lab observations on which those two competing theories are based are below the resolution of Mechanism 4. They are subsumed by the <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-8" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig 7</xref> logic. So, at this stage, we have no evidence for or against either theory. As we add new target attributes downstream, we envision replacing the <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-9" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig 7</xref> logic with model mechanism details using the tuneable resolution process of Kirschner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref>] (described below), and at that stage we should be able to challenge those competing theories.</p></sec><sec id="s4d" hwp:id="sec-24"><title hwp:id="title-26">Strengthening weaknesses; addressing limitations</title><p hwp:id="p-108">Because we are still early stage, the Mechanism 4-based simulated healing process comes with an ample supply of weaknesses and limitations. Both a weakness and limitation is that there are no (fine grain) 1:1 counterparts to the cellular entities and molecular level events that are the focus of the majority of wet-lab experiments. As Callus Analog credibility improves and finer-grain features are included as validation targets, it will become feasible to increase model mechanism resolution further utilizing Kirschner’s tuneable resolution process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref>], which is a systems biology approach for discretized multi-level, multi-compartment computational models. The process involves fine- or coarse-graining of entities and activities. Such an approach allows for the adjustment of the level of resolution specific to a question, an experiment, or a level of interest.</p><p hwp:id="p-109">The day-10i illustration is a stage 1 requirement. It is an important source of information but also a source of uncertainty. A requisite for building an explanation for fracture healing is having staged representations of the same fracture (e.g., on days 4, 7, 10, 14, 20, etc.) that are, within reasonable tolerances, reliable, semi-quantitative, and scientific. There are currently no protocols to achieve that requisite. However, many histologists, pathologists, and biologists are trained in accurately illustrating representations of specimens, including tissue sections. A logical next step would be to acquire two independently generated day-10i illustrations of the same section and then document where and why they are similar and different. Thereafter, we envision protocols and methods for developing credible staged illustration representations becoming increasingly standardized, and where feasible, automated. To increase standardization, we can draw from the robust best practices developed over decades for standardization of pathologic and histologic evaluations and reporting. We can also draw on the medical image registration methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51" hwp:id="xref-ref-51-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-51">51</xref>] that enabled rapid advances in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.</p><p hwp:id="p-110">Feature discretization and simplification at stage 2 helps manage uncertainties, but the process itself is also a source of new types of uncertainty. There is a risk that increasing or decreasing grid mesh density can alter analog-to-mouse healing process mappings in scientifically meaningful ways. A good future time to assess that risk will be when Callus Analog insights have advanced sufficiently to begin exploring for the first testable theory for fracture nonunion.</p><p hwp:id="p-111">The cellular components of all 80×80 µm areas within the day-7 tissue section Target Region are heterogeneous, but discretization requires that the corresponding analog grid space be occupied by one of nine TU types. To limit unintended bias, we can, as above, continue to draw from the mature best practices of pathologists to develop protocols to minimize added uncertainties. Longer term, we envision discretization protocols becoming automated. Near-term, several strategies can be explored to discover and ameliorate discretization weaknesses. Here are two examples. 1) Acquire two (or more) independently generated target region discretizations, and then independently develop an analog for each that achieves the same final state Similarity criteria. 2) There will always be instances where it will be difficult for a domain expert or an automated process to make some TU assignment, such as choosing between a new marrow TU (gray) or an osteoblast-dominated TU (burgundy), because those cell types are similar. In such cases, those grid spaces can be given a new designation, TU = g/b. At the start of each simulation experiment, all g/b spaces are randomly designated as either gray or burgundy. The result is a set of Monte Carlo Target Region starting states. One then cycles through the IR Protocol for each in parallel until the Target Region final state Similarity criterion is achieved. Both strategies require increased work, and automating IR Protocol tasks will help avoid reducing the overall workflow pace.</p><p hwp:id="p-112">Selecting an initial target region at Stage 3 was essential to demonstrate feasibility. Moving forward, the approach must be expanded in stages to cover the entire callus, possibly as follows. First, develop and improve simulated healing processes for small portions of a callus and then explore how best to merge them incrementally to simulate more of the fracture-healing phenomenon. It seems likely that multiple sub-callus processes will be needed to simulate healing within the entire callus. The evidence suggests that different callus subregions can be at somewhat different stages of repair and may be progressing at different paces. Separate simulations of independent sub-regions will help bring these issues into focus. A plausible next step would be to select a new day-7 target region (possibly larger than 25×25) and determine if Mechanism 4 is able to achieve a corresponding day-10i final state with Similarity values &gt; 70%. Following that, we envision extending those two analog healing processes forward to day-14 and backward to day-4.</p><p hwp:id="p-113">Each Mechanism 4 video is a sample from the circumscribed space of Mechanism 4-based model healing processes. Each is biomimetic. Are all other Mechanisms in that space also biomimetic? It is too early to answer, but it seems likely that the answer is no. Each video (the record of one Monte Carlo trial) provides a means to search for and address the emergence of non-biomimetic features. Observing more videos provides one with a better overall impression of the space of simulated healing. Domain experts observing videos can identify features that may be non-biomimetic, such as the small islands of teal and blue TUs within a gray/burgundy region in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-9-12" hwp:rel-id="F9">Fig 9A</xref> cited above. Features that appear in one video may not appear in another. Assume that domain experts identify a likely non-biomimetic feature in several Mechanism 4 videos. Mechanism 4 would be falsified. We would then seek a marginally different—yet still parsimonious—model mechanism in which the logic has been revised to avoid exhibiting the non-biomimetic feature and still meets all similarity criteria. The revised Mechanism would circumscribe a <italic toggle="yes">smaller set</italic> of analog healing processes. In the preceding scenario, the videos provide domain experts a new means of thinking about callus healing. More broadly, simulated healing provides a new perspective on the actual healing process, and it is from that perspective that we encourage the use of simulations to enhance the mechanism discovery process.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-27">Acknowledgements</title><p hwp:id="p-114">This work supported in part by NIH-R01AG046282 (R.M.) and the UCSF BioSystems group (C.A.H).

Discovering Biologically Explanatory Mechanisms.</bold> Forward/backward chaining reasoning strategies are described. They aid discovery of explanatory model mechanisms. Moving forward, we will rely on those strategies to expand Callus Analog to earlier (e.g., day-4) and later (e.g., day-14) stages of fracture healing. Mechanism is defined. To meet the definition of mechanism, the software mechanisms must exhibit the features listed in S1 Table.
