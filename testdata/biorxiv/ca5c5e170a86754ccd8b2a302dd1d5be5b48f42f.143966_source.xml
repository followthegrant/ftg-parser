Here we introduce a high-throughput screening method that allows highly diverse genotypes and the corresponding phenotypes to be imaged in numerous individual cells. To facilitate genotyping by imaging, barcoded genetic variants are introduced into the cells, each cell carrying a single genetic variant connected to a unique, nucleic-acid barcode. To identify the genotype-phenotype correspondence, we perform live-cell imaging to determine the phenotype of each cell, and massively multiplexed FISH imaging to measure the barcode expressed in the same cell. We demonstrated the utility of this approach by screening for brighter and more photostable variants of the fluorescent protein YFAST. We imaged 20 million cells expressing ~60,000 YFAST mutants and identified novel YFAST variants that are substantially brighter and/or more photostable than the wild-type protein.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p hwp:id="p-3">High-throughput screening of genetic perturbations is playing an increasingly important role in advancing biology and biotechnology. For example, by observing the effects of a large number of amino acid changes within a selected protein, large-scale screening can enable efficient searches for fluorescent proteins better adapted for bioimaging or protein and nucleic acid drugs with desired therapeutic properties. It can also enable the examination of how mutations of a protein affect cell function or physiology. Since each cell is composed of many genes, large-throughput screening can also allow the effects of inhibition or activation of individual genes or combinations of genes to be tested at the genomic scale, which will help decipher the effects of genes and gene networks on cellular behaviors.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">Large-scale screening efforts are greatly facilitated by pooled, high-diversity libraries of genetic perturbations because of the ease and scalability associated with the construction of these pools. By using methods such as error-prone PCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref></sup> or cloning with large, defined pools of array-synthesized oligonucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></sup>, it is often possible to create pooled libraries with a very large number of genetic variants or perturbations using a similar degree of effort as required to make any individual library member. The screening of pooled libraries then depends critically on the ability to measure not only the desired phenotype but also the genotype of the corresponding library members. The measured phenotypes can be simple in some cases, such as protein affinity as measured by standard pull-down assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>, or cellular fluorescence as determined by FACS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup>, and in both cases, the genotype can be determined via sorting or enriching library members with the desired phenotype followed by techniques such as sequencing to determine the genotype. However, there are many phenotypes that cannot be quantified with these techniques. Phenotypes ranging from cellular morphology and dynamics to the intracellular organization of different cellular components require high-resolution, time-lapse optical microscopy to be measured. Unfortunately, it has proven challenging to combine pooled library screening with high-resolution optical microscopy because it is difficult to isolate or recover individual library members based on their imaged phenotype and then determine their genotype. If, however, one had the ability to measure the genotype of individual library members also by imaging, then library member isolation and recovery would not be required, making it possible to combine the ease and scalability of pooled library screening with imaging-based phenotype measurements.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Here we report a novel high-throughput, imaging-based screening method that allows the characterization of both phenotype and genotype for pooled populations of genetically diverse cells. In this method, we associate each genetic variant with a unique barcode composed of a series of short oligonucleotide hybridization sites. After introducing the barcoded genetic variant library into a population of cells and measuring phenotypes with imaging, the cells are fixed and the barcodes are determined using multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a method that utilizes combinatorial labeling and sequential imaging to identify a large number of barcodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup>. We tested the feasibility and quantified the accuracy of this screening approach by screening a library of 1.5 million cells with 80,000 unique barcodes in which cells either did or did not express the fluorescent protein mMaple3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>. Based on these measurements, we estimated that our genotype misidentification rate is less than 1% for individual cells. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we utilized it to improve the brightness and photostability of YFAST, a recently developed fluorescent protein that becomes fluorescent upon binding to an exogenous chromophore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref></sup>. With this approach, we efficiently screened 20 million <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> cells containing ~160,000 unique barcodes and ~60,000 unique YFAST mutants, which resulted in the identification of YFAST variant with substantially increased brightness and photostability. By utilizing high-resolution imaging, we envision that this approach also has the potential to screen the effect of genetic perturbations on other cellular properties that would be difficult to measure with non-imaging methods, such as the morphology and dynamics of the cell, or the intracellular distributions of proteins/RNAs and the spatial organization of the genome.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">In our previous demonstration of MERFISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup>, we utilized this approach to massively increase the multiplexing of single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref></sup> and measure a large number of distinct RNA species simultaneously in single cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup>. We subsequently improved the throughput of MERFISH to allow a large number of cells to be measured in a short period of time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref></sup>. Here we reasoned that we could use this approach to identify the genotype of individual cells if each cell contains a unique DNA barcode that is associated with the gene variant of interest. Thus, cells could be identified by effectively measuring the identity of the RNA that it expressed from the barcode. To construct such barcodes, we designed nucleotide sequences that contain a concatenation of a fixed number of hybridization sites, where the sequence of each hybridization site was one of a pair of unique sequences associated with that site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We term these sequences readout sequences. Effectively each barcode sequence can be thought of as representing an N-bit binary code, where there is a unique readout sequence to represent a â1â or a â0â in each bit. Thus, each barcode is comprised of a set of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> hybridization sites drawn from 2N unique readout sequences: readout sequence 1-0, readout sequence 1-1, readout sequence 2-0, readout sequence 2-1, â¦, readout sequence <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-0, readout sequence <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-1. For example, a barcode sequence corresponding to the binary word 101â¦1 would consist of readout sequence 1-1, followed by readout sequence 2-0, then readout sequence 3-1, â¦, and finally readout sequence <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-1. A similar approach could be used to construct alternative barcodes using more unique readout sequences at each site, i.e. three sites would correspond to a ternary code, or using the absence of a site as a measurable signal, i.e. a â1â could be the presence of a site while a â0â could be represented by its absence.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;143966v1/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">A high-through, image-based screening method using massively multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization.</title><p hwp:id="p-7">(A) Schematic depiction of an RNA barcode. Each RNA barcode consists of the concatenation of a series of hybridization sequences, each of which can be associated with a different bit in an <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-bit binary barcode. Each hybridization sequence can utilize one of two readout sequences unique to that position, with one readout sequence associated with a â1â at that bit and another with a â0â. (B) Schematic depiction of library construction. The library of barcodes is merged with a library of genetic variants and transformed into bacteria. The correspondence between the barcodes and genetic variants is determined by sequencing. (C) Schematic diagram of the image-based phenotype-genotype characterization. The phenotype is first characterized in surface-adhered cells. Then, the cells are fixed, and multiple rounds of hybridization are used to measure the barcodes. During the first round, readout probe 1-0 is added and cells with barcodes that read â0â in the first bit, i.e. which contain the readout sequence 1-0, should bind to the probe and become fluorescent, whereas cells with barcodes that read â1â in the first bit should remain dark. Once readout probe 1-0 is extinguished, readout probe 1-1 is added and the cells with barcodes that read â1â in the first bit, which contain the readout sequence 1-1, should become fluorescent. This difference in fluorescence intensity allows the value of bit 1 to be determined for each cell. This process is repeated for the remaining bits. After measuring all bits, the barcode is determined, revealing the identity of the genetic variant contained in the cell and linking the measured phenotype to the genotype.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="143966_fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-1"/></fig><p hwp:id="p-8">As an illustration of one way in which this barcoding scheme could be used to identify genetic variants, we created a library of plasmids expressing these N-bit barcodes and a library of plasmids expressing a series of genetic variants of a protein of interest. To create a barcoded library of genetic variants, we fused the barcode sequences and the sequences expressing the genetic variants to create a library of new plasmids, each of which expresses a random combination of a genetic variant and a barcode, and introduced the library into <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> cells such that each cell only expresses one plasmid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) (see Materials and Methods for the details). To reduce the chance of a barcode appearing in the library associated with more than one genetic variant, we bottlenecked the diversity of the barcoded genetic variant library by limiting the number of cells expressing the barcoded genetic variant library to 1 to 10% of the total barcode diversity of 2<sup><italic toggle="yes">N</italic></sup>. We then determined which barcode is associated with which genetic variant by extracting these plasmids and sequencing them with next generation sequencing to construct a look-up table. These measurements also detected a remaining small fraction of barcodes that were each associated with more than one genetic variant. If detected, these barcodes were removed from further analysis.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">To screen this barcoded genetic variant library, we imaged cellular phenotypes while the cells were still alive (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-3" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Then, the cells were fixed without removing them from the microscope, and the RNA expressed from the barcodes were read out using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">During the barcode readout process, multiple hybridization rounds were used and fluorescently labeled readout probes complementary to each readout sequence on the barcode were hybridized in each round to detect which readout sequences are present in which cells. First, readout probe 1-0, complementary to readout sequence 1-0, was introduced so that it can hybridize to cells that contain readout sequence 1-0, namely the cells containing barcodes whose first bit is â1â, causing those cells to become brightly fluorescent. All the cells were imaged and then the fluorescence signal removed from the sample. Then, readout probe 1-1 was hybridized. Since every barcode contains either readout sequence 1-0 or readout sequence 1-1, the cells that did not become fluorescent in the first round should became fluorescent in the second round. The value for bit 1 for each cell was then assigned based on the fluorescence intensity ratio between these two rounds. This process was iterated until all <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> bits were probed. To reduce the number of hybridization rounds, we used multiple color imaging with spectrally distinct fluorescent dyes to probe for the presence of multiple readout sequences simultaneously in each round<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref></sup>. Three-color imaging was used in this work though a readout scheme using more colors is also possible.</p><p hwp:id="p-11">Since each cell expresses many copies of its corresponding barcode RNA, the fluorescence signal was very bright, and hence the readout error rate for each bit was very small. Thus, we did not find it necessary to use error correcting codes in this case, as we previously used for MERFISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup>, but instead all 2<sup><italic toggle="yes">N</italic></sup> possible barcodes could be used in principle. However, in practice, to avoid a barcode appearing paired with multiple mutants in the same library, we bottlenecked the number of unique library members, as described above. The use of only a subset of barcodes allowed the experimental measurement of the frequency with which unused barcodes were detected, which in turn allowed us to quantify the rate of misidentifying the genotype of a cell, as we describe below. With a constant degree of bottlenecking, this type of internal error measurement and error robustness is maintained even as the number of possible binary barcodes increases exponentially with the number of bits. Thus, this barcoding scheme should allow millions of unique barcodes to be measured with only tens of hybridization rounds.</p><p hwp:id="p-12">To test the accuracy of this screening approach, we created a library containing only two âgenetic variantsâ, the mTagBFP2 gene and the fusion of mTagBFP2 and mMaple3 genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Two barcoded libraries were created by merging a 21-bit binary barcode library, consisting of more than 2 million (2<sup>21</sup>) unique barcodes, with the two plasmids (one containing the mTagBFP2 and the other containing mTagBFP2-mMaple3 gene), one for each library, by isothermal assembly. Then, each of these complete libraries was electroporated into <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> cells, and a fixed number of cells were extracted to bottleneck these libraries to ~40,000 unique members. The plasmids were extracted from the cells and sequenced to determine which of the ~2 million possible barcodes were present in each library and, thus, associated with the presence or absence of mMaple3. Sequencing confirmed that in the mixture of the two libraries, ~80,000 unique barcodes were present, as expected, representing 4% of all 2<sup>21</sup> possible barcodes.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F2" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-2-1 xref-fig-2-2 xref-fig-2-3 xref-fig-2-4 xref-fig-2-5 xref-fig-2-6"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;143966v1/FIG2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig2</object-id><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">Performance characterization of the screening method by measuring 600,000 cells containing 80,000 unique barcodes associated with two known genotypes and phenotypes.</title><p hwp:id="p-13">(A) Schematic diagram of the library constituents.

We then fixed the cells with methanol and acetone and read out the barcodes in each cell using the procedure described above. We utilized alcohol fixation as opposed to crosslinking fixatives such a paraformaldehyde since it has been established that alcohol fixation greatly enhances the rate of hybridization to RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-15">During the barcode reading step, we examined the fluorescence signal observed for individual cells during different rounds of hybridization and imaging.

For all 1.5 million cells observed, a two-dimensional (2D) histogram of the bit 1 measurements, i.e. the fluorescence intensities determined in the probe 1-0 imaging round and probe 1-1 imaging round, was constructed, and this histogram suggests there are two distinct populations of cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-3" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The first population appeared bright when hybridized to probe 1-0 and dim when hybridized to probe 1-1 while the second population appeared dim when hybridized to probe 1-0 and bright when hybridized to probe 1-1. This observation is consistent with the readout sequence 1-0 being present in the first population and the readout sequence 1-1 being present in the second population. However, a substantial fraction of cells appeared dark in both imaging rounds, possibly because they are not expressing sufficient barcode RNA, or they are insufficiently permeabilized for readout probe hybridization. We therefore used a thresholding strategy to remove these dim cells from further analysis. Specifically, we require that the â0â or â1âreadout signal for each bit is larger than the median intensity observed for that readout signal across all cells. More than 600,000 measured cells satisfied this conservative criterion, and the barcodes expressed in these cells were determined. Among these cells, 84% of the measured barcodes matched a barcode contained in the library as determined by sequencing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-4" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-16">For the unmatched 16% of the cells, an experimental error must have occurred. Either the barcode was present in the library but it was not detected by sequencing or the barcode was not present in the library and an error occurred during barcode imaging that misidentified the barcode. While we did not use these cells in further analysis, the presence of this unmatched fraction can be used to estimate our experimental error rates in barcode identification. We first note that the library only contains 4% of all possible barcodes for the 21-bit binary encoding used, as described above, so assuming that a readout error in the imaging process is equally likely to result in a cell being assigned any of the 2<sup>21</sup> barcodes, there is a 96% chance that the error results in identifying a barcode that does not match one in the library (type 1 error). Next, we denote the probability that the barcode in a cell is incorrectly determined as x. Then this probability x multiplied by 96% should be equal to 16%, the fraction of cells that we found containing barcodes that did not match anyone in the library. Hence, x should be equal to 0.167 and the probability that the error results in a different barcode that is present in the library should be only 4% of x, which is ~0.67% (type 2 error). We note that only type 2 errors would affect our final results because only these errors have the capacity to generate a misidentified genotype. Type 1 errors would be detected as unmatched barcodes and discarded. Therefore, our estimated misidentification rate, i.e. the probability that both an error occurs and the error yields a barcode this is already present in the library, is less than one percent.</p><p hwp:id="p-17">The fidelity of the barcode measurement can also be verified by comparing the measured phenotype of cells from the mMaple3 fluorescence level to the phenotype predicted by the measured barcode. We used the phenotype measurements described above to determine the mTagBFP2 fluorescence intensity and the mMaple3 fluorescence intensity of each cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-5" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). All cells that contained the same measured RNA barcode were grouped and the median ratio of mMaple3 intensity to mTagBFP2 intensity was calculated for each group containing at least 5 cells. Since from sequencing we know which barcodes should be associate with mMaple3, we calculated the median intensity ratio for cells identified for each of these barcodes and constructed a histogram of these ratios. Using the same approach, we constructed a histogram of the ratios for the barcodes known to only be associated with mTagBFP2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-6" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). These two distributions are largely separated with only a small overlap. We set a threshold based on the intersection point of the two histograms such that the cells with fluorescence intensity ratios larger than this threshold were classified as containing the mTagBFP2-mMaple3 fusion protein and the cells with the intensity ratio below the threshold as containing mTagBFP2. We then compared these phenotype assignments based on fluorescence intensity to the genotypes based on the measured barcodes. We found that less than 1% of cells have a phenotype and genotype disagreement, indicating a rate of misidentification comparable to that estimated above. However, we note that this error rate is likely an overestimate since the natural spread in the intensity distribution of cells in each group should allow from some overlap of these distributions. Based on the above quantifications, we conclude that our high-throughput imaging-based screening approach is capable of accurately associating the phenotype with the genotype in a large number of cells.</p><p hwp:id="p-18">To demonstrate the utility of our approach for screening a large library of mutants to find proteins with desired properties, we screened for improved variants of a recently developed fluorescent protein, YFAST.

We note that while fluorophore brightness is a property that can be measured and selected via more traditional screening methods, e.g. FACS, photobleaching kinetics require a time-lapse measurement of the fluorescence from a single cell and, thus, would be challenging to perform with other approaches. In particular, we observed that the photobleaching decay of YFAST follows a double exponential decay with one component decaying much faster than the other. We sought to identify mutants that eliminate this fast decaying component.</p><p hwp:id="p-21">To measure the brightness of different YFAST variants while controlling for potential variations in the expression level, we fused YFAST variants to mTagBFP2 and imaged individual cells with both 405-nm and 488-nm illumination, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-2" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The relative brightness of YFAST was calculated as the ratio of the background subtracted YFAST fluorescence intensity measured with 488-nm illumination in the presence of the chromophore to the mTagBFP2 intensity measured with 405-nm illumination in the absence of the chromophore. To characterize the photobleaching kinetics of YFAST variants, we measured the decrease in intensity over 20 frames under constant 488-nm illumination alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-22">We constructed a series of YFAST variant libraries that contain (1) all possible single amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions (termed single-amino-acid libraries), (2) multiple mutations surrounding the chromophore binding pocket in each library member (chromophore adjacent library), (3) a combination of the best mutations identified from the chromophore adjacent library and the best mutations identified from the single amino acid libraries that are also near the chromophore, or (4) all possible single amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions based on a favorable mutant derived from the above libraries. In total, we constructed libraries containing roughly 60,000 unique YFAST variants associated with ~160,000 barcodes, and we used our high-throughput, image-based screening method to measure the brightness, photobleaching kinetics, and genotype for this library of variants across 20 million total cells. From each cellâs photobeaching decay curve, we determine the relative amplitude of the fast decay component (fast-photobleaching amplitude). We then grouped cells based on the genotypes measured and computed the median brightness and fast-photobleaching amplitude for each of these cell groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-4" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-23">We observe a wide range of relative brightness values and fast-photobleaching amplitudes. To confirm that these variations represent true phenotypic variability, we first selected two variants, the wildtype YFAST (green dot in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-5" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) and a variant with a much smaller (nearly eliminated) fast-photobeaching amplitude (blue dot in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-6" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), and plotted the measured photobeaching decay curves for the hundreds of measured individual cells that contained the two barcodes associated with these genotypes. The photobleaching decay curves measured for these two sets of cells clearly separate into two populations that correlate strongly with their genotypes, indicating a high degree of reproducibility in the measurements of phenotypes within individual cells. Next, we individually cloned these two YFAST variants and measured their properties in pure culture. We observe nearly identical improvement in photobleaching kinetics in these measurements as we did when these phenotypes were measured in the context of the variant library. By screening ~60,000 variants of YFAST, we identified mutants that are substantially brighter, or mutants that have eliminated the fast-photobeaching component, or mutants with improvements in both aspects (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-7" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3F, G</xref>). Moreover, because we have an exact genotype measured for each phenotype, we have produced a rich dataset of YFAST mutations and their phenotypic consequences that could be examined to extract information on both the biophysical properties of this protein as well as information that could guide future mutational screens.</p><p hwp:id="p-24">In summary, we developed a method for image-based screening of large genetic variant libraries by coexpressing the genetic variants and barcode that can identify these genetic variants in cells, and determining both the phenotypes of the genetic variants and the barcodes in the same cells using imaging. By reading out barcodes using massively multiplexed FISH, we demonstrated the ability to screen hundreds of thousands of barcodes that correspond to tens of thousands of unique genetic variations. Using this approach, we identified mutations in the YFAST protein, a recently discovered ligand-dependent fluorescent protein, with substantially improved brightness and photostability. We expect that this novel high-throughput, image-based screening method can be applied broadly to improving properties or identifying new properties of proteins and nucleic acids, as well as to deciphering the effects of genes and gene networks on cellular/organism behaviors at the genomic scale.</p><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-5">Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s1a" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-6">Barcode library assembly</title><p hwp:id="p-25">The barcode library consists of a set of plasmids, each containing a DNA barcode sequence that encodes a RNA designed to represent a single 22-bit binary word that is transcribed by the lpp promoter. Every barcode in the library has exactly 22 readout sequences, one corresponding to each bit, designed to be read out by hybridizing fluorescent probes with the complementary sequence. Although 22 bits are present in the barcode, to reduce the number of hybridization rounds, experiments were conducted reading out either 18 or 21 of the possible bits. For each bit position, we assigned one 20-mer sequence to encode a value of 0 and another 20-mer sequence to encode a value of 1. To aid quick hybridization, these encoding sequences were constructed from a three-letter nucleotide alphabet, one with only A, T, and C, in order to destabilize any potential secondary structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup>.

To determine whether a barcode contained a â1â or a â0â at each bit, the measured intensity of the â1â readout sequence and the â0â readout sequence for that bit were compared. Specifically, a threshold was selected on the ratio of these two values. If this ratio was above the threshold, the bit was called as a â1â. If it fell below, the bit was called as a â0â. Because the â1â and â0â readout sequences associated with each bit might be assigned to different fluorophores, it was necessary to optimize this threshold for each bit individually. This optimization was performed by randomly selecting 150 barcodes (a training set) from the set of known barcodes contained in the library, as identified by sequencing. An initial set of thresholds was selected and the fraction of cells matching these barcodes was determined. The threshold for each bit was then varied independently to identify the threshold set that maximizes this fraction. This optimized threshold set was then used for determining the bit values for all cells.</p><p hwp:id="p-42">Once the barcode was determined for each cells, cells were grouped by barcode and the median of the various phenotype values was computed to determine the measured phenotype for the genotype corresponding to that barcode. For YFAST measurements, the normalized intensity was determined by the ratio of the YFAST fluorescence intensities under 488-nm illumination in the presence of the YFAST chromophore to the mTagBFP2 fluorescence intensities under 405-nm illumination in the absence of chromophore. To account for the non-negligible fluorescence background present in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> upon 488-nm illumination, the magnitude of the background was subtracted before calculating the fluorescence ratio. The background was estimated by calculating the median intensity of all cells upon 488-nm illumination predicted to contain a non-fluorescent YFAST mutant. Cells, grouped by barcode, were assigned to the dark population if the Pearson correlation coefficient between the 488-nm intensity and the 405-nm intensity for the grouped cells fell below the arbitrary threshold of 0.2. When the two intensities are uncorrelated, it suggests the number of YFAST proteins in the cells associated with that barcode does not affect the brightness of the cell and hence the YFAST should be dark. To determine the relative amplitude of the fast decay component of the photobleaching measurement of each YFAST mutant, we fit the background subtracted photobleaching curve to the sum of two exponentials, with one of the decay rates set to the fast decay rate determined from the original YFAST. To determine the fast decay rate of the original YFAST, its background subtracted photobleaching curve was fit to the sum of two exponentials with both decay rates as adjustable parameters and the faster of the two decay rates was selected.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list hwp:id="ref-list-1"><title hwp:id="title-12">References</title><ref id="c1" hwp:id="ref-1" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-1-1"><label>1.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="143966v1.1" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-1"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Cadwell R.
