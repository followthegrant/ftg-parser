Here, we report years-long persistence of genotypes of the yeast <italic toggle="yes">Sacchaormyces paradoxus</italic> in space and time. Within 1 km<sup>2</sup> in a mixed hardwood forest on scales from centimeters to tens of meters, we detect persistence over 3 years of native genotypes, identified by SNPs genome-wide, of the wild yeast, <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic> around <italic toggle="yes">Quercus rubra</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Q. alba</italic>.

Additional transplantation experiments employed strains marked with spontaneous defects in the <italic toggle="yes">URA3</italic> gene, which also confer resistance to 5-Fluoroorotic acid (5FOA). Plating soil suspensions from transplant sites on 5FOA medium permitted one-step quantification of yeast colony-forming units, with no interference from other unmarked yeasts or microorganisms. After an initial steep decrease in abundance, the yeast densities fluctuated over time, increasing in association with rainfall and decreasing in association with drought. After 18 months, the transplanted yeasts remain in place on the nine sites. In vitro transplantation experiments into non-sterile soil in petri dishes showed similar patterns of persistence and response to moisture and drought. To determine whether <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic>, not previously recovered from soils regionally, can persist in our cold-climate sites, we transplanted marked <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic> alone and in mixture with S. <italic toggle="yes">paradoxus</italic> in fall, 2017.

And yet, remarkably little is known about their mode of life in forest soils. We report here that resident genotypes of the yeast <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic> are persistent of a time scale of years in their micro-habitats in forest soils. We also show that resident genotypes can be replaced by transplanted yeast genotypes. The high inoculum levels in experimental transplantations rapidly decreased over time, but the transplanted genotypes persisted at low abundance. We conclude that, in forest soils, Saccharomyces yeasts exist at very low abundance and that dispersal events are rare.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">In their review of the ecology and evolution of non-domesticated <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces</italic> species, Boynton and Greig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>) encouraged further investigation in nature to place them in ecological context with reference to the scientific model, <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic>, long-domesticated for food and beverage fermentation. Our focus here was on <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic>, the most tractable comparator of wild to domesticated <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces. S. paradoxus</italic> is associated with, but not limited to, oak leaf litter in forest soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>). In this yeast, progress has been made on understanding the relative importance of dispersal, genetic drift, and local adaptation in populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>), and the effects of substrate utilization on metabolism and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>). Saccharomyces yeasts are present in soil and plant material, especially bark of deciduous trees where they utilize exudates such as sap. Filteau et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>) have elucidated the genetic basis of a fitness determinant in <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic>: degradation of allantoate, the major nitrogen source in maple sap. However, there has been little information on absolute abundance of these yeasts in their natural habitat. Most information on the occurrence of wild yeasts in soil has come through enrichment culture in ethanol-containing medium, which cannot be used to estimate abundance. A major goal of this study was to measure the abundance over time of yeasts transplanted to their natural substrates at high initial densities.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Dispersal of <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces</italic> species between substrates is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>), but the recent work of Boynton et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>) suggests that lack of dispersal and prominence of genetic drift are more important in shaping local populations of <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic> than fitness differences among genotypes. <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic> may be dispersed by rainwater and by insects such as <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>), from which it has been isolated. Despite these potential dispersal mechanisms, there is genetic differentiation among <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic> populations that is roughly proportional to distance on a scale from centimeters to thousands of kilometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>). Despite progress in describing population-genetic structure and in documenting potential dispersal mechanisms, the extent to which wild yeasts actually grow and persist in stasis in their habitats in soil is unknown.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">In this study, we first followed naturally occurring genotypes of <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic> over a three-year period on a fine geographical scale of marked sites in a natural woodland. This extended the time frame covered by our earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>) by two years. This part of the study included only enrichment culturing and therefore registered only presence or absence, not abundance of yeasts. We then initiated transplantation experiments with yeast strains marked with spontaneous mutations. The transplanted yeasts in our study allowed quantification of colony-forming units per unit of soil and of change over time from an initially high level of inoculum. We found that abundance fluctuated, with an overall downward trend over time and that rainfall events were associated with a temporary increase in abundance. Even when abundance counts approached zero in some transplant sites, enrichment culture invariably recovered the transplanted genotype. Although our experiments focused on <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic>, we show that marked strains of <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic>, although not among the residents found in this locality, persist in proximity to transplanted <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-4">RESULTS &amp; DISCUSSION</title><p hwp:id="p-7">In 2014 and 2015, yeasts were collected by enrichment culture in ethanol medium from 72 sites around the bases of three oak trees and genotyped for SNP sites across their genomes.

In the present study, we sampled these 72 sites again in 2016 and a limited selection of eight sites again in 2017 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-1-1" hwp:rel-id="T1">Table 1</xref>), extending the sampling times of 2014 and 2015 reported by Xia et al.

Oak 2 showed an entirely different pattern of occupancy from that of Oak 1. Overall, less than half the sites at Oak 2 returned yeasts, but those that did included a broad diversity of genotypes, including: <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic> clade d, a hybrid lineage between two divergent lineages; an isolate of clade b, also a hybrid, but between more recently diverged lineages (clades a and c); clade e, a genotype of European origin, and three other yeast species, <italic toggle="yes">Lachancea thermotolerans, Torulaspora delbrueckii</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Pichia mandshurica</italic>. Oak 2 is also notable for the complete absence of clades a and c among the recovered yeast samples.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">Oak 3 and Oak 4 presented partial occupancy of sites, a predominance of clade c among the positive sites, and minority of clades a, b.

Overall, the pattern of persistence is extended at least through 2016, and is consistent with persistence in the limited sample into 2017.</p><p hwp:id="p-11">The previous re-sampling experiments examined yeasts in natural sites around the bases of oak trees by enrichment in ethanol containing medium; this culture method is not quantitative and only registers presence or absence, with some unknown threshold for detecting presence. In studying natural populations of <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic>, there has been a clear need for a method to quantify transplanted yeasts in situ. A recently reported method for quantifying yeasts in their natural habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>) used digital droplet PCR, which sensitively measures the ratios of the abundance of transplanted genotypes, but not their absolute abundance. In this study, we used strains marked with spontaneous mutations in the <italic toggle="yes">URA3</italic> gene, which conferred a Ura-, 5FOA-resistant phenotype. With this method, absolute abundance, colony forming units per g of soil, could be measured in one step by dilution plating on agar medium containing 5FOA, with no interference by growth of other soil microorganisms.</p><p hwp:id="p-12">We transplanted yeast populations of high density into nine sites around the bases of three additional oak trees (Oak 6, Oak 7, and Oak 8) in order to measure their abundance over time in the natural habitat. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the change in the composite abundance of all transplant populations over time. After a steep decrease in abundance over the first two weeks after transplantation, the levels fluctuated over time with seven of nine sites still registering counts one full year after transplantation and two of nine sites returned no CFUs. However, enrichment cultures at the end of the experiment, including those two sites registering no CFUs in the final plating on 5FOA medium, were all positive for the transplanted strains. The original resident yeasts on these sites sampled before transplantation (Table S1) would not be expected to appear on these 5FOA plates; whether or not the original resident strains remain on the transplant sites at low frequency is not known.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;305060v1/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-2"><p hwp:id="p-13">Outdoor transplantation of yeast strains and abundance over time.

For the first and larger of the two conspicuous rainfall events, between weeks four and six, all (nine of nine) populations increased in abundance (under the null hypothesis that increase in CFUs, or not, is a random behavior, the probability of the same directionality of response in all nine sites: P ≤ 1/ 2<sup>9</sup>, or 0.002). In the second event, between weeks 8 and 10, eight of the nine populations increased in abundance. At this stage, we interpret the apparent increase in population abundance with rainfall as a possible association, which is addressed below in a laboratory experiment. This transplantation experiment was not expected to distinguish whether the increase was due to reproduction of cells or to separation of aggregated cells because of moisture (driving up CFUs on the detection plates), or to some other mechanism.</p><p hwp:id="p-15">The outdoor transplants introduced yeast populations to a spot about 5 cm in diameter.

Here the abundance values clearly show that the plume of transplanted yeast cells had spread laterally. How this happened cannot be distinguished in this experiment. The yeast cells may have been washed outward from their central location with rainfall. This lateral spread may in part explain rapid initial decrease in abundance in the central location after transplantation. Actual reduction in viable cells may also contribute to the reduction in observed CFUs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F2" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-2-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;305060v1/FIG2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig2</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-3"><p hwp:id="p-16">Outdoor transplantation and relative abundance with distance in cm from the transplant site.

A final enrichment culturing at week 48, followed by testing on 5FOA medium, revealed that all nine plates harbored viable representatives of the originally transplanted strains. Under these conditions, the decline in CFUs could not have been due to spreading of the yeast populations as occurred in the outdoor transplantation sites. The decline of CFUs must have been due to a decrease in the proportion of viable cells or in their propensity to form aggregates (in which multiple viable cells that were aggregated would plate as one CFU).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F3" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-3-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;305060v1/FIG3</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F3</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig3</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-4"><p hwp:id="p-18">Indoor transplantation of yeast strains and abundance over time.

The plates were allowed to dry out at room temperature for three months. At this point, soil samples were taken for dilution plating on 5FOA medium and for enrichment culture. No CFUs were registered for this initial sampling; the transplanted yeasts had become rare. Nonetheless, the enrichment cultures were all positive for the transplanted yeasts (which had the 5FOA phenotype). Water was then added to the plates so that the soil became saturated, but without free water. Water was added to the plates twice per week to keep the soil saturated. Samples were taken at week 1 and week 2 two after the initial sampling. All plates registered CFUs and, for all replicates, the CFUs per g soil increased from initial sampling (0.0 ± 0.0 SE) to week 1 (1367 ± 519 SE), and to week 2 (2156 ± 764 SE). The effect in this in-vitro experiment was remarkably consistent with response to rainfall after a period of dryness in the outdoor transplantation experiment (null hypothesis, increase in CFUs, or not, is random; probability of the same directionality of response in all nine plates: P ≤1/ 2<sup>9</sup>, or 0.002).</p><p hwp:id="p-20">In a final experiment, we addressed the question of whether <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic> would persist in outdoor transplant sites, as did <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic>. The rationale for this experiment is that <italic toggle="yes">S. cerevisiae</italic> is not found in our study site or in northern latitudes in woodlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>).

The ratio of the two yeast species fluctuated around 1:1.

The first contribution is technical. Although our focus here was on persistence of yeast strains in their habitats, our transplantation experiments demonstrate the feasibility of long-term measurements of fitness effects in mixtures of strains in the field and in the laboratory. An advantage of transplantation to indoor microcosms with non-sterile soil is that the markers used to distinguish strains need not be limited to spontaneous mutations as was the case here for outdoor transplantation experiments. Targeted comparisons might involve specific gene deletions or modifications that would not be appropriate for outdoor transplantation.</p><p hwp:id="p-23">The second contribution is biological. Our observations that resident yeast populations persist over time with infrequent dispersal is entirely consistent with the scenario proposed by Boynton et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>). Our transplantation experiments are also consistent with a low level of dispersal, contributing a new dimension to our understanding of the carrying capacity of soil habitats for yeast populations. The initial high levels of inoculum in the transplantations were not sustainable. The CFUs per g of soil decreased precipitously in the first two weeks after transplantation and then more slowly, finally registering few or no CFUs on the 5FOA selective medium. And yet, enrichment culturing indicated that the original, transplanted genotypes were still on their sites in a viable state. Although the initial high levels of inoculum were not maintained, the transplanted genotypes persist and the transplants replace the naturally occurring yeast residents on those sites. Only by sampling the transplant sites in subsequent years can the limits of persistence be measured. Overall, our results are consistent with the idea that Saccharomyces yeasts exist at extremely low levels in the soil, with the possibility for limited population growth when temperature and moisture conditions in the soil permit. Against this prevalent pattern of stasis, the sudden availability of higher nutrient conditions, for example from sap flows, could lead to substantial growth in yeast populations with subsequent decrease in population density over time; our transplantation experiments were designed to simulate these high-growth events. We speculate that such chance amplifications in yeast populations would have more effect on long term presence than fitness differences among genotypes, especially where those fitness differences only relate to slight differences in growth rate measured under rich nutrient conditions in laboratory culture.</p></sec><sec id="s3" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-5">MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3a" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-6">Enrichment recovery of naturally occurring yeasts</title><p hwp:id="p-24">Our initial goal was to identify naturally occurring genotypes of <italic toggle="yes">S. paradoxus</italic> and to track their distributions over time.
