The potency of coastal ecosystems as carbon sinks is attributable to their high primary productivity, as they can produce 40% more plant biomass annually than the same area of forest (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>, <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>).

A defining feature of wetlands is periods of water saturation, with flooded sediments rapidly become anoxic. Anaerobic degradation of organic matter happens relatively slowly, and the rate of organic inputs from the vegetation occurs at a greater rate than losses by microbial respiration, resulting in a net accumulation of carbon in wetland sediments (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>, <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>).

The lack of an explanatory model for SVD development has driven most research to address the causes of SVD rather than the consequences of the loss of vegetation on the functioning of wetland ecosystems.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">We previously documented that sediment microbial communities differed between SVD-affected sediments and stands of healthy <italic toggle="yes">S. alterniflora</italic> at a coastal marsh in Connecticut, U.S.A (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>).

Taken together, these observations indicate that SVD resulted in alterations in both the structure and function of sediment microbial communities. Yet, there is little known regarding the spatial or temporal scales at which the shifts in the microbial communities occur, or whether alterations in sediment microbial communities are similar between geographically isolated wetlands.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">In the present study, we compared sediment microbial communities between two salt marshes both experiencing current outbreaks of SVD. However, the time since SVD development differed between the two sites (5 versus. 10 years). To examine the relative role of vegetation, we examined sediment microbial communities in summer (July) during peak plant activity, and in fall (October) when salt marsh plants begin senescence. We predicted that the microbial communities would differ between the two field sites due to biogeography, but would show similar responses to SVD, such that the sites experiencing SVD would potentially be more similar to each other than they were to healthy locations at the same field site. We further expected that the sediment microbial communities response to SVD would be muted in fall sampling, when plants in the vegetated plots were not active and producing root exudates for the microbial populations. In this manner, alterations in the coastal wetland sediment communities could be linked to spatial biogeography, and to temporal dynamics related to the time from disturbance, and seasonal plant activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">Results</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-5">Site descriptions</title><p hwp:id="p-9">Sediment samples were collected in 2015 from Hammonasset Beach State Park (hereafter referred to as Hammonasset) on July 22<sup>nd</sup> and October 8<sup>th</sup> of 2015 and at Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (hereafter referred to as Narragansett) on July and October 13<sup>th</sup>.

Sediments from Narragansett had higher soil moisture, greater electrical conductivity, and higher C and N content, indicating that tidal waters may have more frequently inundated the Narragansett sites (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-1-3" hwp:rel-id="T1">Table 1</xref>). While sediments were collected systematically along perpendicular transects from tidal creeks at both sites, it is possible that Narragansett SVD patches occurred lower in the tidal frame and thus were wetter, saltier, and enriched in organic matter, key factors driving microbial community composition.</p><p hwp:id="p-28">Previous studies have similarly found that geography is a large driver of bacterial community composition. Regional differences in Louisiana salt marshes were at least as large of a predictor of bacterial community composition as those between the rhizosphere of different plants (<italic toggle="yes">S. alterniflora</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Juncus roemerianus;</italic>(<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>)). Similarly, ammonia-oxidizing communities (bacteria and archaea) showed larger differences between regions associated with soil moisture and nitrogen content than due to contamination during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>). Despite biogeography being a large influence on sediment microbial communities, the structure of the sediment microbial communities was similar between the two field sites, being composed of the same dominant taxa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-4" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), harboring similar levels of microbial diversity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), and only a relatively small number of OTUs being identified as significantly different in relative abundance between the sites (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-2" hwp:rel-id="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). A subset of the differentially abundant OTUs belonged to taxonomic groups specifically enriched in a certain field site. For example, an OTU identified to the genus <italic toggle="yes">Mariprofundus</italic> was enriched at Hammonasset (Table S1). These organisms have been associated with a role in iron oxidation in marine systems (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>), and may point to differences in iron cycling between the sites. In contrast, several OTUs belonged to taxonomic ranks identified as more abundant in both field sites (Table S2). This could indicate that the differentially abundant taxa are largely functionally redundant but have adapted to the different biogeographic and edaphic factors that differentiate the two wetlands.</p><p hwp:id="p-29">Coastal wetlands are temporally dynamic systems. Diurnal cycles in the tidal cycle, light, and photosynthesis rates drive changes in the magnitude of sediment respiration (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref>). Up to 76% of the detectable methane emissions from coastal wetland sediments are released during tidal immersion (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref>). Finally, seasonal patterns result in large alterations in a multitude of environmental factors, including temperature and plant physiology. Carbon flux from sediments is generally lower in the non-growing seasons, even when accounting for lower average temperatures (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>) and plant activity in summer may regulate biogeochemical processes such as iron cycling (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>). Thus, these data support that coastal sediment microbial activity is largely driven by biotic and abiotic factors that vary at a variety of time scales. However, studies characterizing temporal patterns in microbial community assembly are notably sparse (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref>–<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref>). We collected samples in July and October to investigate if the sediment microbial communities showed significant changes in composition related to season. Date of sampling was insignificant as a factor clustering the sequence datasets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-3" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) and the OTUs in the datasets were present in similar abundances at both time points with no OTUs being identified as significantly different in abundance due to sample date (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-2" hwp:rel-id="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the sediment microbial communities were largely similar in summer and fall samples, suggesting a limited role for seasonal dynamics in shaping the sediment communities. The samples were limited to a two-point time course therefore a finer-grained analysis may be required to disentangle a more nuanced response of these communities to temporal cycles. Yet these observations suggest that while microbial activity is responsive to the temporal dynamics in coastal wetlands, alterations in activity may be a poor predictor of community composition.</p><p hwp:id="p-30">Finally, we employed the development of SVD as a natural experiment to assess the impact of an ecosystem disturbance on the sediment communities. At a landscape scale, the complete loss of vegetation appears to be a dramatic disturbance that would presumably translate into similarly large shifts in the sediment microbial communities. We previously showed that sites at Hammonasset experiencing SVD supported significantly lower populations of bacteria within the phylum <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroidetes</italic> and an elevated relative abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>). Yet, in this study no OTUs were identified as significantly different in relative abundance. The lack of significant differences could be due to the relatively low replication per individual sample date and site, the depth of sequencing, or the added variability of identifying differences between samples collected on different dates. It is important to note, that while this study did not identify any OTUs significantly altered in abundance due to SVD, that does not indicate that there was no effect on the sediment communities. For example, CAP analysis identified a significant difference in the clustering of samples under different vegetation statuses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-4" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), the taxonomic makeup of the sediment communities at the phylum level was more heterogeneous in the SVD samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-5" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), and there was a clear trend in OTUs that were enriched in the vegetated sites (edge and healthy) compared to SVD sites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-5" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). These data indicate that to the extent that there are shifts in the microbial communities due to SVD, they are likely limited to relatively rare community members and do not involve large shifts in relative abundance. The practical relevance of these observations is that the sediment microbial communities are also likely to respond well to any restoration efforts. For example, we previously demonstrated that SVD-affected sediments are capable of maintaining <italic toggle="yes">S. alterniflora</italic> germination and growth in greenhouse experiments (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>). In this respect, we propose that restoration efforts for SVD-affected sites should primarily focus on the plant communities, as any alterations in the sediment microbial communities do not appear to have any deleterious effects on plant health.</p><p hwp:id="p-31">A multitude of studies have similarly found that disturbance can lead to relatively small shifts in community composition of salt marsh sediment communities. For instance, increasing nitrogen loading to wetland sediments caused decreases in the metabolically active microbial populations without a concurrent alteration in the total community composition (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref>) or may be generally limited to specific nitrogen cycling populations (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>). Even reciprocal transplants between salt marshes resulted in negligible changes in sediment microbial communities (<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref>). A metagenomic survey of two tidal creeks, one of which had received more than 40 years of sewage effluent from its headwaters, found little difference in the taxonomic profile of sediment communities but significant differences in the abundance of nitrogen cycling genes, suggesting shifts in the functional potential of the community without concurrent shifts in community membership (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>). In this regard, sediment microbial communities have proven themselves to be resilient to disturbance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-13"><title hwp:id="title-14">Conclusion</title><p hwp:id="p-32">Microbial communities are responsible for many of the ecosystem functions of coastal wetlands, particularly those for carbon sequestration and storage. Thus, characterizing the resiliency of these communities to disturbance and their natural variation with biogeography and time will be central to modeling their activities, and future in a changing environment. In this study, we show that the sediment microbial communities were relatively unaffected by an ecosystem disturbance, vegetation removal by SVD, at two different wetlands. Furthermore, temporal patterns in the community were small with little change in the composition of the communities between summer and fall. This suggests that the taxonomic makeup of the sediment microbial community was relatively stable in the face of seasonal dynamics and disturbance. These data support that the taxonomic makeup of sediment microbial communities are largely resilient to diverse environmental perturbations and future work may need to focus more specifically on the metabolic activities of the microbial populations.</p></sec><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-14"><title hwp:id="title-15">Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s5a" hwp:id="sec-15"><title hwp:id="title-16">Field sampling</title><p hwp:id="p-33">Sediment samples consisted of <italic toggle="yes">ca.</italic> 5g of material collected with an ethanol-sterilized spatula.
