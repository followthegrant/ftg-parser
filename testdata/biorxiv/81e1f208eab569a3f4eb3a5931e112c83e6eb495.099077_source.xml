To allow precise localization and scale integration between the two disparate imaging modalities, accurate alignment procedures are needed. Here, we describe a marker-free method for aligning images from light or cryo-light fluorescence microscopy and from electron cryo-microscopy that takes advantage of sample support features, namely the holes in the carbon film.

In electron cryo-microscopy, samples are vitrified by fast freezing, resulting in the biological samples being embedded in a layer of amorphous ice, preserved in their native state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Dubochet et al., 1988</xref>). Recent hardware and software developments have revolutionized the field, allowing now to obtain structural information at near atomic resolution of a wide variety of macromolecular assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Subramaniam et al., 2016</xref>) and also enabling imaging of unperturbed cellular landscapes at high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">Asano et al., 2015</xref>). Although some large macromolecular assemblies are identifiable in such cellular reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">Asano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Mahamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Woodward et al., 2015</xref>) the majority of the components are not identifiably without specific labeling, presenting a major challenge in crowded cellular environments.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">The advantages of fluorescence microscopy are complementary to those of electron cryo-microscopy. The fluorescence microscopy approach allows live cell imaging, following specific fluorescently labeled molecules in real time, and the larger field of view facilitates the identification and location of sparse cellular events in a larger context. The combination of the two microscopy approaches potentially allows identifying regions associated with specific biological events by fluorescence microscopy and then investigating the underlying structural features at high resolution by electron cryo-microscopy.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">For correlative imaging, vitrification of the sample can be either performed before or after fluorescence imaging. The advantages of room temperature fluorescence imaging include the use of optimized equipment such as high-powered, oil-immersion lenses with large numerical apertures and that dynamic processes can be characterized and followed. Even if precautions are being made to avoid imaging induced damage caused by buffer and anti oxidative agents, the downside of this procedure is that structures may change in the time required to perform the vitrification. To avoid this problem, cells can be fixed. For carefully chosen fixation protocols, although they might introduce minor artifacts through cross-linking of cellular components, most structural relationships and components are well preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Briegel et al., 2010</xref>). For vitrification before fluorescence imaging, specialized cryo-stages that allow fluorescence imaging at cryo-temperatures are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">Sartori et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Briegel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">Faas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">Hampton et al., 2017</xref>) and the resolution is restricted to about 400 nm or less owing to lack of immersion cryo-objectives. In addition, cryo-fluorescence imaging loses the capability of capturing the dynamics of the biological process. Correlative imaging using super-resolution techniques and electron cryo-microscopy are also under development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Wolff et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-6">For all these correlative techniques, it is necessary to find an accurate alignment between the images from the two imaging modalities. The required coordinate transform generally involves rotation, translation, and scaling. In some instances, when there are significant beam-induced changes to the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Brilot et al., 2012</xref>) or the sample support is tilted in respect to the second imaging modality, further correction may be necessary. In practice, the latter appear to be of minor consequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Schellenberger et al., 2014</xref>). Early applications of correlative fluorescence electron cryo-microscopy imaging took advantage of large cellular features, which allowed a straightforward relative orientation of the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">van Driel et al., 2009</xref>). To increase the accuracy of the alignment and to allow determination of accuracy estimates, the use of fluorescence beads as fiducial markers for alignment was introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Schorb and Briggs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Schellenberger et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we propose a marker-free approach using features of the sample support to provide alignment between images from fluorescence or cryo-fluorescence microscopy and electron cryo-microscopy images. The alignment quality of this approach is with 50-100 nm estimated accuracy comparable to that previously reported for marker-based alignment and does not involve modification of the experimental procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">Sample preparation</title><p hwp:id="p-7">GFP-transfected mouse embryonic fibroblast and Chinese hamster ovary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">Bachir et al., 2014</xref>) were cultured on electron microscopy grids as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> samples were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">Durand et al., 2015</xref>).

Fluorescence modalities used for correlated imaging included FRET, TIRF, confocal, and cryo-fluorescence imaging with mCherry or GFP. Cryo-fluorescence imaging was performed using a CorrSight CLEM microscope (FEI Company), equipped with a motorized stage, a broad-band Xenon light source and motorized fluorescent filter sets.

The approach is based on the visibility of holes in the carbon support in both imaging modalities. The holes are readily identifiable in the electron cryo-microscopy images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) but in the fluorescence images the holes are not immediately apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, there is always a subtle difference between the background fluorescence in the holes versus fluorescence on the carbon that becomes visible when increasing the contrast to maximum. The resulting images tend to be rather noisy, which makes accurate detection of the hole boundaries difficult. Application of several rounds (3-8) of iterative median filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">van der Heide et al., 2007</xref>) improves the situation considerably and most holes become identifiable in the fluorescence images as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-3" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The electron cryo-microscopy images also benefit from a few rounds of iterative median filtering, which suppresses the background variations, especially inside the holes. A combination of edge detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">Canny, 1986</xref>) and circular Hough transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">Kimme et al., 1975</xref>) to the enhanced images allows accurate determination of the hole sizes and boundaries, and thus their center coordinates, in both imaging modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>, red circles).

First, no additional material needs to be added to the sample. Markers need to be explicitly introduced and may obscure features of interest. In contrast, the sample support is always present. Second, the distribution of the holes is regular and covers the entire grid in predictable ways with excellent coverage. Marker concentrations need to be optimized. Too many markers can interfere with the analysis of the sample; too few markers may not be enough for high-quality alignment. In addition, markers can spatially cluster, which can also degrade alignment quality. For example, if ten markers form a small cluster in the lower right-hand corner, then alignment between features in the top left-hand corner may be off significantly even though the precision estimate using the ten marker coordinates will not give any indication of the issue. Third, the large size of the holes makes them amenable for aligning over a larger range of magnifications than point-like fiducial markers such as fluorescent beads can provide.</p><p hwp:id="p-19">The estimated alignment accuracy of our method is with 50-100 nm comparable to accuracy estimates previously provided for marker-based alignment of fluorescence and electron cryo-microscopy images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Schellenberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Schorb and Briggs, 2014</xref>). For bead-based alignment, it is assumed that the bead is essentially a point-like object at the light-microscopy level and a two-dimensional Gaussian is fitted to get a precise, sub-pixel estimate of the center position of the bead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Schellenberger et al., 2014</xref>). When using holes for alignment, a circle must be fitted to the rim of the hole to determine the precise center position. On one hand, this can be an advantage because more image pixels are available for fitting the circle than are normally available for fitting a two-dimensional Gaussian to a bead position. On the other hand, because of the relatively large size of the circles, small errors in center estimates might not be as apparent as an offset Gaussian would be. The cumulative effect does not appear to make a significant difference because the overall alignment accuracy of bead-based and hole-based alignments is comparable.</p><p hwp:id="p-20">The use of the holes in the carbon film of the electron cryo-microscopy sample support for alignment is a viable alternative to bead-based alignment techniques in terms of alignment accuracy and does not require any modification of the sample and is thus less invasive than bead-based methods. The regular and predictable distribution of holes ensures adequate coverage of reference points for alignment in any given area on the grid and the regularity will also help to detect and correct for distortions and relative tilt of the sample support between imaging modalities.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-15">Acknowledgements</title><p hwp:id="p-21">This work was supported by NIGMS grant R01 GM115972 and CCSG Pilot Project funding (P30 CA030199).
