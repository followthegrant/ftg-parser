High-quality benchmark small variant calls for the pilot National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Reference Material (NA12878) have recently been developed by the Genome in a Bottle Consortium, but no similar high-quality benchmark SV calls exist for this genome. Since SV callers output highly discordant results, we developed methods to combine multiple forms of evidence from multiple sequencing technologies to classify candidate SVs into likely true or false positives. Our method (svclassify) calculates annotations from one or more aligned bam files from any high-throughput sequencing technology, and then builds a one-class model using these annotations to classify candidate SVs as likely true or false positives. We first used pedigree analysis to develop a set of high-confidence breakpoint-resolved large deletions. We then used svclassify to cluster and classify these deletions as well as a set of high-confidence deletions from the 1000 Genomes Project and a set of breakpoint-resolved complex insertions from Spiral Genetics. We find that likely SVs generally cluster separately from likely non-SVs based on our annotations, and that the SVs cluster into different types of deletions. We then developed a supervised one-class classification method that uses a training set of random non-SV regions to determine whether candidate SVs have abnormal annotations different from most of the genome. To test this classification method, we use our pedigree-based breakpoint-resolved SVs, 1000 Genomes Project validated SVs validated by the 1000 Genomes Project, and assembly-based breakpoint-resolved insertions, along with semi-automated visualization using svviz. We find that candidate SVs with high scores are generally true SVs, and candidate SVs with low scores are questionable. We distribute a set of 2676 high-confidence deletions and 68 high-confidence insertions with high svclassify scores from these call sets for benchmarking SV callers.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="43"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

SVs include variations such as novel sequence insertions, deletions, inversions, mobile-element insertions, tandem duplications, interspersed duplications and translocations. In general, SVs include deletions and insertions larger than 50 base pairs (bps), while smaller insertions or deletions are referred to as indels, though the threshold of 50 bps is somewhat arbitrary and based on the fact that different bioinformatics methods are usually used to detect SVs vs. small indels and SNPs. SVs have long been implicated in phenotypic diversity and human diseases [<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>]; however, identifying all SVs in a whole genome with high-confidence has proven elusive. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have facilitated the analysis of SVs in unprecedented detail, but these methods tend to give highly non-overlapping results [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. In this work, we develop methods to evaluate candidate SVs based on evidence from multiple NGS technologies.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">NGS offers unprecedented capacity to detect many types of SVs on a genome-wide scale. Many bioinformatics algorithms are available for detecting SVs using NGS including depth of coverage (DOC), paired-end mapping (PEM), split-read and assembly-based methods [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. DOC approaches identify regions with abnormally high or low coverage as potential copy number variants. Hence, DOC methods are limited to detecting only deletions and duplications but not other types of SVs, and they have more power to detect larger events and deletions. PEM methods evaluate the span and orientation of paired-end reads. Read pairs map farther apart around deletions and closer around insertions, and orientation inconsistencies indicate potential inversions or tandem duplications. Split reads are used to identify SVs by identifying reads whose alignments to the reference genome are split in two parts and contain the SV breakpoint. Assembly-based methods first perform a <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> assembly, and then the assembled genome is compared to the reference genome to identify all types of SVs. By combining various approaches to detect SVs, it is possible to overcome the limitations of individual approaches in terms of the types and sizes of SVs that they are able to detect, but still difficult to determine which are true [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>, <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-6">Numerous methods have been developed to find candidate SVs using NGS, but clinical adoption of human genome sequencing requires methods with known accuracy. The Genome in a Bottle Consortium (GIAB) is developing well-characterized whole-genome reference materials for assessing variant-call accuracy and understanding biases. Recently GIAB released high-confidence SNP, indel, and homozygous reference genotypes for Coriell DNA sample NA12878, which is also candidate National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Reference Material 8398 [<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>]. In this work, we developed methods to integrate evidence of SVs in mapped sequencing reads from multiple sequencing technologies. We used unsupervised machine learning to determine the characteristics of the different SV types, and we used One Class Classification to classify candidate SVs as likely true positives, false positives, or ambiguous. Using these methods, we classified three independently established “validated” call sets containing large deletions or insertions.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">Our classification methods use the machine learning technique One Class Classification (OCC) [<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>, <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>]. In contrast to the more common two-class models that have two training sets (e.g., positives and negatives), one-class methods have only a single training set and try to identify sites unlike the training set. In our OCC methods, the algorithm tries to identify a region, R, of the annotation space that contains a specified, large proportion (e.g. 95% or 99%) of the non-SVs. Sites that have annotations falling outside R are classified as SVs. In essence, these are outliers relative to the non-SVs. For selecting R, only a representative set of non-SVs is required for the training. In our model, we use random genomic coordinates as our one class because random coordinates are unlikely to be near true SV breakpoints. For our one-class model, we only include annotations that are likely to indicate a SV if they differ from random coordinates for a defined set of parameters (e.g., read clipping, pair distance, and coverage). We do not include annotations like mapping quality that may not always distinguish SVs from non-SVs because atypical values may also indicate random regions of the genome that are difficult to sequence. We do not use a two class machine learning model because our potential training SV call sets are primarily easier-to-detect mid-size deletions and insertions and are not representative of all types of deletions, insertions, or other SV types, which is an important assumption of two-class models. Therefore, a two class model trying to differentiate our SV sets from random genomic coordinates can do a very good job separating these two sets, but the model is likely to misclassify other candidate SVs not in the “Validated/assembled” call sets (e.g., duplications, deletions in difficult parts of the genome, etc.). Because our one-class model does not rely on biased “Validated/assembled” call sets, we expect our one-class model to be more generalizable to other types of SVs by selecting annotations for which atypical values are usually associated with SVs. Our methods, which classify based on evidence from multiple technologies, are complementary to the recently published Parliament method [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>], which generates candidate SVs using multiple technologies and bioinformatics methods, and then uses a PacBio/Illumina hybrid assembly to determine whether the candidate SVs are likely to be true. Similarly, in the characterization of the performance of the LUMPY tool, the authors developed a high-confidence set that had breakpoints supported by long reads from PacBio or Moleculo. In addition to using svviz to visualize and determine the number of reads supporting the alternate, we also combine the support from multiple sequencing technologies in a robust machine learning model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">Data sets</title><p hwp:id="p-8">Four whole-genome sequencing data sets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-1-1" hwp:rel-id="T1">Table 1</xref>) were used to develop methods to classify candidate SVs into true positives and false positives for Coriell DNA sample NA12878.

Sequencing errors were corrected by counting k-mers. Low count k-mers were discarded as erroneous. The set of high scoring, or true k-mers was used to construct a de Bruijn graph representing an error-free reconstruction of the true read sequences. Each read was corrected by finding the globally optimum base substitution(s) so that it aligned to the graph with no mismatches and differed by the smallest base quality score from the original read. Of these corrected reads, those that did not match the reference exactly were assembled into a discontiguous read overlap graph to capture sequence variation from the reference. Variants were mapped to human reference coordinates (NCBI build 37) by walking the read overlap graph in both directions until an “anchor” read, where a continuous 65 bps matches the reference, denoted the beginning and end of each variant. Where a variant had more than one anchor, pairing information was used to determine the correct location of the anchor. We used 70 calls from the “Insertions” output, all of which were complex insertions (i.e., a set of reference bases was replaced by a larger number of bases).</p></list-item></list></p><table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float" hwp:id="T2" hwp:rev-id="xref-table-wrap-2-1 xref-table-wrap-2-2 xref-table-wrap-2-3 xref-table-wrap-2-4 xref-table-wrap-2-5"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;019372v1/TBL2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">T2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">tbl2</object-id><label>Table 2:</label><caption hwp:id="caption-2"><p hwp:id="p-23">Description of SV validated/assembled sets from Coriell DNA sample NA12878.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="019372_tbl2" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-2"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2c" hwp:id="sec-5"><title hwp:id="title-6">Deduplicated deletions</title><p hwp:id="p-24">Any overlapping deletions within the validated/assembled SV sets were discarded, which resulted in 2336 unique Personalis deletion calls and 1825 unique 1000 Genomes deletion calls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-2-2" hwp:rel-id="T2">Table 2</xref>).

BAM files can come from any aligner. The user can specify the size for the flanking regions. svclassify also includes partially mapped reads to the L, LM, M, RM, or R regions for calculations. The insert size is calculated as the end-to-end distance between the reads (length of both reads + distance separating the reads). Because PacBio reads have high insertion and deletion error rates, Del (the mean of deleted bases of the reads) and Ins (the mean of inserted bases of the reads) were normalized by subtracting the mean Del (0.0428) and Ins (0.0948) per read length of 4000 random regions. For exploratory analyses, svclassify generates 85 to 180 annotations for each SV from each dataset, depending on sequencing technology (Supplementary table 2 and 3). For our unsupervised and one class analyses, we used only subsets of these annotations that we expected to give the best results.

The classifier was based on the empirical distribution of L<sub>1</sub> distances of each of the 4000 sites from the mean M for the 4000 sites. For these likely non-SVs, a threshold value t<sub>p</sub> was determined such that a proportion p of the 4000 L<sub>1</sub> distances were less than or equal to t<sub>p</sub>. The region R is then defined as the set of all points in the transformed data space whose L<sub>1</sub> distance from the mean M is less than or equal to t<sub>p</sub>. When there are only two annotations measured for each site, this region takes the shape of a rhombus. In the high dimensional data space the shape of the region R is a multidimensional rhombus. The classification rule is as follows. Given any new site, calculate its L<sub>1</sub> distance from M. If it is greater than t<sub>p</sub> classify it as a SV. Otherwise call it a non-SV.

Clusters 4 and 5 contain close to 99 % non-SVs, but Cluster 4 generally contains larger sites than Cluster 5. Cluster 8 is a mix of 60 % non-SVs and 40 % SVs, and sites in Cluster 8 generally have a coverage between the normal coverage and half the normal coverage, and more sites have lower mapping quality, repetitive sequence, and high or low GC content. Further subdivisions of Cluster 8 might divide the true SVs from non-SVs.</p><p hwp:id="p-51">98.5 % of sites in Clusters 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 are from the Personalis and 1000 Genomes Gold sets, but the clusters contain different types of SVs. Clusters 1, 2, 3, and 6 generally contain reads with lower mapping quality inside the SV, though the low mapping quality could arise from a variety of sources (e.g., repetitive regions that are falsely called SVs, true heterozygous or homozygous deletions of repetitive elements like Alu elements, or true homozygous deletions that contain some incorrectly mapped reads inside the deletion). Clusters 2 and 3 appear to be true deletions of Alu elements, since sites in these clusters are ∼300 bps, are annotated as SINEs, LINEs, or LTRs by RepeatMasker, have high GC content, and have low mapping quality. Cluster 2 sites are primarily heterozygous Alu deletions since they have about half the typical coverage, and Cluster 3 sites are primarily homozygous Alu deletions and a small fraction of other homozygous deletions because they contain less than half the typical coverage. All 655 sites in Cluster 1 are from Personalis and 1000 Genomes, and appear to be mostly larger homozygous deletions (half are larger than 2000 bps), and they have lower than half the normal coverage, low mapping quality, and more discordantly mapped reads. 86 % of sites in Cluster 6 are from 1000 Genomes and appear likely to represent mostly true homozygous deletions with imprecise breakpoints that are too narrow, since the left and right flanking regions, in addition to the region inside the putative SV, have low coverage less than half the typical coverage. 97.4 % of sites in Cluster 7 are from Personalis and 1000 Genomes, and they appear to be predominantly heterozygous deletions in relatively easier parts of the genome with high mapping quality.

As shown in Supplementary table 3, we did not use several of the annotations from the unsupervised hierarchical clustering because atypical values for these annotations (e.g., mapping quality or SV size) do not necessarily indicate that an SV exists in this location (see the discussion above about hierarchical clustering for possible reasons for low mapping quality).

In general, Personalis and 1000 Genomes sites with high p values were very likely accurate and mostly homozygous, while sites with lower p appeared to be questionable, small, and/or heterozygous. Most of the Spiral Genetics insertions had very high p, indicating a true SV is likely in the region.</p><p hwp:id="p-61">For Personalis, we inspected 20 randomly selected sites with p &gt; 0.99, and all appeared to be accurate (Supplementary table 9). Only 5 (25 %) of these sites appeared likely to be heterozygous, since homozygous deletions generally are more different from random regions than heterozygous deletions. 4 out of 5 heterozygous sites had 0.99 &lt; p &lt; 0.999, whereas all 15 homozygous deletions had p &gt; 0.999 except for one small 52-bps deletion, and 13 of the homozygous deletions had p &gt; 0.9999. Also, all 10 of the randomly selected Personalis sites with 0.9 &lt; p &lt; 0.99 were likely to be true heterozygous deletions, and none were homozygous (Supplementary table 10). There were only 8 sites with p &lt; 0.9 in the Personalis set (Supplementary table 11), and these were a mixture of likely true but very small deletions and other potential deletions that were difficult to determine whether they were true or artifacts since they were only supported by a small number of reads. Therefore, we do not include these in our final high-confidence set.</p><p hwp:id="p-62">For 1000 Genomes, we similarly inspected 20 randomly selected sites with p &gt; 0.99, and all appeared to be accurate except for one in a low complexity region, which had few supporting reads in svviz. Only 4 (20 %) of the sites with p &gt; 0.99 had p &gt; 0.9999, in contrast to 65 % of the Personalis calls. 3 of the 4 site with p &gt; 0.9999 were likely to be homozygous deletions. One likely true heterozygous deletion had p &gt; 0.999, and the remaining 15 sites with 0.99 &lt; p &lt; 0.999 appeared likely to be true heterozygous deletions except for one in a low complexity region (Supplementary table 12). Also, 7 of the 9 randomly selected 1000 Genomes sites with 0.9 &lt; p &lt; 0.99 were likely to be true heterozygous deletions, and none were homozygous (Supplementary table 13). The other 2 sites contained 17 % and 58 % low complexity sequence and 68 % and 66 % GC content, and they appeared likely to be erroneous calls since no reads aligned to the alternate allele for any technology using svviz (except for a single moleculo read for one of the sites). 8 of the 9 randomly selected 1000 Genomes sites with 0.7 &lt; p &lt; 0.9 were smaller than 100 bps, 7 were likely to be true heterozygous deletions, and none were homozygous (Supplementary table 14). 5 of the 7 randomly selected 1000 Genomes sites with p &lt; 0.7 were smaller than 110 bps and were possibly true heterozygous deletions, and none were homozygous (Supplementary table 15). In general, the 1000 Genomes calls have lower p scores than the Personalis calls because the Personalis calls contain a higher fraction of homozygous deletions, fewer very small deletions, and are all breakpoint-resolved.</p><p hwp:id="p-63">All of the complex insertions from Spiral Genetics had p &gt; 0.97, indicating that they are likely to be true SVs. Upon manual inspection of the svviz results (Supplementary table 16), 29 had evidence in all 4 technologies for a homozygous insertion, 29 had evidence in all 4 technologies for a heterozygous insertion, and 8 were inconsistent in terms of zygosity across the 4 technologies. The reason for the discordance between technologies for the 8 discordant sites is not always clear, but it appears that some are likely to be real SVs with different breakpoints. For example, an insertion is called at 1:3,418,563 with a length of 352 bp, but appeared likely to be a large.</p><p hwp:id="p-64">Most candidate sites with p &gt; 0.9 appear to be true, but a few of the manually inspected sites appeared to be inaccurate or to have incorrect breakpoints. Therefore, we further refined our final callset by using svviz to map reads to the reference or predicted alternate alleles, and we included only sites with at least 3 reads supporting the alternate allele in at least 3 of the 4 datasets. This filtered 13 % percent of the calls, leaving 2676 deletions and 68 insertions for which we have high confidence.

To establish high-confidence, methods are needed to combine multiple types of information from multiple sequencing technologies to form robust high-confidence SV and non-SV calls. Therefore, in this work we developed methods to classify SVs as high-confidence based on annotations calculated for multiple datasets. Our classification method gives the highest scores to SVs that are insertions or large homozygous deletions, and have accurate breakpoints. Deletions smaller than 100-bps often have low scores with our method, so other methods like svviz are likely to give better results for very small SVs. Homozygous deletions generally receive the highest scores because they have annotations most unlike random regions of the genome. Breakpoint-resolved deletions generally receive higher scores because reads near the breakpoint have distinct characteristics such as clipping and insert size that our method uses to classify SVs. We produce a set of 2676 high-confidence deletions and 68 high-confidence insertions with evidence from 3 or more sequencing data sets. These sets of SVs are likely biased towards easier regions of the genome and do not contain more difficult types of SVs. However, they can be used as an initial benchmark for sensitivity for deletions and insertions in easier regions of the genome.</p><p hwp:id="p-66">Our unsupervised clustering methods also show promise for classifying candidate SVs into different types and potentially classifying more difficult types of SVs. Seven of the eight clusters obtained from an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis using L<sub>1</sub> distances were relatively <italic toggle="yes">pure</italic> clusters consisting of either mostly SVs or mostly non-SVs. The overall successful separation of the SVs from the non-SVs by the unsupervised analysis suggests that the annotations for SVs and non-SVs occupy more or less disjoint regions in the data space. Since each cluster contains a different type of SV or non-SV, future work might include further investigation of these clusters and sub-clusters to understand their meaning. In addition, we plan to apply these clustering methods to additional types of SVs and develop more sophisticated classification methods that would place new candidate SVs in one of these categories of different types of true or false positive SVs.</p><p hwp:id="p-67">We plan for the methods developed in this work to form a basis for developing high-confidence SV and non-SV calls for the well-characterized NIST RMs being developed by the GIAB. In this work, we apply these methods to produce a set of high-confidence deletions and insertions with evidence from multiple sequencing datasets, and we plan to continue to develop these methods to be applied to more difficult types of SVs in more difficult regions of the genome. We also plan to incorporate calls from methods merging multiple callers, such as MetaSV [<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>], and incorporate statistics from other tools, such as Parliament [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>] and svviz [<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>], in our machine learning models.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-24">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p hwp:id="p-68">The authors would like to thank Niranjan Shekar from Spiral Genetics for contributing the insertion calls used in this manuscript, and Hugo Lam, Jian Li, and Marghoob Mohiyuddin from Bina Technologies for compiling the validated calls from 1000 Genomes.

Therefore outliers indicating potential SVs approach 0 in this transform, which is required by the application of one-class SVM. In the transformed metric space, linear classifiers were trained by the one-class SVM (implemented with package e1071 in the Comprehensive R Archive Network) with SVs from the random regions as the training set. The proportion of SVs in the training set identified as outliers (false positive rate) 1-<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> was approximately controlled by a factor <italic toggle="yes">ν</italic> in the training algorithm defined by the authors. In short, <italic toggle="yes">ν</italic> ∈ (0,1) defines the ratio of penalty induced by margin size (e.g. distance from origin point to the class boundary with linear kernel) and penalty induced by number of outliers in the training set in the total penalty function for soft margin case. Higher ? allows more training data points to be on the outliers side to maximize the margin. Classifiers at different <italic toggle="yes">ν</italic>’s were then applied to predict other SV data sets.</p><fig id="figS1" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F6" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-6-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;019372v1/FIGS1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F6</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">figS1</object-id><label>Supplementary figure 1:</label><caption hwp:id="caption-10"><p hwp:id="p-70">ROC curves for One-class classification using SVM, treating the 4000 Random regions as negatives and the Personalis or 1000 Genomes calls as positives.
