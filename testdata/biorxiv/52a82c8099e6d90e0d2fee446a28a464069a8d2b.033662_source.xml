In episodic sampling, decisions are guided by a few episodic memories of past choices. This process can yield choice patterns similar to model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL); however, samples can vary from trial to trial, causing decisions to vary. Here, we show that context retrieved during episodic sampling can cause choice behavior to deviate sharply from the predictions of RL. Specifically, we show that, when a given memory is sampled, choices (in the present) are influenced by the properties of other decisions made in the same context as the sampled event. This effect is mediated by fMRI measures of context retrieval on each trial, suggesting a mechanism whereby cues trigger retrieval of context, which then triggers retrieval of other decisions from that context. This result establishes a new avenue by which experience can guide choice, and as such has broad implications for the study of decisions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="30"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

According to the dominant model-free reinforcement learning (RL) theory of choice, actions are selected based on expected values that are computed as running averages of experienced rewards. This average is updated incrementally as new rewards are incorporated, resulting in a steadily decaying influence of past experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>]. We have previously shown that this pattern of dependence on experience can also result from an active deliberation process that draws, in a recency-weighted fashion, on episodic memories of relevant past choices as samples of possible outcome values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. For instance, we might evaluate a restaurant by recalling recent dining experiences at similar establishments.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">Both approaches assume that the influence of a past event on choice is a simple function of how long ago that event was experienced or remembered. Where they differ is in how that influence arises. In RL, the contribution of a given past trial to reward estimates on a given choice is a fixed, decreasing function of its age. In episodic sampling this influence is dynamic, which can cause its choices to diverge from RL. Because the process draws only a small number of samples, a given episode (even sometimes one from the far past) will, when recalled, have a large contribution to the estimated value for that decision. At the same time, recent episodes could be overlooked, and thus have no influence on the current choice. This distinction can be obscured when looking at average choice behavior in the sort of repeated decision task usually employed in the laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>]. The difference between the predictions of these two models is more pronounced when incidental reminders of past choices are introduced to the decision-making task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. These reminders cue the past trial episode, recalling the action taken and reward received, and thus affect the next decision in a way not captured by standard RL.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">However, episodic memories consist of more than just the simple association between action and outcome. They also carry rich information about the temporal, spatial, and visual <italic toggle="yes">context</italic> of an experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>]. When context is reinstated, it affects what we remember next: after recalling one event, we are more likely to subsequently recall events that share context with the first [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>]. For instance, when recalling one restaurant, we might also recall the street it was on, which could lead to recalling another restaurant from the same street.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">In this way, retrieval of contextual information could impact decisions made by episodic sampling. Specifically, context could induce a form of autocorrelation in sampling: The first sample also brings to mind the context from which subsequent samples are likely to be drawn. These following samples would also have an impact on decisions. The average influence on choice of a past episode would therefore be a function both of its age and the probability that other, contextually-related episodes would bring it to mind. This extra influence of context (if present) would constitute a radical departure from incremental RL, which has no means of accounting for this influence.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">To probe whether, and by what mechanism, context biases episodic sampling, we designed an experiment to isolate the effects of retrieved context on decision-making, distinct from the effect of the initial sampled trial. Participants performed a three-option choice task in which trials took place across seven visually-distinct contexts, described as âroomsâ of a virtual casino, each distinguished by a context-specific image of an outdoor scene. After making each choice, participants were shown both the reward they earned and a trial-unique object picture. Some of these objects were later presented during recognition memory probes that were interleaved with the choice trials. Importantly, we designed the experiment such that the rewarded choice associated with a probed object was different from the choice that was most frequently rewarded in the room (context) where the probed object was originally presented. This procedure allowed us to disentangle the influence of the reminded trial episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>] from that of the context.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">We hypothesized that, if recall of the reminded trial also triggered the reinstatement of context, we would observe that choices are influenced by the action rewarded in the context as a whole, not just the action rewarded on the reminded trial itself. This hypothesis further implies that the effects of retrieved context on choice will only be evident on trials where the objectâs context (room) is retrieved. To test this prediction, we carried out an fMRI experiment and employed multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to covertly measure neural evidence for context reinstatement on each trial. Pattern classifiers (trained to recognize scene-related activity) output a trial-by-trial measure of how likely it was that participants were recalling a past context. We used this neural reinstatement index as a mediating variable to predict the effect of context on choices.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Experiment 1 provided a behavioral test of influence of context. Experiment 2 provided both a behavioral test and a neural test (using fMRI) of the predictions outlined above. Taken together, these experiments reveal new aspects of the computational and neural mechanisms by which individual episodes of past experience are brought to bear on decisions for reward, and introduce a novel signature of decisions guided by episodic memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">Results</title><p hwp:id="p-10">In Experiment 1, 20 participants performed the task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and their behavior was analyzed for evidence of contextâs influence on decisions.

In <italic toggle="yes">Phase 2</italic>, participants visited a seventh room, where no scene images were visible, and made 120 further choices; 60 recognition memory probes were interspersed between these choices at pseudorandom intervals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-5" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). On recognition probes, participants were asked whether, and with what confidence, they recognized the presented picture. Participants were rewarded with $0.25 for correct responses, and penalized by the same amount for incorrect responses. The average lag between initially viewing a picture and being tested on recognition of that picture was over 170 trials (Expt 1: Average lag 173.40 trials SEM 1.70; Expt 2: 175.88 SEM 0.64). In <italic toggle="yes">Phase 3</italic>, participants were given a source recognition test that assessed whether they could remember the room (context) in which the probed objects were encountered during Phase 1.

Trials with incorrect or low-confidence answers were excluded from further analysis because they were not of interest for our hypothesis; our goal was to evaluate the effect of <italic toggle="yes">successful</italic> reminders on subsequent decisions, and low-confidence and/or incorrect responses indicated that the reminders were unsuccessful. Performance on the Phase 3 source recognition task was also well above chance (Experiment 1 presented all six options, so chance level was 16.67%: actual performance mean 45.80% SEM 5.38% correct; Experiment 2 subselected three options to fit the MRI button box, so chance level was 33.33%: actual performance mean 68.12% SEM 2.38% correct).</p></sec><sec id="s2b" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-6">Experiment 1</title><p hwp:id="p-14">Our primary measurement of interest was performance on choice trials after the recognition memory probes.

First, replicating our previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>], we found that the reward content of trials evoked by memory probes influenced the option selected by participants on the ensuing choice trial.

In this version, participants underwent fMRI scanning to allow us to identify brain activity predictive of the context reward effect.

However, diverging from the results observed in Experiment 1 and the preceding study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>], the reward received on the probed trial did not have a significant effect on subsequent choice (<italic toggle="yes">t</italic>(31)=â0.4878, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=0.6291). Post-hoc simulations confirmed that both the relative prominence of the reminded context effect over the reminded trial effect and the sparing of the context effect when the single trial effect is not statistically reliable are consistent with our context-aware sampling mechanism. The intuition here is that â while the probe initially triggers sampling of the reminded trial â subsequent samples taken from the reminded context will outweigh the effects of sampling the reminded trial (Figures S3 and S4).</p><sec id="s2c1" hwp:id="sec-6"><title hwp:id="title-9">Regression results are incompatible with incremental learning models</title><p hwp:id="p-20">For the analyses reported above, we designed our context reward regressor to capture the average effect of sampling memories from the probed context: For a given context, each episode in that context in which a given card deck was chosen was treated as evidence for or against choosing that card deck (depending or whether the choice was rewarded). This way of computing context reward is qualitatively different from that which would be predicted by an incremental learning algorithm such as model-free temporal-difference learning. This is because those incremental algorithms would more heavily weight later experiences, and those with higher reward prediction errors. However, in our formulation, every trial from the probed context has equal weight.</p><p hwp:id="p-21">To explore whether the observed context reward effect could be explained by incrementally-learned action values, as in model-free reinforcement learning, we first fit RL models to choices in each of the six context rooms.

This produced a real number, between zero and one, reflecting the relative strength of evidence for reinstatement of each context room. Then, we computed the context reward regressor again for all six contexts, and multiplied these values by the corresponding specific-scene evidence, resulting in a distribution of context reward values scaled by the reinstatement evidence for each context. Finally, the sum of these scaled values was entered into the regression as a reinstatement-weighted version of the original context reward regressor.</p><p hwp:id="p-31">Consistent with the idea that the specific content of reinstatements was a strong influence on choices, the regression weight assigned to the evidence-scaled context reward regressor (<italic toggle="yes">Î²<sub>RCR</sub></italic>) was reliably positive (mean=0.3851, SEM 0.0863, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>(31)=4.4611, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>=9.9968eâ05).

Events do not happen in isolation â the memories of our lived experiences are necessarily situated within a web of associations with internal and external state: where they happened, who they happened with, and what else happened in relation. Items can cue retrieval of contextual features and vice-versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>]. When we bring our memories of the past to bear in deciding what actions to take in the present, it stands to reason that this rich contextual web would affect which memories are recalled and â through this â what decisions we make. However, previous work â even work investigating the use of episodic memory in decisions â has not examined the impact of contextual associations on choice.</p><p hwp:id="p-34">In this study, we investigated how memory for the context of past choice outcomes can affect present decisions for reward. We observed that decisions were biased by incidental memory probes that reminded participants of past choice trials. We observed a separate influence of both reward information on the reminded trial, and of reward information on other trials that shared context with the reminded trial. This influence of reminders is not captured by RL models, and the influence of context in particular is a novel prediction of episodic sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-7" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>], tested here for the first time. Across studies, the effect of the reminded context on choices was consistently greater than that of the individual reminded trial. This relationship matches our proposed sequential sampling model, where successive samples after that of the reminded trial are drawn from a linked context whose reward statistics were designed to run counter to the probed trials (Figure S3). The effect of both the reminded trial and its associated context were reduced in the second experiment. However, as predicted by the episodic sampling model, the effect of reminded context remained proportionally stronger than the reminded trial, and, critically, a significant influence on choices (Figure S4).</p><p hwp:id="p-35">To investigate the neural mechanism that gives rise to this effect, we used pattern classifiers trained on fMRI data to produce a continuous neural measurement of evidence for whether participants reinstated context from memory. Critically, we showed that this neural measurement predicted the size of the behavioral effect: The extent to which participants bring to mind the context of past episodes was correlated with the influence of context reward on decisions. These results are consistent with computational models of temporal context memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>] â a central prediction of these models is that, when context is reinstated, this leads to to additional memories being recalled from the same context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>]. The present results tie together this effect of context on memory recall, and the neural mechanisms that mediate the effect, with recent findings that support a role for episodic memory recall in deliberative decisions for reward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-8" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-36">The mechanism presented here is distinct from, but complementary to, the mechanism thought to underlie previous observations of episodic memoryâs involvement in decisions via spreading associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>]. In that study, Wimmer &amp; Shohamy showed that pairing rewards with unvalenced images can âspreadâ that reward (during learning) to other unvalenced images that had been associated with the first, and that this second-order reward association can induce a preference for the latter image. Our experiment design has a more complex associative structure that makes this kind of âreward spreading during learningâ account highly unlikely. To get spreading during learning, we would need to posit that â when participants make choices late in the context (e.g., choosing the blue deck and getting rewarded) â they mentally activate objects shown early in the context (e.g., binoculars) and associate those objects to the blue deck getting rewarded. This is implausible because the only route for the binoculars to be activated is via their link to the context image, and the binoculars were just one of tens of items that were linked to this context; this high âfan outâ of associations from the context image makes it unlikely that participants will strongly activate binoculars or any other single previous item from the context. In any case, even if this did happen infrequently, it is highly implausible that it would happen enough to explain our finding that indirect, contextually mediated associations exert a <italic toggle="yes">stronger</italic> effect on subsequent choice than direct associations. Throughout the paper, we have argued that â rather than âspreadingâ of associations between stimuli and reward during learning â our results arise from dynamic estimation of that value at the time of choice, based on contextually-mediated sampling. The distinction between these two types of memory-guided decisions reflects the proposed division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>] between âretrospectiveâ (referring to the Wimmer &amp; Shohamy finding) versus âprospectiveâ (this study, also Bornstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-9" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]) integration. We provide here the first demonstration that such prospective integration is mediated by context-guided sampling from episodic memory, and that this context information induces sequential dependencies in the integration process. This case for prospective, dynamic estimation of value through sampling is convergently supported by our regression modeling (showing that indirect, contextually-mediated effects are larger than direct effects, and that these effects cannot be explained by incremental learning), simulation work (showing that our context-guided sampling model can account for context effects exceeding direct effects; Figures S3 and S4), and neural data (showing that variance in retrieval of specific scene contexts at the time of choice predicts how strongly context memory affects decision behavior).</p><p hwp:id="p-37">A key contribution of the present work is that it sharply distinguishes the pattern of choices arising from episodic sampling from those predicted by model-free RL. Our previous work assumed only that episodic memories were drawn according to their recency, yielding a dependence of decisions on past experience that follows the same qualitative form as that of incremental RL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-10" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. If that recency-dependent sampling was the only way that episodic memories translated to decisions, then it could be argued that model-free RL fits to behavior capture an approximate, average form of the underlying mechanism. However, the discovery that samples depend in part on context undermines the generalizability of that analogy, because context can induce sequential dependencies into the sampling process that are not explainable in terms of simple recency. Our results suggest that, to estimate the influence that a given past trial will have on the current decision, we must know not only its age, but also the relative likelihood that it might be brought to mind by the recall of other past trials. In this study, the context was made visually explicit, but in natural environments, contextual links between episodes may arise from a wide array of external or internal associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>]; as such, we expect these contextual effects on decision-making to be ubiquitous in everyday life.</p><p hwp:id="p-38">More generally, the present findings pose a challenge for economic approaches to modeling decisions. This is because standard economic models eschew consideration of the underlying mechanism, instead focusing exclusively on inferring stable preferences as ârevealedâ via actual choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>]. Contrary to this view, our results suggest that choices do not always depend solely on stable preferences â instead, they are constructed dynamically at the time of decision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>], and critically via a process that draws on a complex web of contextual associations that might be only incidentally related to past decisions of the same kind. This idea considerably complicates models of decision making, but it also provides a way forward: By drawing on our understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms giving rise to decisions (here, episodic memory retrieval and contextual reinstatement), we account in a principled way for variance in choice behavior that would otherwise be attributed to noise.</p></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-11"><title hwp:id="title-15">Data and code availability</title><p hwp:id="p-39">The data that support the findings of this study are available on reasonable request from the corresponding author (A.M.B).

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects at Princeton University.</p></sec><sec id="s7b" hwp:id="sec-16"><title hwp:id="title-22">Task</title><p hwp:id="p-44">The experiment was controlled by a script written in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA), using the Psychophysics Toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>]. Participants performed a series of 300 choices between three differently-colored card decks with continuously changing probabilities of reward.</p><p hwp:id="p-45">The experiment proceeded in four phases. In <italic toggle="yes">Phase 1</italic>, the <italic toggle="yes">Contexts</italic> phase, 180 choice trials were presented across six consecutive âroomsâ of a virtual casino (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-6" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Rooms were distinguished by the presence of one of six background images of natural scenes. Choices resulted in the top card of the chosen deck being turned over to reveal a trial-unique picture of an everyday object, followed by the presentation of a reward of $10 or $0 (described in detail below, <italic toggle="yes">Choice trials</italic>). The probability that each deck would deliver a $10 reward changed on each trial. This probability was generated according to the procedure described under <italic toggle="yes">Payoffs</italic>. Following Phase 1, participants were asked to rest for as long as they needed, and to indicate their desire to continue by pressing any button twice.</p><p hwp:id="p-46">In <italic toggle="yes">Phase 2</italic>, the <italic toggle="yes">Probes</italic> phase, participants performed 120 additional choice trials, along with 60 memory probe trials interspersed at pseudorandom intervals where we tested recognition memory for objects from Phase 1 (see <italic toggle="yes">Phase 2 recognition probes</italic> below). During this phase, participants were told that they had entered a seventh, âunfinishedâ, room of the casino. In this seventh room, the screen no longer contained a background scene image. Choices in the seventh room did not return object pictures, but continued to be rewarded according to slowly-varying payoff probabilities.</p><p hwp:id="p-47">In <italic toggle="yes">Phase 3</italic>, the <italic toggle="yes">Source Recognition</italic> phase, participants answered 50 source recognition memory questions in which they were asked to match a previously-encountered object image to the scene (context) in which it had appeared (in Experiment 1 the choice was out of all six scenes, while in Experiment 2 the choice was among three presented options to fit the constraints of the MRI button box and for clarity of identification on the projected screen).</p><p hwp:id="p-48">Lastly, in <italic toggle="yes">Phase 4</italic>, the <italic toggle="yes">Localizer</italic> phase, participants performed a blocked, one-back image repeat detection task. This task was used to identify fMRI responses to three image categories: objects, scenes, and scrambled scenes. The detailed timing and structure of trials in each of these four phases are described below.</p><p hwp:id="p-49">Prior to the experiment, participants were given written and verbal instructions as to the types of trials, the payoff probabilities, the button presses required of them, and the rules for determining the final payout. They were told that the decks had different probabilities of paying out, that these probabilities would continually change, and that the probabilities of each deck paying out were independent of each other (as were the outcomes themselves). They were also told that that no aspect of the decks or choice process would change when traveling between rooms â in other words, one could not expect payoff probabilities to shift suddenly when the rooms did â but that the payoff probabilities would occasionally change dramatically, in addition to continuously changing slowly. Instructions emphasized that there was no pattern linking the content of the object pictures to their dollar value or deck. Participants were not told that the Phase 2 memory probe trials should have an effect on their choices, nor was any effect implied. They were, however, told that their final payout would depend in part on their later memory linking the object pictures to the room scenes. To aid their memory, participants practiced, and were encouraged to use, an elaborative encoding strategy in which they would construct, but not vocalize, a sentence describing the object being used in the background scene (e.g. for the object-scene shown pair in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-7" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>, an example sentence might be âI use these binoculars to look at the city skyline.â).

In Phase 1, the background of the screen contained a picture of one of six outdoor scenes. The background scene remained consistent for 30 consecutive trials, then changed at the onset of next âroomâ. Participants were given three seconds to make a choice between the decks. Decks were chosen by pressing the â1â, â2â, or â3â key in Experiment 1, and the buttons under the index, middle, or ring finger in Experiment 2, corresponding to the decks from left to right. When a choice was made, the unchosen decks were hidden and the chosen deck was isolated on the green table, and remained so until the end of the three second choice period. For Phase 1 only, the top card of the chosen deck was âturned overâ to reveal a trial-unique picture of an everyday object. This picture remained on the screen for two seconds, and then the card was turned back over. The isolated deck remained on the screen and a reward value was displayed â either $10 (a picture of a US $10 bill) or $0 (a phase-scrambled version of the same bill). The reward value remained on the screen for 1.5 seconds, followed by a blank screen for an inter-trial-interval (ITI) of length varying between 0.5 and 8 seconds, mean 1 second, selected from a truncated, discretized exponential distribution generated pseudorandomly for each participant. Between rooms, participants were shown a screen with the name of the next room, and a countdown from four seconds before the next room began.</p></sec><sec id="s7b2" hwp:id="sec-18"><title hwp:id="title-24">Payoffs</title><p hwp:id="p-52">For Phase 1 and Phase 2, choices resulted in rewards with amounts selected according to continually changing probabilities.

Because no scenes were on the screen during or after the probes, we treated elevated scene evidence as indicating that participants recollecting contextual information (background scenes) from Phase 1. We compared scene evidence in different conditions and at different time points using paired-sample t-tests; all tests were two-tailed.</p><p hwp:id="p-85">Our final analysis involves splitting probe trials into four bins by the amount of classifier evidence for scenes on our selected timepoints of interest. These bins may have different variance within them, which could potentially confound the subsequent regression analysis we perform using these evidence quantities. Therefore, to evaluate the relative contribution of classifier evidence in different quartiles to explaining the context reward effect, we report standardized regression coefficients (Schroeder et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>]; <xref rid="eqn6" ref-type="disp-formula" hwp:id="xref-disp-formula-6-1" hwp:rel-id="disp-formula-6">Equation 6</xref>) that scale the regression weights by the relative variance of the evidence timeseries in quartile <italic toggle="yes">i</italic> as a proportion of the variance of the context reward in that quartile:

For each participant, and for each context room, we produced a template pattern of PPA activity in that room, by averaging activity in each PPA voxel across all 30 choice trials. We then computed, at each probe trial that evoked a past decision, the average pattern in PPA across our timepoints of interest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-6" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Next, we computed the fisher-transformed correlations between these trial patterns and each template. These values were then entered into the multiple regression analysis, as described in the section Reinstatement-scaled context reward, above.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s8" hwp:id="sec-32"><title hwp:id="title-39">Statistics</title><p hwp:id="p-87">A within-subject design was used. Thus, experimental group randomization or blinding was not applicable. To examine the effect of recent and reminded rewards on choices, and parameters across model fits, we performed a multiple regression separately for each subject, and tested the resulting population of beta weights against zero, using one-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests. We compared beta weights within experiments using paired two-sample <italic toggle="yes">t-</italic>tests. We used unpaired, two-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests to compare beta weights across experiments. All <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-tests were two-tailed, except for the localizer contrast, which used the standard SPM one-sample tests. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested before analysis. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes. Sample size (20) in Experiment 1 was based on a previous experiment using a similar task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-12" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. For Experiment 2, sample size (32) was based on our current standard lab practice for fMRI sample stopping criterion, as well as referenced to the sample size in a previous fMRI study performed in our lab (14) that also used classifier evidence of scenes as a signature of context reinstatement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>], which here was more than doubled to account for the finer degree of distinction required for these analyses. Incremental learning models were compared on the basis of their likelihoods (summed log choice probabilities), using BIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref>] to penalize the third model for its additional parameter.</p></sec><ref-list hwp:id="ref-list-2"><title hwp:id="title-40">Methods-only References</title><ref id="c17" hwp:id="ref-17" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-17-1"><label>[17]</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="033662v5.17" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-17"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Brainard David H."><given-names>David H.</given-names> <surname>Brainard</surname></string-name>. <article-title hwp:id="article-title-16">The Psychophysics Toolbox</article-title>. <source hwp:id="source-17">Spatial Vision</source>, <volume>10</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>433</fpage>â<lpage>6</lpage>, Jan <year>1997</year>.
