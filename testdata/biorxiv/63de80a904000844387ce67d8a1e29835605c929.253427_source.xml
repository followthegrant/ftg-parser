While the performance for current binding site predictors is well characterised, little is known on how these models perform at predicting impact of variants. We collected and curated over 132,000 potential allele-specific binding (ASB) ChIP-seq variants across 101 transcription factors (TFs). We then assessed the accuracy of TF binding models from five different methods on these high-confidence measurements, finding that deep learning methods were best performing yet still have room for improvement. Importantly, machine learning methods were consistently better than the venerable position weight matrix (PWM). Finally, predictions for certain TFs were consistently poor, and our investigation supports efforts to use features beyond sequence, such as methylation, DNA shape, and post-translational modifications.

Differential gene expression can drive and contribute to almost every aspect of disease phenotypes. Understanding the intricate process of TF-DNA binding can, therefore, provide mechanistic hypotheses for variants and propel the discovery of novel therapies. Fortunately, through the aid of high throughput techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequence (ChIP-seq), systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and protein binding microarrays (PBMs), the binding specificities of many TFs have been exhaustively catalogued over the past decade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Genetic variation falling within specificity determinants of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) can alter binding by introducing novel binding sites or diminishing existing binding sites, often resulting in a substantial impact on molecular phenotypes through changes in gene expression. Although experimental approaches have utilised ChIP-seq to map variants to molecular-level traits such as TF-binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref></sup>, these approaches are costly and cannot yet be routinely applied to the sizeable quantity of genetic variation data available. As such, much effort has gone into modelling TF-DNA binding <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic>. The current standard for predicting TFBSs is the position weight matrix, owing to its simplicity and intuitiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>. More recent machine learning, and specifically deep learning methods have been developed that are able to capture far more complex binding motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></sup>. These methods have also been employed to predict variants likely to alter TFBSs and have thus become an essential component of many variant prioritization pipelines, such as the variant effect predictor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">The performance by which TF binding models are able to distinguish their binding regions from random genomic regions has been well characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref></sup>. To assess how well these predictors perform at identifying the impact of variants, known regulatory variants are often employed, which include variants from the Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD), genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup>. Yet, little has been done to explore the ability of these models to assess the impact of genetic variants on binding in a TF-specific manner. Allele-specific ChIP-seq binding (ASB) is a valuable resource to carry out such performance assessments. Here, ChIP-seq reads are mapped to either allele of heterozygous variants within an individual or cell line, allowing for the explicit identification of variants that do and do not alter TF occupancy. Several studies have utilized ASB data to explore TF-specific performance at assessing variant impact. For instance, Zeng et al. used ASB variants for six TFs to validate their GERV method at identifying TFBS-altering variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup>. Shi et al. compiled a dataset of over 10,000 ASB variants across 45 ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets and demonstrated that ASB variants lie within highly relevant PWM positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref></sup>. These studies are, however, often based on a small number of TFs or are focused on individual variant impact methods.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">In this study, we aimed to carry out a systematic and unbiased analysis of the performance of TF-binding models at assessing variant impact. We compiled and collected a compendium of over 132,373 potential ASB variants across 101 TFs. We define ASB variants for 81 of these TFs and compare the performance of five different methods, based on PWMs, deep learning and k-mer-based machine learning, at predicting impactful variants through different measures of variant impact for each method. In some cases, these measures perform differently at variant impact prediction. We show that, overall, deep learning and k-mer-based machine learning methods significantly outperform that of the commonly-used PWMs. We also explore the performance of TFs individually, identifying TFs that are able to accurately predict variant impact as well as those that, although have distinct binding specificities, are unable to do so. We finally investigate mechanisms such as methylation, DNA shape, PTMs and co-binders that may explain poor performance in variant impact prediction. We show that ASB data serves as a valuable benchmarking resource on which the performance of TF binding models can be exhaustively surveyed with respect to variant impact.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">Results</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><label>1.1</label><title hwp:id="title-4">A compendium of allele-specific binding events</title><p hwp:id="p-8">To assess the performance of TF-binding impact predictions, we require a set of variants known to alter binding, whether the alteration is a gain or loss, and also a set of variants known to not alter binding. This is conveniently provided by ASB data. We collected ASB variants from five studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref></sup>, with each study providing heterozygous variants, the sample or cell line from which it was obtained, and reference and alternate allele read counts and the TF affected (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1a</xref></bold>). Since read counts were collected from different sources and processed with their respective analysis pipelines, we also ensured results from different studies were consistent with one another where possible. We correlated the effect sizes of overlapping ASB variants from different studies and found a high degree of concordance (mean Pearson r = 0.79, <bold>Supplementary Figure S1</bold>). In line with this reasoning, if an ASB variant was reported across multiple studies, we retained the entry with highest number of total mapped reads. We additionally discarded variants with fewer than 10 reads mapping to the reference or alternate allele, for a total of 132,373 variants and 215,631 TF-variant pairs (potential ASB events) reported across 101 TFs. The largest fraction of TFs was reported in a single study, with a total of 50 TFs and as few as three TFs were reported across all five studies (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1b</xref></bold>).

Although one would expect that there would be a significantly higher number of losses than gains, since disrupting a binding site is mechanistically easier, our results indicate that overall a random variant has just as much chance of creating a site as it does to destroy one.

Overall, 81 TFs had at least one defined ASB and non-ASB event, whereas 58 TFs had at least 10 events and 51 TFs had at least 20 events.

Strikingly, loss ASB variants consistently demonstrated a higher fraction of rare variants, compared to non-ASB variants (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;1.57×10<sup>−9</sup>), which was in contrast to gain ASB variants that did not show any significant enrichment (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.98, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-4" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1f</xref></bold>).

To do this, we convert raw scores (which are not on any particular scale and not comparable across TFs) to likelihoods of binding (which are normalized to [-1, 1] and are comparable across TFs). We define positive and negative sequences as those used to train the DeepBind or PWM model and random genomic regions, respectively (<bold>Methods</bold>). We found that, particularly for ChIP-seq/SELEX data used to train DeepBind models, distributions of raw scores from the background followed a normal distribution and in some cases, distributions of foreground scores were bimodal with one component of scores exhibiting similar properties to that of the negative distribution (<bold>Supplementary Figure S3</bold>). This is likely due to lenient threshold used to call the ChIP-seq peaks, which was done to maximise the number of sequences available to train models. Since the foreground distribution is bimodal, we use a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to learn the two components comprising the foreground distribution. One component is fixed to the parameters of the negative distribution and the “true positive” component is learned.

This suggests DNA shape as a valuable feature when assessing variant impact on TF-binding.</p><p hwp:id="p-46">Finally, we explore the impact of PTMs on TFs binding.

Since both alleles exist in the same cellular environment, ASB variants serve as a valuable source to assess the performance of TF-binding models at assessing the impact of variants. We have shown that the ability for machine learning models, in particular, deep learning methods, to significantly reduce the number of false positives allows for more accurate variant impact predictions. Deep learning approaches are able to utilise the full extent of ChIP-seq and SELEX data to learn far more complex positional dependencies in binding sites. Deep learning approaches are also not confined to the exact motif location and therefore can model sequence context of the binding site, which has been shown to contribute to binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">43</xref></sup>. We finally show that TFs with poor performance at assessing variant impact often rely on additional mechanisms such as binding partners, methylation, DNA shape and PTMs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-7" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6</xref></bold>).</p><p hwp:id="p-50">Assessing TF-DNA binding and how it is influenced by genetic variation <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> is a much more complex process than once thought. Current methods available for interpreting effects of TFBS variants rely primarily on binding specificity. Although this provides a useful framework for prioritizing non-coding variants, as demonstrated by results, even the most sophisticated methods are often unable to capture the full extent of altered binding in the genome. This can be attributed to several reasons. First, there are several other mechanisms that have been known to significantly contribute to binding specificities such as epigenetic modifications, cooperative binding, geometric shapes of DNA, PTM modifications and more. Epigenetics, in particular, methylation, can play a major role in enhancing or inhibiting TF-binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44" hwp:id="xref-ref-44-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-44">44</xref></sup>. The recent study by Yin et al. carried out methylation-sensitive SELEX in 542 TFs and identified many methylation-dependent TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref></sup>. Epigenetics can also greatly affect regions TFs can occupy. Nucleosome occupancy, for instance, results in closed chromatin which is inaccessible to TFs. Indeed, DNAase hypersensitivity sequencing (DHS-seq) has revealed regions of open chromatin in many cell lines, which have been shown to improve binding prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">45</xref></sup>. PTMs is another major regulator of TF activity through altering its structural conformation, stability or sub-cellular localization thereby affecting binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">40</xref></sup>. For instance, phosphorylation of p53 on S378 allows it be recognized by 14-3-3 proteins, which associate with p53 and significantly enhances DNA-binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46" hwp:id="xref-ref-46-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-46">46</xref></sup>. Second, binding preferences of a TFs have been shown to be heterogeneous across different cell lines. For instance, Arvey et al. comprehensively analysed ChIP-seq data for 67 TFs across multiple different and found that many cell-type-specific sequence models were able to capture binding variability, which was primarily due to differences in heteromeric complex formations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">47</xref></sup>. Since the samples and cell lines from which ASB variants were obtained do not always match that of the experiments used to generate TF-specificity models, this is a potential confounding factor of poor performing models.</p><p hwp:id="p-51">Another factor greatly limiting the prediction of TFBS-altering variants is the availability of TF motifs.
