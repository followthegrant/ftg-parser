Loose cell-attached recording was introduced in 2000 to circumvent this problem since it enabled combined recording and stimulation of visually-identified neurons without necessitating a tight (gigaohm) seal. Since the stimulus voltages required to evoke action potentials through low resistance seals are beyond the capacity of most commercial amplifiers, Barbour and Isope introduced a variation of classic patch clamp amplifier circuit that is able to deliver stimulus voltages that are effective in triggering action potentials under the loose cell-attached patch clamp configuration. The present report presents the design and operation of a simpler amplifier that contains only two integrated circuits and is able to effectively stimulate and record action potentials in mitral cells in rodent olfactory bulb slices. The addition of an accessory analog gating circuit enables manual control of the stimulus voltage with pulse timing controlled by a digital output from a computer. This system may be useful in studies that require surveying many potential pairs of neurons for synaptic connections and for sampling and manipulating single-cell activity in in vivo electrophysiology experiments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Keywords</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">Patch-clamp</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">cell-attached recording</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">brain slice</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">action potential</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-6">paired recordings</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-7">olfactory bulb</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-8">neuronal stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-3">Introduction</title><p hwp:id="p-3">Patch clamp methods have had a major impact in cellular neuroscience and have facili-tated recordings of activity at both single channel (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref></bold>) and whole cell (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></bold>) recording modes.Because of its high sensitivity and low noise, whole-cell recording has proved especially useful in probing synaptic circuits in acute and cultured brain slices. However there are two primary disadvantages associated with intracellular recordings using the whole-cell recording configuration: dialysis of the intracellular contents of the recorded neuron and the requirement to replace the recording pipette after every recording attempt. In 2000, Barbour and Isope (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></bold>) introduced a novel recording configuration for brain slice recording, loose cell-attached recording (LCA), that circumvents both problems and a provides a convenient means for both triggering and recording spiking in individual neurons. This method is a variation of traditional cell-attached recording (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref></bold>) that had been used many groups to monitor neural spiking (e.g., <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></bold>). Loose cell-attached recording was devel-oped originally for recording from muscle cells (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref></bold>). With LCA, the same pipette can be used to record from multiple neurons since the seal resistance required to record spiking is less than needed to detect channel activity. Since there is no whole-cell access with LCA,there is also no intracellular dialysis. The ability to patch multiple neurons using the same pipette is especially useful for locating synaptically-coupled pairs of neurons (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref></bold>).</p><p hwp:id="p-4">One reason why LCA was not commonly used is that the voltages required to trigger APs (typically 100s of mV) are beyond the capacity of most commonly used patch clamp amplifiers. Blindly stimulating at these voltages without recording the neuronal response is not generally a useful strategy since the effective stimulus intensities can damage the neuron. To be useful, it is necessary to know whether the stimulus applied was effective in triggering an action potential (AP) and then employ the smallest stimulus intensities possible. The primary innovation in the Barbour and Isope (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></bold>) study was the introduction of a specialized patch clamp circuit that allowed relatively high voltages to be applied to the membrane patch in the LCA configuration while retaining the ability to detect spiking. With this type of patch clamp amplifier it was often possible to resolve an evoked AP beyond the large stimulus artifact in the recording channel. Even if APs could not be discerned in the on-line recording, evoked spikes could be easily resolved by subtracting the stimulus artifact associated with a failure trial or a just-subthreshold response. The ability to both stimulate and detect APs through LCA recording represented an advance over blindly stimulating through a LCA recording without verification that the stimulus had triggered an AP.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">While the Barbour and Isope circuit was successful at performing LCA recording, it was moderately complex, containing 8 operational amplifiers (op amps) in separate headstage and remote electronic circuits. The design also included additional features, such as bath ground isolation, that add to circuit complexity. In this report we describe a simpler design that contains only a headstage circuit and requires two op amps. We show this simpler circuit is effective in both recording and stimulating APs from mitral cells in acute olfactory bulb slices.

While many high gain tran-simpedance amplifiers include a small capacitor across the feedback resistor to minimize gain peaking, we found that eliminating this extra 1-2 pF capacitance improved our ability to recognize evoked APs even without artifact subtraction.

The longer enclosure also enabled the electrode holders to be located at approximately the same position on the end faces of both the AxoPatch 1D and LCA amplifier headstage boxes, facilitating experiments in which neurons initially recorded using the LCA headstage are subsequently re-patched to establish a whole-cell recording configuration. The headstage box was mounted on a motorized 3-dimensional manipulator (461XYZ, Newport) controlled by custom servo power amplifiers. Custom software enabled a precision computer gaming joystick (Extreme 3D Pro, Logitech) to move the electrode to form the loose patch recording configuration under IR-DIC visu-alization (typically through a Zeiss 63x water objective and imaged with a 0.5 inch CCDcamera onto an analog monochrome monitor). The headstage amplifier was powered by ±15 volt supplies using a regulated linear triple output power supply module (HBAA-40W-A, Power-One). The positive 5 volt output line was not used in the headstage circuit but is required for the accessory analog gating module described below.</p></sec><sec id="s3b" hwp:id="sec-9"><title hwp:id="title-12">Circuit operation</title><p hwp:id="p-14">The headstage circuit can be operated in three different voltage-clamp modes, two of which require only an additional low-pass electronic filter and data acquisition interface to form a complete system.

In practice, using an analog switch and a 10-turn potentiometer to control the stimulus voltage was preferable (<italic toggle="yes">Mode C</italic> in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-6" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). In this mode, a digital output line from the data acquisition interface controlled a single pole, double throw analog switch (HI-5043, Intersil). The output of the analog switch was buffered using a low noise op amp (OP27, Analog Devices) and connected to the headstage input through a coaxial cable. Since the OP27 amplifier is operated in an inverting mode, a negative voltage is applied from the analog switch to generate a positive stimulus at the loose patch. Depending on stimulus voltage required, a fixed resistor can be connected in series with the potentiometer resistor to decrease the sensitivity. Adding a 33 kΩ resistor in series with a 5 kΩ 10-turn potentiometer decreases the sensitivity from 1.5 V/turn to 133 mV/turn with a 15 V supply. This stimulation gain setting for <italic toggle="yes">Mode C</italic> LCA recordings gave satisfactory results with typical experiments requiring 200 500 mV pulses (50 <italic toggle="yes">μ</italic>s duration). While shorter stimulus pulses (25 <italic toggle="yes">μ</italic>s duration) provided better separa-tion between the artifact and evoked AP, the stimulus intensities required to reliably trigger APs were more variable than with slightly longer pulses; 50 <italic toggle="yes">μ</italic>s duration pulses provided a good compromise in our experiments. The TTL output lines on the the data acquisition device used in these experiments (ITC-18, Instrutech/Heka/Harvard Bioscience) were optically isolated. If another, non-isolated data acquisition device is employed optical isolation should be added to the analog switch circuit. The stimulus control circuit was assembled on a generic prototyping printed circuit board and powered by the same triple output linear power supply module as the headstage amplifier.</p><p hwp:id="p-17">In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-2" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2</xref>, the same olfactory bulb mitral cell was simultaneously recorded under whole-cell conditions (with an AxoPatch 1D amplifier) and the custom LCA amplifier operating in <italic toggle="yes">Mode A</italic>.

Dual recording/stimulation LCA experiments used the same conditions as recording-only experiments (saline-filled pipettes). A potential complication when performing artifact subtraction is saturation of the LCA output signal, resulting in distorted artifact responses. While the FLA-01 used to low-pass filter the head-stage output can provide additional gain, we typically used the filter at either the unity gain setting or minimal additional gain (e.g., 2X) to prevent saturation at ± 10 V full-scale ADC input range using with the ITC-18 acquisition device.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="F3" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-3-1 xref-fig-3-2 xref-fig-3-3"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;191718v1/FIG3</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F3</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig3</object-id><label>Figure 3:</label><caption hwp:id="caption-3"><title hwp:id="title-14">Paired recording between olfactory bulb mitral and granule cells</title><p hwp:id="p-18">A, Diagram of recording configuration with a <italic toggle="yes">Mode C</italic> recording from the mitral cell (black traces) and an intracellular (whole-cell current clamp) recording of the granule cell (red trace).

Loose patch stimulation represents a simple method for stimulating one neuron without activating nearby neurons or axons. Loose patch clamp recordings also do not dialyze the intracellular contents of the recorded neuron, providing another advantage over conventional whole-cell recordings. While the relatively large (100s of mV) voltages required to reliably trigger APs is beyond the capacity of most commercial patch clamp amplifiers designed for whole-cell or single-channel recordings, the home-built amplifier we employed uses only two integrated circuits and is inexpensive to construct. The electronic components required for the headstage circuit can be purchased for less than $25 and all the design files required to have printed circuit boards manufactured are available on the GitHub repository. The availability of a simple but workable design for a LCA amplifier that can be used to stimulate APs in individual neurons may be helpful in studies aimed at identifying monosynaptically-coupled neuronal pairs in cell cultures or brain slices. This method could also be applied in vivo to assay the effect circuit and/or behavioral effects of defined manipulations to individual neurons (e.g., <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref></bold>).</p><p hwp:id="p-21">Our circuit design represents an adaptation of a circuit presented in a previous report (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></bold>) and is based on classic patch clamp amplifier designs (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref></bold>). In the previous LCA report (<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></bold>), additional circuitry was employed to transmit both the current signal and command voltage with low noise from a remote electronics box to the headstage circuit. While we did not compare the operation of both circuits, we demonstrate that our simpler design had sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to detect APs in olfactory bulb mitral cells and therefore is likely to be useful in other neurons with large APs such as hippocampal and neocortical pyramidal cells. The present amplifier also did not include circuit elements that were present in the previous Barbour and Isope design that prevented input signal saturation and that isolated the bath ground by passing the reference electrode through a high impedance op amp input. These three non-essential circuit subsystems (paired transmission lines, anti-saturation control and bath ground isolation) accounted for the majority of the components (6/8 op amps) in the previous design. The need for anti-saturation circuitry is reduced in our design because of the lower feedback resistance used in the transimpedance input amplifier (20 MΩinstead of 50 MΩ).</p><p hwp:id="p-22">Searching for monosynaptically-coupled pairs of neurons in brain slices is a common application of patch clamp recording (e.g., <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref></bold>). With whole-cell recordings, glass electrodes typically cannot be re-used after a recording attempt because of the difficulty in achieving a second gigaohm seal once the positive pressure applied to the electrode is released. The inability to re-use patch clamp electrodes represents a significant hurdle during large-scale studies that employ paired recordings since at least one electrode must be removed for every connection tested. The ability to re-use electrodes is one of the primary advantages of LCA recording. With loose patch clamp recording, multiple potential presynaptic neurons can be tested more rapidly while maintaining a conventional whole-cell intracellular recording on the postsynaptic neuron. In our experience using rodent olfactory bulb slices, not having to replace the presynaptic recording electrode after every attempted paired recording attempt increased throughput by approximately 4 times. The primary trade-off with this approach is the inability to visualize the presynaptic neuron without re-patching it to achieve a whole-cell recording configuration. Another trade-off of LCA recordings is the variable threshold voltage required to trigger APs. By periodically monitoring the stimulus voltage required to trigger spikes, we have main-tained monosynaptically-coupled paired recordings for up to 50 minutes (using LCA for the presynaptic neuron and whole-cell recording for the postsynaptic neuron).</p><p hwp:id="p-23">A limitation with loose patch stimulation using the present circuit is that for some experiments, a failure trial needs to be acquired and subtracted from each record to reveal stimulus-evoked APs. In many of recordings, differences in the raw current trace are sufficient to enable the operator to determine if an AP was triggered (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In some ex-periments, off-line artifact subtraction was required to unambiguously determine when stimuli were effective in triggering APs. In principle, artifact subtraction could be automated by using a second analog switch (and a second TTL output) that reverses the pulse stimulus polarity. In this approach, the acquisition software could apply a stimulus pulse with the same amplitude but opposite polarity at the end of each episode, then automatically display the artifact-subtracted current waveform.</p><p hwp:id="p-24">The threshold voltage required to trigger an AP tended to vary throughout most experiments. Since applying large stimulus voltages through the LCA amplifier can degrade the health of the patched neuron, it was helpful to continuously track the threshold stimulus voltage and employ just-suprathreshold intensity stimuli. Even when adjusting the stimulus voltage to be just-suprathreshold, we occasionally triggered spontaneous spiking in the recorded neuron. In most cases, pausing the stimulation for several minutes abolished the spontaneous spiking.</p><p hwp:id="p-25">One possible method to reduce the work required to manually track the threshold stimulus is to apply a weak second voltage pulse to monitor seal resistance. This could be implemented using a second analog switch connected to the same virtual ground summing point on the inverting input to U3. By monitoring seal resistance, one could determine if the change in threshold stimulus voltage required to trigger APs could be predicted by changes in seal resistance. If changes in seal resistance explained the variation in the stimulus voltage required to triggered APs, the acquisition software could provide a continuously updated estimate of the threshold stimulus required. Alternatively, the acquisition software could directly control the stimulus intensity using a digital-to-analog converter or a digital potentiometer.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list hwp:id="ref-list-1"><title hwp:id="title-16">References</title><ref id="c1" hwp:id="ref-1" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-1-1"><label>1.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="191718v1.1" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-1"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Almers W."><surname>Almers</surname>, <given-names>W.</given-names></string-name>, <string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Stanfield P.
