Cancer cell lines are widely-used models to study cancer biology and test drug candidates. However, it is still unknown to what extent they adequately resemble the disease in patients. The recent accumulation of large-scale genomic data in cell lines, mouse models, and patient tissue samples provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the suitability of cell lines for metastatic cancer research. In this work, we used breast cancer as a case study. The comprehensive comparison of the genetic profiles of 57 breast cancer cell lines with those of metastatic breast cancer samples revealed substantial genetic differences. In addition, we identified cell lines that more closely resemble different subtypes of metastatic breast cancer. Surprisingly, a combined analysis of mutation, copy number variation and gene expression data suggested that MDA-MB-231, the most commonly used triple negative cell line for metastatic breast cancer research, had little genomic similarity with Basal-like metastatic breast cancer samples. We further compared cell lines with organoids, a new type of preclinical model which are becoming more popular in recent years. We found that organoids outperformed cell lines in resembling the transcriptome of metastatic breast cancer samples. However, additional differential expression analysis suggested that both types of models could not mimic the effects of tumor microenvironment and meanwhile had their own bias towards modeling specific biological processes. Our work provides a guide of cell line selection in metastasis-related study and sheds light on the potential of organoids in translational research.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="43"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

The differences between cell lines and tumors have raised the critical question to what extent cell lines recapitulate the biology of tumor samples<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>,<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">The emergence of large-scale genomic data provides an unprecedented opportunity to quantify the biological differences between cancer cell lines and human tumors. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project characterized both genetic and transcriptome profiles of more than 10,000 human tumor samples across over 32 tumor types<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup>.

In addition, they identified several rarely used cell lines closely resembled ovarian tumor samples. We examined the transcriptome similarity between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and HCC tumor samples and demonstrated that nearly half of the HCC cell lines did not resemble HCC tumor samples<sup><xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref></sup>.

Previous cell line evaluation analysis was mainly performed in reference to primary tumors. It remains unknown whether cell lines closely resemble metastatic cancer and thus are appropriately used in translational research.

This large-scale genomic profiling combined with existing genomic data allows the evaluation of the suitability of cell lines as models for metastatic cancer.

Whole-exome sequencing was performed for MET500 samples, while hybrid capture sequencing was performed for CCLE cell lines. We thus only focused on the 1,630 genes genotyped in both studies. We were particularly interested in two types of genes that may play important roles in breast cancer metastasis: genes that are highly mutated in metastatic breast cancer, and genes that are differentially mutated between metastatic and primary breast cancers.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Consistent with previous research, we identified a long-tailed mutation spectrum of the 1,630 genes in MET500 breast cancer samples and 69 of them were highly mutated (mutation frequency &gt; 0.05, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-1" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig S1a</xref>). The five most-altered genes were TP53 (0.67), PIK3CA (0.35), TTN (0.29), OBSCN (0.19), and ESR1 (0.14). We identified 19 differentially mutated genes between MET500 and TCGA samples (FDR &lt; 0.001) and the five most significant genes were ESR1, TNK2, OBSN, CAMKK2, and CLK1 (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-2" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig S1b</xref>). Interestingly, all of these 19 differentially mutated genes had higher mutation frequency in MET500 than TCGA, which is consistent with previous study showing that metastatic cancer has increased mutation burden compared to primary cancer<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup>. 68% of them were also among the 69 highly mutated genes mentioned above. After merging the two gene lists, 75 unique genes remained (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig 2a</xref> and Table S1). The median mutation frequency of the 75 genes across CCLE breast cancer cell lines was 0.07 and only 9% of them (PRKDC, MAP3K1, TTN, ADGRG4, TP53, FN1, and AKAP9) were mutated in at least 50% of cell lines, suggesting that majority of these gene mutations could be recapitulated by only a few cell lines. Surprisingly, nine of the 75 genes (ESR1, GNAS, PIKFYVE, FFAR2, RNF213, MYBL2, KAT6A, MAP4K4, and FMO4) were not mutated in any cell line. Notably, ESR1 has been identified as a driver gene of cancer metastasis and associated mutations can cause endocrine resistance of metastatic breast cancer cells<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>,<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref></sup>, yet none of the cell lines could be used to appropriately model it.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F2" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-2-1 xref-fig-2-2 xref-fig-2-3 xref-fig-2-4"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;337287v4/FIG2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig2</object-id><label>Fig 2.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-2"><title hwp:id="title-6">Comparison of genetic profiles between MET500 breast cancer samples and CCLE breast cancer cell lines.</title><p hwp:id="p-9">(a) Somatic mutation profile of the 75 genes across MET500 breast cancer samples and CCLE breast cancer cell lines.

To address this question, we examined the mutation spectrum of the 32 genes that were mutated in at least 50% of the breast cancer cell lines. Surprisingly, 25 of them had low mutation frequency (&lt; 0.05) in MET500 breast cancer samples. Further analysis of somatic mutation profiles of the 25 genes in TCGA breast cancer samples confirmed their hypermutations were specific to breast cancer cell lines (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-3" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig S1c</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-11">In addition to somatic mutation spectrum, we also compared copy number variation (CNV) profiles between MET500 breast cancer samples and CCLE breast cancer cell lines. We observed a high correlation of median-CNV values across the 1,630 commonly genotyped genes (spearman rank correlation = 0.81, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-2" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig 2b</xref>). However, we also noticed that the gain-of-copy-number events in cell lines appeared to resemble metastatic breast cancer while loss-of-copy-number events did not. For the 711 genes showing copy-number-loss in CCLE breast cancer cell lines (median-CNV &lt; 0), their cell line derived median-CNV values were significantly lower than that from MET500 breast cancer samples; however, no significant difference was detected in the 919 genes with copy-number-gain (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-4" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig S1d</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-12">Out of the 57 CCLE breast cancer cell lines, 24 were derived from metastatic sites (Table S2). We further divided the cell lines into two groups (according to whether they were derived from metastatic sites or not) and then compared the CNV profile of each group with MET500 breast cancer samples. We found cell lines derived from metastatic sites more closely resembled the CNV status of the 109 genes with high copy-number-gain (median-CNV &gt;= 0.4) in MET500 breast cancer samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-3" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig 2c</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-4" hwp:rel-id="F2">2d</xref>, and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-5" hwp:rel-id="F7">Fig S1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-7">Correlating CCLE breast cancer cell lines with metastatic breast cancer samples using transcriptome data</title><p hwp:id="p-13">Transcriptome correlation analysis (TC analysis) is proven to be an effective approach to evaluate the suitability of cell lines for research purpose<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, we performed TC analysis and ranked all 1,019 CCLE cell lines according to their transcriptome-similarly with MET500 breast cancer samples (see Methods).

For each of them, we performed metastatic-site-specific TC analysis (i.e., compute transcriptome-similarity of cell lines with samples derived from a specific metastatic site) and found the results were highly correlated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-2" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig 3b</xref>) with MDA-MB-415 being the most correlated cell line for both sites.

To address this question, we first determined the PAM50 subtype of MET500 breast cancer samples with R package genefu then applied t-SNE to visualize them (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). We found Basal-like samples clustered together and separated from other subtypes; additionally, the majority of LuminalA/LuminalB/Her2-enriched/Normal-like samples were mixed together except two skin-derived samples. HER2-enriched samples seemed to be separated from LuminalA/LuminalB samples but the boundary was not clear. These results suggested that subtype information was well maintained in metastatic breast cancer samples and additionally confirmed the feasibility of using PAM50 for subtyping metastatic breast cancer though it was initially developed using primary breast cancer data. We further confirmed the subtyping results by performing the same analysis on a combined dataset which contains both MET500 and TCGA breast cancer samples (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-2" hwp:rel-id="F8">Fig S2b</xref>). Next, we performed subtype-specific TC analysis (i.e., compute transcriptome-similarity of cell lines with samples of a specific subtype) and found high correlation within LuminalA/LuminalB/Her2-enriched subtypes, in contrast to their relatively lower correlation to Basal-like subtype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-4" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig 3d</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-17">To confirm the robustness of our TC analysis on MET500 dataset, we searched the GEO database and assembled a microarray dataset containing the expression value of another 103 metastatic breast cancer samples, and then repeated the above analysis. Results obtained from two the datasets were highly consistent with each other. First, there was a large overlap of the top-ranked cell lines. Out of the 10 cell lines having highest transcriptome-similarity with the 103 metastatic breast cancer samples, six of them were within the 10 cell lines having highest transcriptome-similarity with MET500 breast cancer samples. Second, both metastatic-site-specific and subtype-specific TC analysis results showed high correlations (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-9-1" hwp:rel-id="F9">Fig S3</xref>). Due to such high consistency, it is not surprising that we observed similar correlation trends in metastatic-site-specific (and subtype-specific) TC analysis results (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-10-1" hwp:rel-id="F10">Fig S4</xref>, <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-11-1" hwp:rel-id="F11">S5</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-18">About 24% of the 103 samples in the microarray dataset were derived from bone.

Given a subtype, we noticed that for a random CCLE cell line, its transcriptome-similarity with MET500 breast cancer samples of that subtype approximately followed a normal distribution (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-13-1" hwp:rel-id="F13">Fig S7</xref>). Therefore, those breast cancer cell lines showing significantly higher transcriptome-similarity were considered as suitable. Driven by this finding, for each subtype we first fit a normal distribution (the null distribution) with the transcriptome-similarity values (derived from subtype-specific TC analysis) of all non-breast-cancer cell lines and then assigned each of the 57 breast cancer cell lines a right-tailed p-value. The most significant cell lines for LuminalA, LuminalB, Her2-enriched, and Basal-like subtypes were MDA-MB-415 (p-value =3.59e-05), BT483 (p-value=2.22e-07), EFM192A (p-value=0.11e-and HCC70 (p-value =0.40e-03), respectively. Using a criteria of FDR &lt;= 0.01, we identified 20, 28 and 24 suitable cell lines for LuminalA, LuminalB, and Her2-enriched subtypes respectively. Notably, most of these significant cell lines were derived from metastatic sites and 18 were shared by the three subtypes. Surprisingly, no cell line passed the criterion for Basal-like subtype. We further examined whether this was due to the limited number of Basal-like MET500 breast cancer samples, but found that the number of LuminalA samples was even less than that of Basal-like samples. After we used a more loosened FDR cutoff of 0.05, we obtained 22 suitable cell lines for Basal-like subtype. All statistical testing results are listed in Table S3.</p><p hwp:id="p-20">We next searched PubMed to examine the popularity of the 57 breast cancer cell lines (see Methods and Table S2). MCF7 is most commonly used in metastatic breast cancer research (43.6% of total PubMed citations).

Following MCF7 is MDA-MB-231 (40.2% of total PubMed citations); however, it was not a suitable cell line for any subtype. The third most commonly used cell line was T47D (3.9% of total PubMed citations), which was a suitable cell line for LuminalA and Her2-enriched subtypes. It did not show significantly lower correlation with LuminalA MET500 breast cancer samples than MDA-MB-415 (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-14-2" hwp:rel-id="F14">Fig S8b</xref>); however, compared to EFM192A, it was significantly less correlated with Her2-enriched MET500 breast cancer samples (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-14-3" hwp:rel-id="F14">Fig S8c</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-21">While the triple negative cell line MDA-MB-231 is one of the most frequently used cell lines in metastatic breast cancer research, it might not be the most suitable cell line to model metastasis biology in breast cancer.

For non-Basal-like subtypes, 2,380 genes (2,179 up-regulated, 201 down-regulated) were identified as differentially expressed in both MET500-vs-CCLE and MET500-vs-organoids comparisons. For Basal-like subtype, there were 1,378 common differential expressed (DE) genes (1,117 up-regulated, 261 down-regulated). After intersecting the above two common DE gene lists, we finally obtained 1,016 subtype-and-model-independent DE genes (948 up-regulated, 68 down-regulated) and then performed GO enrichment analysis. For the 948 up-regulated ones, 30 GO terms were identified as significant (FDR &lt; 0.001) and most of them were immune-related, illustrating the large gap between culture media and tumor microenvironment (Table S4). The two terms “platelet degranulation”, and “chemotaxis” were also detected as significant. Besides microenvironment, our results also implicated the difference of intrinsic characteristics between metastatic breast cancer cells and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> models. For example, the enrichment on “steroid metabolic process” suggested that neither cell lines nor organoids resembled the reprogrammed metabolism of metastatic breast cancer sufficiently. Likewise, the enrichment on “cell adhesion” indicated that the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> models may not recapitulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition-related process of metastatic breast cancer. Surprisingly, for the 68 down-regulated subtype-and-model-independent DE genes, no GO terms passed the FDR &lt; 0.001 criteria, which could be due to the small gene number.

The genetic profile comparison showed that breast cancer cell lines poorly recaptured mutation patterns of metastatic breast cancer samples, while their CNV profiles were more consistent. Moreover, it is worth noting that cell lines carried many specific genomic alternations, possibly due to culture effects. Examples included the 25 genes presenting cell-line-specific hypermutation. Such large genetic differences and variations revealed by the comparison indicates the importance of selecting cell lines to represent heterogeneous metastatic cancer samples. This study investigated two important factors (i.e., metastatic site and cancer subtype) that need to be considered during cell line selection.</p><p hwp:id="p-34">Metastatic sites have their distinct microenvironment that has large impact in shaping the genomic profiles of metastatic cancer cells. However, the metastatic-site-specific TC analysis did not identify cell lines with metastatic-site-specific suitability, which seems not to reflect the impact of microenvironment. Further differential gene expression analysis revealed higher expression of immune related genes in metastatic cancer samples (compared to cell lines), suggesting that the media used to culture cancer cell lines did not model tumor microenvironment appropriately. Therefore, we conclude cell lines do not carry indicative genomic signatures that are shaped by the microenvironment of individual metastatic sites and that is the reason why we did not find metastatic-site-specific cell lines.</p><p hwp:id="p-35">Breast cancer is quite heterogeneous and we showed that PAM50 subtypes were maintained in metastatic breast cancer cells. Considering the large genomic difference between Basal-like and other subtypes, it is not surprising that in subtype-specific TC analysis Basal-like subtype showed lower correlation with others. Prior to this study, significant research had been completed to select representative cell lines as models for breast cancer, but the subtype information was not taken into consideration. Our analysis reveals the importance and necessity of subtype-specific cell line selection. In the future as data continues to accumulate, more factors can be considered for appropriate cell line selection and we can start building an ad-hoc mapping algorithm: inputs would be the characteristics of metastatic cancer samples (subtype, metastatic site, even age, race, stage etc.) as well as the specific scientific question of interest and the output would be a list of appropriate cell lines.</p><p hwp:id="p-36">We picked out suitable cell lines according to subtype-specific TC analysis results. Surprisingly, we found MDA-MB-231, the widely-used triple-negative cell line in metastatic breast cancer research, was dramatically different from Basal-like metastatic breast cancer samples. As Basal-like breast cancer is itself highly heterogeneous, we could not exclude the possibility that MDA-MB-231 represents a rare subtype not included in the MET500 dataset. According to our analysis, HCC70 seems to be a better model, but this does not mean it can be directly employed to study cancer metastasis as many other criteria are needed for the assessment.</p><p hwp:id="p-37">Organoids are recently established using 3D culture methods. Our analysis suggested that compared to cell lines, they resemble the transcriptome of patient samples more closely, which is a critical characteristic in drug testing. It is also important to note that cell lines evaluated in our study were established much earlier than organoids. During culturing process, they could have accumulated additional genomic alternations, which may partially explain why organoids are more tightly correlated with patient samples. In addition, through gene set differential activity analysis, we showed that some gene sets had organoid-specific activity. Recent studies have shown that organoids preserve the histological architecture, gene expression, and genomic landscape of the original tumor<sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref></sup>. Together with our comparative studies, we conclude that the value of organoids in translational research remains unknown, while their high genomic similarity with patient samples warrants further investigation.</p><p hwp:id="p-38">In summary, by leveraging publicly available genomic data, we comprehensively evaluated the suitability of breast cancer cell lines as models for metastatic breast cancer. Our study introduces a simple framework for cell line selection which can be easily extended to other cancer types. Although there are concerns about data quality and discrepancies between different studies/platforms, our large-scale analysis and cross-platform validation hopefully addresses these concerns and demonstrates the power of leveraging open data to gain biological insights of cancer metastasis.
