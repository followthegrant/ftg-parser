However, part of the difficulty in translating findings from mouse is that, despite high levels of gene conservation, regulatory control networks between human and mouse have been extensively rewired. To understand common themes of regulatory control we look beyond physical sharing of regulatory sequence, where extensive turnover of individual transcription factor binding sites complicates cross-species prediction of specific functions, and instead look at conserved properties of the regulatory code itself. We define regulatory conservation in terms of a grammar with shared, species-specific, and tissue-specific segments, and show that this grammar is more predictive of shared chromatin states and gene expression profiles than shared occupancy alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate a marked enrichment of disease associated variation in conserved grammatical patterns. These findings offer new understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms shared between human and mouse.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Keywords</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">Gene regulation</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">Cis-regulatory modules</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">Regulatory conservation</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">Transcription factor</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">Genomics</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-6">Human</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-7">ChIP-seq</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="34"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-3">BACKGROUND</title><p hwp:id="p-4">As genome-wide datasets, including DNase hypersensitivity, transcription factor (TF) binding, and chromatin modifications, accumulate across multiple tissues and species, categorizing and ascribing functions to newly-identified putative regulatory sequences is a growing challenge. Traditionally, we have relied heavily on comparative genomics to make such predictions, either by extrapolating the function of a sequence based on known function of the orthologous sequence in another species, or by integrating data from multiple species to surmise the most likely function for a region. This strategy is effective within coding sequences, which have a fairly simple underlying grammar, retain relatively stable functions through evolutionary time, and are marked by extensive sequence conservation at the nucleotide level. However, while active regulatory elements are associated with a variety of characteristic functional markers (e.g., open chromatin and specific histone modifications), the underlying regulatory landscape is much more fluid between cells and species than for coding genes. Although we can use such measures to catalog putative regulatory regions across multiple species, detailed analyses of the underlying sequence conservation and effects on expression of nearby genes have shown limited correlation between positional conservation and regulatory output. Furthermore, we know that a large fraction of functional regulatory elements exist in sequences that are unique to individual species, such as transposable element (TE) insertions, which have been shown in multiple species to be frequently exapted for regulatory purposes. For example, it has been shown that TEs of the B2 SINE family have actively dispersed CTCF binding sites throughout the mouse genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>], and that these B2 SINE insertions serve as anchor points for mouse-specific structural contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. It hardly needs to be stated that phylogenetic comparisons are not informative for these sequences.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">An alternative approach to predicting the function of regulatory sequences is to focus not on the underlying conservation of a given regulatory locus, but rather the regulatory grammar expressed in the combinations of co-bound transcription factors, or cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) we observe in different species and tissues. Indeed, there is considerable interest in CRMs as drivers of adaptive evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>]. We know that most gene expression is mediated by combinations of TFs acting cooperatively to regulate their target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>], that distinct sets of TFs elicit specific and reproducible gene expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>], and that these regulatory outcomes often directly translate between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>]. This suggests that a conserved regulatory grammar may underlie control of common physiological pathways, and that species-specific modifications to this grammar and/or how it is used may explain much of the complexity in gene expression programs among species. However, the evolution of this regulatory grammar has never been extensively analyzed, in part because of the inherent complexity of the regulatory landscape, given that there are ~1200 TFs predicted in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-6">Because it is intractable to directly infer the functions of all possible combinations of TFs, we need to simplify the regulatory landscape. Much like in natural language, we expect that many of the regulatory sentences we observe in mammalian genomes will share equivalent meanings. As such, we can apply machine learning techniques to reduce the regulatory landscape into sets of significantly co-occurring combinations of TFs. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are particularly well-suited for this purpose because of their ability to project such high-dimensional data onto a two-dimensional grid topology, facilitating easy comparisons of various properties of the data. SOMs have been previously used to describe CRM data in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>] and across distantly-related species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>]. Here we apply this method to sets of matched immune cells from human and mouse; as far as we are aware, this is the first application of an SOM to infer shared and species-specific regulatory properties across two mammalian species.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">The mouse has long represented a flexible genetic system for exploring human genetic disease. However, because of the estimated 75 million years of divergence separating these two species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>], only ~40% of their DNA sequences are directly alignable. We know that protein coding genes remain largely unchanged while noncoding sequences, which harbor most of the gene regulatory circuitry, have undergone extensive turnover. We know that, even though the pool of TFs and their binding specificities have changed little among vertebrates, the majority of occupied TF binding sites (TFBSs) are species-specific, even in the same tissue among closely related vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>]. At the evolutionary distance between human and mouse, sequence turnover frequently changes the order, orientation, and position of TFBSs relative to their target genes even when regulatory outcomes show evidence of conservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>]. Such sequence-level changes are likely to obscure conserved patterns of combinatorial TF binding, complicating the use of sequence conservation to elucidate the regulatory code. If we are better able to map the similarities and differences in regulatory control between species, we may be able to predict which genetic pathways retain similar properties and thus which findings from mouse are likely to translate back to the human system.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Recent advances in sequencing technologies have allowed us to begin mapping regulatory regions in human and mouse and started revealing the extent of turnover at regulatory sites in human and mouse. Early work has demonstrated that only 40-50% of human and mouse regulatory elements reside in orthologous sequence, and, at a majority of these sites, TF binding is not maintained between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>]. However, the functional consequences of such changes are unclear. To shed the inherent constraints of methods based on shared-occupancy, we explore regulatory evolution by analyzing conserved combinatorial TF binding patterns independent of their sequence context. We do so by simultaneously comparing TF ChIP-seq co-binding profiles from four human and mouse cell types using a SOM, ignoring factors such as the order, orientation, spacing, cell, and species context. By doing so, we allow conserved and divergent properties of the regulatory code to emerge in the partitioning of co-binding profiles, or grammatical patterns, identified by the SOM. We demonstrate that much of the regulatory logic between these human and mouse cell types has remained intact despite extensive turnover at the level of individual TFBSs. By mapping additional annotations to the SOM map, we further show that grammatical patterns show stable functional signatures, are correlated with tissue-specific expression profiles of nearby genes, and are enriched for functional GWAS variants for relevant human phenotypes, making them potentially useful predictors of functional specificity and conservation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-4">RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-5">Grammatical patterns are significantly more conserved than individual regulatory loci</title><p hwp:id="p-9">We used a self-organizing map (SOM) to learn significantly occurring co-binding patterns, which we call grammatical patterns, for 27 general TFs among two sets of biologically matched cell types from human and mouse: K562 (K) and MEL (M) myeloid cells, and GM12878 (G) and CH12 (C) lymphoid cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref></bold> and see Methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>].

Segments marked with a single cell label represent tissue/species-specific regulatory functions, which may be less conserved, while those spanning species and/or tissues are considered more conserved. Overall, the SOM partitions the dataset into 780 grammatical patterns, 593 of which are used in both species and 187 that are species-specific (103 mouse and 84 human). This represents a significant reduction in complexity compared to positional conservation. <bold>(B)</bold> Positional classes describe regulatory conservation in terms of shared sequence occupancy. We define a regulatory locus as a distinct location within one species and its orthologous locus (if present) in the other species.

It seems likely that this repurposing is based, at least in part, on changes in TF binding across species, given that multiple studies have shown that only a minority of CRMs and DHS shared between human and mouse also share equivalent sets of TFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>]. In support of this hypothesis, Vierstra et al. also report that positional and operational TF binding conservation were strongly enriched in DHS with shared tissue activity while tissue-specific and cell fate-modifying TFs are specifically depleted in DHS that had been repurposed into a new tissue. These findings strongly suggest that the TF co-binding profile occupying a regulatory locus directly stipulates its function, independently of whether it is also active in other tissues/species. Notably, Vierstra et al. also found a corresponding enrichment of tissue-specific TFs in DHS that retained tissue-specific activity across species, strengthening the link between conserved regulatory grammar and conservation of function. Accordingly, it seems likely that changes in regulatory grammar are an important agent in regulatory evolution, and that regulatory grammar can be useful in predicting conserved and divergent regulatory sequence function.</p><p hwp:id="p-15">Here we extend the concept of positional conservation, first introduced by Vierstra et al.

Furthermore, we saw no clear association between grammatical class membership and evolutionary history of a CRM, with shared grammatical patterns contributing 88% of orthologous CRMs and 92% of non-orthologous CRMs. Therefore, although individual regulatory loci may be frequently repurposed, most of the TF co-binding patterns found in human and mouse appear to be deeply conserved. This suggests that the underlying regulatory logic by which specific regulatory outcomes are produced is also deeply conserved. Taken in context with previously reported findings, these results suggest that grammatical patterns likely reflect specific regulatory functions, and by extension, functional conservation, more closely than phylogenetic conservation. As such, grammatical patterns may be a useful tool for inferring whether positionally-conserved CRMs retain equivalent functions across species, as well as inferring the regulatory activities of non-orthologous CRMs, for which phylogenetic clues to their potential functions do not exist.</p></sec><sec id="s2b" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-8">Grammatical classes have stable functional signatures across orthologous and species-specific CRMs despite differential sequence conservation</title><p hwp:id="p-18">Given that only a minority of human and mouse CRMs are alignable between human and mouse, the remaining 50-70% of CRMs cannot be functionally classified using phylogenetic comparisons.

As expected, orthologous sequences contained systematically more PE than both losses and gains, and sequence conservation was correlated with the evolutionary age of the CRMs. The youngest elements, species-specific gains, showed the least overlap with PE, while PE intersection in losses occurred at an intermediate level relative to gains and orthologs (p-values &lt; 2.2e-240). Notably, evolutionary conservation in many CRMs appears to arise largely from direct TF binding, as shown by clustering of phastCons scores approaching 1 within 50bp of ChIP-seq peak summits, and we see the same correlation between evolutionary age and phastCons scores near ChIP-seq peak summits evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-4" hwp:rel-id="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> (fig.

If our hypothesis is correct, we would surmise that ACS would match between all/most CRMs from cells belonging to a given grammatical class, while CRMs from cells that do not belong to a grammatical class (despite having been assigned to the given grammatical pattern) would be less likely to share the “correct” ACS. We tested this hypothesis by counting the proportion of grammatical patterns in which at least 50% of member CRMs from cell types belonging to its grammatical class contained a given ACS while a majority of member CRMs from other cell types lacked a matching ACS (fig. S6A). In all, 694 of the 780 grammatical patterns showed evidence of ACS specificity, according to the 50% threshold. In accordance with our hypothesis, ACS annotations within member cells closely corresponded to the grammatical classes of most patterns, with a remarkable 99.8% match rate among cells belonging to the parent grammatical class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-3" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, fig.

This level of specificity remained unchanged even with increasing thresholds for chromatin state specificity up to 100%, although the total number of patterns meeting the inclusion criterion decreased steadily as the threshold increased (fig. S8A-C). Interestingly, we see this class-specific pattern of ACS enrichment only when comparisons are referenced to cells belonging to a given grammatical class, but not when nonmember cells are used as the reference (fig. S7A). This phenomenon was not observed among positional classes (fig. S7B). Beyond simply demonstrating the predictive value of grammatical patterns regarding underlying ACS, these data also suggest that most grammatical patterns are active in different chromatin components, which may be expected based on the spatial biases we observed for most grammatical patterns.</p><p hwp:id="p-25">For comparison, we asked how often positional classes matched underlying ACS conservation: i.e., that all occupied sequences share a given ACS while unoccupied sequences lack a matching ACS annotation. To determine if this is true, we counted the proportion of positionally-conserved loci at which all cells belonging to its positional class share a given ACS, while no cells outside the positional class carry the matching ACS (fig. S6B). To be considered a match, both of these criteria had to be met; loci failing to meet one or both criteria were classified into two mismatch categories: “mismatch 1”, where the same ACS was present in nonmember cell(s), and “mismatch 2”, where one or more member cells lacked the ACS. Notably, the “match” rates we observed at positionally-conserved loci were much lower that for grammatical patterns: 50% at promoters, 45% at strong enhancers and 43% at weak enhancers which is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-4" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, fig.

Relaxing the requirement for strict matching between all occupied cells at a locus yielded only modest increased in match rate (fig. S8D-E). This suggests that shared occupancy, in addition to being a poor predictor of grammatical patterns, also has limited predictive value in terms of conservation of functional chromatin annotations when compared to specific regulatory content. This can be easily seen in a plot of 10 randomly selected loci from the CG class, showing discordance between the positional classes, implied by occupancy, and ACS in 8 of 10 cases (fig. S5D). By contrast, grammatical patterns appear to be informative in terms of both categorical regulatory activities, as captured by their correlations with specific ACS, and of the depth of functional conservation of their underlying regulatory grammar, as expressed by the cell-specificity of their cognate ACS.</p></sec><sec id="s2d" hwp:id="sec-6"><title hwp:id="title-12">Tissue and species-specificity of CRMs and grammatical classes correlate significantly with gene expression patterns</title><p hwp:id="p-26">To expand on our finding that grammatical classes are associated with cell-specificity of underlying ACS, we wanted to see if there was also an association between grammatical classes and cell-specific gene expression patterns.

Notably, the majority of enriched ontology terms relate either directly to immunity, autoimmune disorders, or to cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorders, and cancer, all of which have an underlying basis in, or known correlations with immune system dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">42</xref>].

It is interesting to note that our top term, “Inflamatory Bowel Disease”, was also significantly enriched in occupancy conserved TFBSs in GM12878 cells in Cheng et al.

However, significant enrichments were also observed in GM12878-specific (G), Human-specific (KG), Myeloid-specific (MK), and two-cell-mixed (CK) grammatical classes. Surprisingly, we also see significant enrichments for 8 terms in the mouse-specific M and C classes. It is unclear how these regulatory patterns might influence the etiology of human disease. Nevertheless, the fact that the majority of GWAS SNPs affect conserved grammatical patterns suggests their importance in maintaining proper regulatory control of disease-related pathways. Accordingly, it is possible that enrichment for these patterns may indicate pathways for which regulatory control is conserved between human and mouse and, as such, may represent promising targets for translational research. Conversely, given the evidence we see for enrichment of species-specific grammatical patterns near genes with divergent expression, these patterns may highlight pathways for which regulation has significantly diverged in mouse, making them less promising as models for human disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2f" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-16">Human-Mouse SOM Data Browser</title><p hwp:id="p-37">To facilitate data analysis and visualization, the SOM data are presented in a public browser with extensive search and visualization capabilities (<ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="https://boylelab.med.umich.edu/SOMbrowser/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://boylelab.med.umich.edu/SOMbrowser/" hwp:id="ext-link-2">https://boylelab.med.umich.edu/SOMbrowser/</ext-link>).

We have shown widespread differences in the specific regulatory logic occupying positionally-conserved loci across species and cell types, and corresponding differences in underlying chromatin states, with positional conservation being a poor predictor for shared chromatin states between species and cell types.</p><p hwp:id="p-39">By contrast, grammatical patterns have stable functional signatures that span both species and tissue, and these signatures remain relatively constant regardless of the evolutionary history of CRMs. This property gives grammatical patterns a distinct advantage for predicting the function of regulatory sequences compared to methods relying on positional conservation of TF occupancy and/or other functional annotations, given that we know a large fraction of regulatory sequence does not map between even closely-related species. This is of particular importance given that transposable element insertions have been shown to propagate TFBSs within multiple mammalian genomes, and these insertions have been shown to directly modify certain regulatory functions in the genome, including formation and/or maintenance of chromatin loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. Our results show that species-specific CRMs share the same functional signatures as positionally-conserved CRMs within their grammatical pattern. Surprisingly, we show that these species-specific CRMs also overwhelmingly carry conserved regulatory logic.</p><p hwp:id="p-40">We also show a clear correlation between the inherent tissue/species-specificity of grammatical patterns, expressed by their grammatical class, with matching tissue/species-specific gene expression patterns. This not only supports our theory that grammatical patterns are predictive of tissue/species-specific regulatory activities, but also suggests that grammatical classes capture the functional conservation of regulatory logic across tissues and species. As such, patterns specific to a given tissue may offer unique opportunities to understand the regulatory basis of relevant diseases, especially when these patterns are shared across species. By contrast, grammatical patterns specific to a single cell type may highlight disease-related regulatory mechanisms that have diverged between species. Similarly, species-specific grammatical patterns may represent emergent portions of the regulatory language with potentially causal roles in evolutionary divergence and speciation.</p><p hwp:id="p-41">We show that grammatical patterns are significantly enriched for causal GWAS SNPs relevant to immune phenotypes, and that these enrichments fall both in shared and species-specific regulatory logic. It is interesting to note that we found relevant enrichments not only among CRMs with human-specific grammatical patterns, but also in human CRMs labelled with mouse-specific grammatical patterns. While it is not immediately clear what might explain this phenomenon, one appealing hypothesis is that these CRMs represent inappropriate, out-of-context use of these regulatory instructions which may, in itself, lead to a diseased state. In this framework, the underlying GWAS SNPs may directly cause the grammatical pattern to shift from a human pattern to a mouse pattern by creating or ablating a TFBS, thus leading to target gene dysregulation. Indeed, the fact that these experiments were run using immortalized cell lines may increase the likelihood of observing such cases.</p><p hwp:id="p-42">While previous studies have used shared occupancy across species as a proxy for shared regulatory logic, we find that the functional annotations used in this study correlate better with grammatical patterns than conserved occupancy, with the notable exception of PhastCons conservation. We find that the segmentation of TF co-binding patterns with SOMs allows a much clearer picture of underlying regulatory potential and conservation than does looking at the regulatory landscape through a purely phylogenetic lens. SOMs have been used previously to study gene regulation, in a study of TFBS co-binding profiles across multiple human cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>], across distant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>], and, most recently, to investigate combinatorial regulatory logic in the mouse liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">43</xref>]. However, as far as we know, this is the first application of these methods to groups of cells spanning more than one mammalian species.</p><p hwp:id="p-43">Although the analysis presented by Dubois-Chevalier et al. was referenced specifically to the liver-specific TF NR1H4, and contains few overlapping TFs with our dataset, we note important parallels between their results and ours. Primary among these are the ability of the SOM to separate grammatical patterns (termed trans-regulatory modules, or TRMs, in their paper) into clusters with chromatin signatures characteristic of enhancers or promoters, and the association of distinct sets of TRMs with expression (and dysregulation) of liver-specific genes. We observed both of these characteristics in our dataset as well, in the predictive value of grammatical patterns for underlying chromatin states, and in enrichments of tissue/species-specific grammatical patterns near genes with corresponding expression.</p><p hwp:id="p-44">Another group has applied SOMs to classify regulatory sequences into cell-specific and shared functional groups across a number of human cell types based on histone modifications, including those used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref>]. They went on to map binding data and motifs for several general and tissue-specific TFs to their dataset, and found that tissue-specific sets of histone modifications were significantly correlated with presence of corresponding tissue-specific TF motifs and ChIP-seq peaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref>]. While it is tempting to relate these data to our, seemingly contradictory, finding that matched chromatin states have little predictive value for underlying TF binding, such a comparison may be misleading for two reasons. First, Mortazavi et al. found that tissue-specific epigenetic signatures predicted only presence of tissue-specific TFs and motifs. Unfortunately, our dataset does not contain appropriate tissue-specific TFs on which we could base a comparison. Second, our results are based on genome annotation using a seven-state chromHMM model. As a result, the genome segmentation used in our analysis is much coarser than the 1350-unit SOM on which their results are based. It is possible that, by dissecting the epigenetic landscape in such detail, one can find subsets of co-occurring modification that segregate distinctly with specific sets of co-bound TFs. However, their failure to find specific enrichments of any TFs within SOM units shared between all cells suggests that even highly detailed epigenetic annotations may not accurately predict underlying regulatory logic in many cases.</p><p hwp:id="p-45">We must note that the focus of this study on only two sets of matched cell types with immune functions, owing solely to the availability of sufficient ChIP-seq data in the ENCODE repository at the time of the analysis, may restrict how broadly these specific results can be interpreted. Similarly, the use of immortalized cell lines may have introduced confounding factors, as it is currently not known how cancer affects the regulatory lexicon as cells transition from a normal state to a diseased state. However, it is encouraging that we found such a strong overlap between regulatory patterns present across all four cells, which suggests that most of the regulatory landscape has remained intact despite the many other genomic and physiological changes these cell lines harbor. However, another interpretation would be that all cancer cells carry similar changes in regulatory grammar, and we cannot rule this out using the current dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-10"><title hwp:id="title-18">CONCLUSIONS</title><p hwp:id="p-46">On the whole, these data demonstrate that grammatical patterns can augment and extend our ability to classify and predict regulatory functions beyond use of positional conservation. The SOM allows us to segment the regulatory landscape into grammatical patterns that may be shared among all, or specific to any subset of, species and cells used in map construction. We have shown that these grammatical patterns are predictive of underlying functional annotations, correlate with species-specific gene expression patterns, and are enriched for GWAS SNPs for relevant phenotypes. The marked enrichment of GWAS SNPs within highly-conserved grammatical patterns further suggests that they may be a useful tool to identify disease mechanisms and pathways best suited for translational research. We believe that, as data become available in a broader array of primary and immortalized cell types, we can gain great insight into both shared and divergent portions of regulatory grammar between human and mouse. This may shed further light on why mouse models often fail to translate to the human system, and highlight pathways that are most likely conserved in their regulation between both species.</p></sec><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-11"><title hwp:id="title-19">Methods</title><sec id="s5a" hwp:id="sec-12"><title hwp:id="title-20">Preparation of the Dataset</title><p hwp:id="p-47">Data for the analyses performed in this manuscript are available from the ENCODE project (<ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="https://www.encodeproject.org/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/" hwp:id="ext-link-3">https://www.encodeproject.org/</ext-link>).

Briefly, we train a 47x34 toroidal SOM with hexagonal neurons with an update radius of ⅓ map size and alpha of 0.05 for 100 epochs. We repeat this for 1000 trials to minimize the quantization error. We perform this analysis with a modified form of the kohonen R package available through our github site here: <ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/kohonen2" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/kohonen2" hwp:id="ext-link-4">https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/kohonen2</ext-link></p><p hwp:id="p-50">In contrast to our previous methods, we also performed 10,000 random permutations of the SOM using the same set of parameters. We permuted labels of TFs on each region but kept cell type and organism constant for those labels. This allowed for us to correct for patterns that occur at low frequency by chance and for factors with many apparent associations due to their high frequency in the datasets. Using this empirical distribution we considered a neuron significant if it had an empirical p-value &lt;= 0.0001 (i.e. has not appeared in any random permutations). In order to avoid thresholding issues, we then only considered differential regions to be those with an empirical p-value &gt; 0.95 in non-enriched cell types.</p><p hwp:id="p-51">Each hexagonal neuron was assigned a corresponding grammatical pattern by enumerating occurrences of each of the 27 TFs in all CRMs assigned to a given neuron. If a TF occurred in at least 90% of CRMs assigned to a neuron, it was considered to be an integral part of the grammatical pattern. Similarly, grammatical classes were assigned using the empirical p-values calculated for each cell, requiring an empirical p-value &lt;= 0.0001 to include a cell type in a pattern’s grammatical class and a p-value &gt; 0.95 to exclude a cell from a pattern’s grammatical class.

Briefly, CRMs were selected at random from the human or mouse dataset, without replacement, and the length, GC content and distance from the midpoint of the element to the nearest TSS were calculated and assigned to one of five bins: 0-500bp, 501-2,000bp, 2,001-5,000bp, 5,001-10,000bp, and &gt;10,000bp. A maximum of 1000 sequences of matching length were randomly drawn from the genome, excluding the CRMs themselves, until a sequence with GC content +/- 10% and TSS distance within the same distance bin was found. This sequence was labeled with all metadata from its source module, stored within the background dataset and masked from the genomic fasta to prohibit redrawing the same sequence. This process was repeated until either a) all CRMs were exhausted, b) all background windows were exhausted, or c) 100,000 background sequences were drawn. For quality control, density plots of the distributions of length, GC content and TSS distance were superimposed and visually assessed, and means were compared using the t.test function in R.

This allowed us to unambiguously assign 100% of unmapped CRMs and background sequences as either gains or losses on a specific branch. Numeric orthology codes were reassigned for these elements in the database: 3 = mouse gain, 4 = human gain, 5 = mouse loss, 6 = human loss. These codes were used to extract CRMs in each orthology class for later steps in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s5f" hwp:id="sec-17"><title hwp:id="title-25">Analysis of Conservation</title><p hwp:id="p-56">PhastCons conserved elements and base-wise scores for the human (46-way placental mammals) and mouse (30-way placental mammals) genomes were retrieved from the UCSC download portal in bed format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">45</xref>].

Predictions with multiple-testing-corrected p-values &lt;= 0.05 were retained as differentially-expressed. From these, we selected gene sets with expression specific to a given species or cell type based on the predicted partial slope coefficients in the full model. For example, myeloid specific genes were selected by setting a lower-bound of 4 on the "cellTypeMyeloid coefficient and upper, indicating a positive correlation with expression in myeloid cells, and lower bounds of 0.05 and -0.05 on the "speciesMm9 coefficient, indicating little or no correlation with species.
