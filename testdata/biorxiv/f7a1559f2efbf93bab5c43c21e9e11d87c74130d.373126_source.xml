In most cases, different survey techniques are required for different crops because of variation in planting design, floral density, spatial distribution of flowers or where additional factors such as the variation in plant vigour are being explored. Here we provide survey techniques that have been, or are currently being employed to survey flower visitors across different crops in New Zealand and Australia. Future studies may consider the use of similar designs that will allow for increased standardisation within and between locations and studies. This will provide opportunities for improved direct comparisons between studies, and the ability to combine data sets to address broader spatial-scale questions regarding insect pollination.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="25"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

As part of research undertaken by The New Zealand Institute for Plant &amp; Food Research Limited and the University of New England (New South Wales, Australia) to assess the role of managed honey bees and wild pollinators, we designed several standardised survey techniques to assess pollinator abundance and diversity within avocado (<italic toggle="yes">Persea americana</italic>), blueberry (<italic toggle="yes">Vaccinium spp</italic>.) kiwifruit (<italic toggle="yes">Actinidia deliciosa</italic>), macadamia (<italic toggle="yes">Macadamia integrifolia</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">M. tetraphylla</italic>) and mango (<italic toggle="yes">Mangifera indica</italic>) orchards located either in New Zealand or Australia. These add to the flower-visitor survey techniques for the insect seed crops onion (<italic toggle="yes">Allium cepa</italic>), carrot (<italic toggle="yes">Daucus carota</italic>), radish (<italic toggle="yes">Raphinus sativus</italic>), pak choi (<italic toggle="yes">Brassica rapa</italic> subsp. c<italic toggle="yes">hinensis</italic>) and white clover (<italic toggle="yes">Trifolium repens</italic>) that are described by Howett et al. (2009; 2013). Orchard design, the spatial distribution of flowers, and the need to design surveys to address the objectives of each study has required the development of multiple survey methods. These methods have been employed extensively across orchards to understand the abundance and diversity of insect flower visitors within and between orchard blocks and in some instances, between plants within blocks. Methods are described here in alphabetical order by crop type.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><label>1.</label><title hwp:id="title-3">Avocados</title><p hwp:id="p-4">Avocado flowers typically open twice, first as a pistillate (functionally female) flower and then as a staminate (functionally male) flower the following day. Staminate flowers can be distinguished by the positioning of the stamens with anthers (often dehiscing pollen) close to the pistil whereas, for pistillate flowers, stamens with non-dehiscing anthers are positioned prostrate against the petals. Flowers often open for relatively short periods during the day of time (commonly 2â4 hours) and this is dependent on prior weather conditions. Staminate and pistillate flowers within trees often overlap for a short period of time (usually not much longer than half an hour).</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Many commercial orchards consist predominantly or entirely of trees of a single cultivar. In New Zealand and southern Australia (New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia), the most common commercially grown cultivar is âHassâ. Additional polleniser cultivars may also be planted within the orchard blocks. These flower in the opposite phase to the fruiting trees, producing staminate flowers when the fruiting trees are producing pistillate flowers and vice versa. The aim of planting pollenisers is to assist pollination by producing pollen that can be transferred by pollinators to the fruiting trees. In many cases, fruit set is greater when the pollen is from a different cultivar to the female flower.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">To help facilitate pollination, avocado growers often place hives of honey bees within their orchards, however, this is not universal. Other unmanaged flower visiting insect species have previously been noted visiting avocado flowers in New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">Read et al. 2017</xref>) and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Vithanage 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">Evans et al. 2011</xref>). Our surveys methods described here include counts of insect flower visitor to both âHassâ and polleniser trees when present.</p><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">Avocado survey method 1: New Zealand orchard blocks using a diagonal survey design</title><p hwp:id="p-7">This survey method was designed to assess flower visitor abundances and diversity within and between orchard blocks across New Zealand with trees that could be highly variable flowering intensity during peak flowering time.

Within each set, three trees were located in a single row and the other three in a single adjacent row. Within each of these rows, every second tree was selected as a survey tree and survey trees were positioned diagonally across the two rows. Therefore, survey trees in row 1 were 1, 3, and 5 and in row 2 they were trees 2, 4 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4 xref-fig-1-5 xref-fig-1-6 xref-fig-1-7"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;373126v1/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Figure 1:</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><p hwp:id="p-10">Survey design for assessing insect flower visitors in a New Zealand avocado orchard.

The flowering phase (staminate or pistillate flowers) of each tree was also recorded at each survey time. Wherever possible, surveys were conducted at a time of peak orchard flowering (mean pistillate flower count &gt; 40 pistillate phase flowers/quadrat count on more than 50% of trees). To account for variation in flowering intensity between blocks and trees, surveys of flowers per unit area were also conducted within each observation tree (described in the section âRecording Flowering Intensityâ).</p></sec><sec id="s2a4" hwp:id="sec-7"><title hwp:id="title-8">Survey method</title><p hwp:id="p-13">Only flowers between 0.5 m and 2.0 m above ground were surveyed for insect flower visitors. To restrict observations within this defined survey height, the observer vertically held a 1.5 m pole (dark green) near (25 Â± 15 cm) the tree side. The observer then walked slowly around the tree observing inflorescences at a distance of within 30 cm, counting flower-visiting insects around half the trees circumference (180Â°) for a period of 120 Â± 15 secs per tree. All flowers located from the outer canopy to the trunk of the tree were observed. This was possible because of the open nature of the canopy and the tendency for inflorescences to be located nearer the outer canopy of the tree than buried in foliage within the tree. Where a flower-visiting species was particularly abundant, a hand-held counter was used to record numbers. We surveyed the same sides of each tree located within the same row and the adjacent 180Â° of trees in the second row. Therefore, the side of each tree surveyed within each set faced inside the same row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-4" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2a5" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-9">Recording flower visitors</title><p hwp:id="p-14">Counts of flower visiting insects were recorded on a paper spreadsheet to species if possible, otherwise they were assigned to broader taxonomic groupings based on morphological characters. The paper spreadsheet was designed with listed taxa deemed most likely to be observed based on earlier preliminary observations. If an insect could not be identified through visual observation, the observer attempted to collect a specimen either directly into a jar containing tissue paper moistened with ethyl acetate for later identification or by first using a net from which the insect was transferred to a jar.</p></sec><sec id="s2a6" hwp:id="sec-9"><title hwp:id="title-10">Measurement of weather variables</title><p hwp:id="p-15">We measured wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity and light intensity (irradiance) (north, south and directly towards the sun). A Silva Windwatch was used to measure wind speed (km/h) over a 30 second period with minimum and maximum speeds recorded. Air temperature (Â°C) and relative humidity (%) were measured using a Thermo-Hydro recorder that was hung in full shade approximately 0.5 to 1.5 m above ground. Light intensity (watts/m<sup>2</sup>) was measured using a Daystar meter. All weather variables were measured just prior to conducting each insect flower-visitor survey (0900, 1200 and 1500h).</p></sec><sec id="s2a7" hwp:id="sec-10"><title hwp:id="title-11">Recording Flowering Intensity</title><p hwp:id="p-16">Flower-visitor surveys were coupled with surveys of flowering intensity that were conducted on the same day and on the same trees. Two separate counts for each tree were conducted during the day, one when trees were in their pistillate flowering phase and the other during their staminate phase. A single 75 Ã 75 cm<sup>2</sup> quadrat was used to count open flowers within a segment of the area that was surveyed for insect flower visitors. The quadrat was placed at a height of 1.0 m above ground and positioned at the midpoint of the insect survey transect (i.e. facing directly into the row). A piece of tape attached to the quadrat side assisted in determining the correct height.</p><p hwp:id="p-17">All inflorescences (budding, flowering, completed flowering) were initially counted separately within the area of the quadrat to the tree trunk when standing 50 cm directly behind the quadrat. Three inflorescences (regardless of the number of open flowers they contained) were then selected within the quadrat and marked with plastic tape. One in each of the following positions was tagged: (1) visually closest to the upper left-hand corner, (2) closest to the centre and (3) closest to the lower right-hand corner. To avoid sampling only inflorescences nearest to the quadrat (that was placed on the outer canopy), we chose the inflorescences that were closest to our quadrat points based on our field of view when standing 50 cm from the quadrat. Therefore, inflorescences close to the trunk could be selected if they were visually closest to the quadrat points. All open flowers were then counted on these inflorescences.</p><p hwp:id="p-18">A count of inflorescences per quadrat and flowers (staminate and pistillate phase) per marked inflorescence could then be used to estimate of the number of flowers per area surveyed for each set of trees. This calculation could then be used to estimate numbers of flower visitors per flower.</p></sec><sec id="s2a8" hwp:id="sec-11"><title hwp:id="title-12">Recording other tree parameters</title><p hwp:id="p-19">The height (estimated) and radius (measured with a tape) of each tree was also noted. Where trees were irregular in shape, measures of the tree radius at its greatest and minimum extent were recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b" hwp:id="sec-12"><title hwp:id="title-13">Avocado survey method 2: Australian orchard blocks using a diagonal survey design</title><p hwp:id="p-20">This survey method was designed to assess flower visitor abundances and diversity within and between orchard blocks across orchards in South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. The method was often conducted simultaneously with avocado survey method 3. The design was modified from avocado survey method 1 to match method 3 more closely (observations conducted around entire tree circumferences). As with avocado survey method 1, the data may then be combined with measures of pollinator efficiency to calculate pollinator effectiveness.</p><sec id="s2b1" hwp:id="sec-13"><title hwp:id="title-14">Flower-visitor surveys</title><p hwp:id="p-21">As in New Zealand, âHassâ is the most commonly grown cultivar for commercial fruit production in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales.

Macadamia produce approximately 100â300 florets within a raceme and several thousand racemes per tree during a flowering season. There are numerous cultivars of macadamia and these are grown as single cultivar or multiple cultivar blocks. In multiple cultivar blocks, growers commonly grow alternating rows of a different cultivar but growers may also grow different cultivars within the same row. Our surveys were conducted mostly within single cultivar blocks. Honey bee and stingless bee hives are occasionally placed within orchards, however, the numbers of hives growers have placed within their blocks can vary greatly. In Australia Honey bees and stingless bees are considered the most abundant pollinators but many other species, particularly beetles and flies also visit flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Vithanage &amp; Ironside 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">Heard &amp; Exley 1994</xref>) The review articles by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">Trueman (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">Howlett et al (2015)</xref> provide further detail on macadamia floral biology and pollination.</p><sec id="s5a" hwp:id="sec-56"><title hwp:id="title-57">Macadamia survey method 1: Australian orchard blocks using a diagonal survey design</title><p hwp:id="p-79">The survey method was designed to assess flower visitor abundances and diversity within and between orchard blocks in Queensland and New South Wales (Australia).</p><sec id="s5a1" hwp:id="sec-57"><title hwp:id="title-58">Flower-visitor surveys</title><p hwp:id="p-80">Surveys were conducted in flowering orchard blocks consisting of one cultivar, with the exception of two blocks that contained two cultivars.

Surveys were conducted under fine weather conditions (17â33Â°C) and when average wind speed was below 24 km/h. Where possible, orchards surveys were conducted when the block was considered at peak flowering (more than 50% of tree with &gt; 4 flowering racemes/m<sup>2</sup>). To account for variation in flowering intensity between blocks and trees, surveys of flowering racemes were also conducted within each observation tree (see recording flowering intensity below).</p></sec><sec id="s5a4" hwp:id="sec-60"><title hwp:id="title-61">Survey method</title><p hwp:id="p-84">The survey method was restricted to the side of each tree as the canopy was unable to be accessed from the ground. During each survey, a 1.5 m long pole (as described in avocado survey method 1) was held with the base at a vertical height of 0.5 m above the ground (as determined by string attached to the pole base). The pole was also equipped with a perpendicular horizontal wooden pole of length 0.75 m. This was used as a guide to restrict insect counts on racemes to the area between the outer canopy and 0.75 m within the canopy. This was necessary as racemes could be hidden deeper within the foliage of the canopy and difficult to observe directly. In some cases where the base of the foliage had been pruned approximately 1 m above the ground, it was necessary to hold the pole base at a higher point in the foliage to ensure the area containing flowering racemes remained equivalent to other orchards. The observer then slowly walked around the entire circumference of each tree counting flower-visiting insects at a distance within 30 cm. Care was taken to avoid the pole brushing the foliage that potentially could disturb flower visitors. Where a particular flower-visitor was particularly abundant, a hand-held counter was used to count numbers.</p></sec><sec id="s5a5" hwp:id="sec-61"><title hwp:id="title-62">Recording flower visitors</title><p hwp:id="p-85">Flower visitors were recorded on a paper spreadsheet to species if possible.
