In order to organize behavior and allocate effort so that optimal behavioral policies can be selected, it is necessary to continually monitor ongoing actions. Real-time processing of information related to actions and outcomes is typically assigned to the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, but also depends on midbrain regions, especially the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We were interested in how individual VTA neurons, as well as networks within the VTA, encode salient events when an unpredictable number of serial actions are required to obtain a reward. We recorded from ensembles of putative dopamine and non-dopamine neurons in the VTA as animals performed multiple cued trials in a recording session where, in each trial, serial actions were randomly rewarded. While averaging population activity did not reveal a response pattern, we observed that different neurons selectively tuned to low, medium, or high numbered actions in a trial. This preferential tuning of putative dopamine and non-dopamine VTA neurons to different subsets of actions in a trial allowed information about binned action number to be decoded from the ensemble activity. At the network level, tuning curve similarity was positively associated with action-evoked noise correlations, suggesting that action number selectivity reflects functional connectivity within these networks. Analysis of phasic responses to cue and reward revealed that the requirement to execute multiple and uncertain numbers of actions weakens both cue-evoked responses and cue-reward response correlation. The functional connectivity and ensemble coding scheme that we observe here may allow VTA neurons to cooperatively provide a real-time account of ongoing behavior. These computations may be critical to cognitive and motivational functions that have long been associated with VTA dopamine neurons.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="44"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

This function is typically assigned to the prefrontal cortex and striatum, but several lines of evidence demonstrate that organization of a series of behaviors also depends on VTA dopamine input to these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">Goldman-Rakic, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">Robbins and Arnsten, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44" hwp:id="xref-ref-44-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-44">Salamone et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, lesions of VTA dopamine projections to the striatum, or antagonists of dopamine receptors, impair the capacity to perform large numbers of actions without impacting the ability to complete one (or a few) action(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">Aberman and Salamone, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Ishiwari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">Mingote et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, VTA neurons are implicated in several cognitive constructs necessary for organizing an ongoing series of behaviors, such as working memory, attention, effort, and cognitive flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42" hwp:id="xref-ref-42-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-42">Salamone and Correa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">Seamans and Yang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">Robbins and Arnsten, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Fujisawa and Buzsaki, 2011</xref>). Thus, VTA neurons are critical for organizing, sustaining, and adapting an ongoing sequence of behaviors.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">Additional evidence that VTA neurons participate in structuring and organizing a behavioral series is provided by studies showing that dopamine release in nucleus accumbens precedes a series of two lever presses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56" hwp:id="xref-ref-56-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-56">Wassum et al., 2012</xref>), and dopamine neurons encode the first and last actions in a fixed response eight (FR8) reinforcement schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>). These response patterns, however, do not reveal how VTA neurons encode information <italic toggle="yes">during</italic> a series of actions. The expansive literature on dopamine signaling has mostly used tasks that require subjects to execute a single instrumental action, or Pavlovian tasks with no explicit action requirement. These experiments have generally focused on neuronal responses before behavior is initiated or after outcomes are delivered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">Ljungberg et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">Schultz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">Montague et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">Schultz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Bayer and Glimcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">Morris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">Roesch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43" hwp:id="xref-ref-43-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-43">Salamone et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">Dayan and Niv, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Glimcher, 2011</xref>). Thus, little is known about how VTA neurons encode information that could be used to organize and sustain a series of actions.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">To begin to understand how VTA neurons monitor a series of actions in real-time, we recorded from VTA ensembles during a task where rats executed an unpredictable number of self-paced actions to earn reward. We found that individual dopamine and non-dopamine neurons fired selectively during different actions in a trial. Whereas population-averaging concealed this mosaic of activity patterns, it was possible to decode low, medium, and high numbered actions within a trial from the collective activity of all neurons. These data provide novel evidence of ensemble encoding by VTA neurons and provide critical insight into how VTA neurons may contribute to complex behaviors by encoding real-time information about ongoing actions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">Subjects and Apparatus</title><p hwp:id="p-6">All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health’s Guide to the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and approved by the University of Pittsburgh’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Behavioral and neuronal data were collected from 10 adult, experimentally naïve, male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Frederick, MD) singly housed on a 12-hour light cycle (lights on at 7pm). These sample sizes were chosen because they are sufficient to detect behavioral and VTA neuronal effects in a variety of rat operant procedures in our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). At the time of surgery, rats weighed approximately 350 grams (approximately 12 weeks of age). Under isoflurane anesthesia, 8 or 16 channel, 50 μm stainless steel, Teflon insulated, microelectrode arrays were implanted in left VTA (relative to Bregma: -5.30 mm posterior, 0.8 mm lateral, and 8.3 mm ventral). All experiments were conducted in a standard operant chamber (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA). The operant chamber had a food trough on one wall and a single nose poke port on the opposite wall. Both the food trough and nose poke port could be illuminated and were equipped with an infrared beam, which detected the animal’s entry. The operant chamber system controller was configured to send the time of behavioral and environmental events to the recording interface via standard TTL pulses and a digital interface.</p></sec><sec id="s2b" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-5">Behavior</title><p hwp:id="p-7">Each rat was given 7 days to recover from surgery and food restricted to 90% of their free feeding body weights. Rats were habituated to handling for 5 minutes per day for 3 consecutive days, before being habituated to being handled and connected to a headstage cable in the procedure room for 2 additional days. Following habituation, rats were given a single 30 minute magazine training session in the operant chamber, in which sugar pellets were delivered on a variable time 75s reinforcement schedule. When each pellet was delivered, the pellet trough was illuminated for 4s. The animal’s behavior had no programmed consequences in the magazine training session.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Following the magazine training session, each animal began instrumental conditioning. During all instrumental conditioning sessions, each trial began with illumination of the nose poke port (cue light onset). This served as a discriminative stimulus that reinforcing outcomes (sugar pellets) were available (termed the ‘response period’), contingent upon the animal executing actions (nose pokes into the lit port). In each trial, actions were reinforced randomly, according to a predetermined probability. When an action was executed, the behavioral system controller randomly drew an outcome state (either reinforcement or no programmed consequence) with replacement, according to the probability of reinforcement. Each action was reinforced randomly and independently of the animal’s action history within that trial or session. When an action was reinforced, the cue light was immediately extinguished (cue light offset) and nose pokes had no additional programmed consequences. A 0.500s delay between the final action and outcome delivery was instituted to temporally separate these events, as done in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">Schultz et al., 1993</xref>). Following this delay, the outcome was delivered to the animal and the food trough was illuminated. Outcomes were delivered into the food trough from a standard pellet magazine, via the operation of a smaller stepper motor and dispenser. The food trough remained illuminated and the task did not progress until the animal retrieved the outcome. Once the animal retrieved the outcome, a variable length intertrial interval (ITI) of 10-12s was initiated. In each session, 180 trials were administered.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">In the first instrumental conditioning session, actions were reinforced with a probability of 1 (each action was reinforced) equivalent to a fixed ratio 1 (FR01) reinforcement schedule. In the second session, the probability that an action was reinforced was decreased across three blocks of trials. In the first block of 60 trials, actions were reinforced with a probability of 1 (FR01). In the second block of 60 trials, each action had a 1 in 3 chance of being reinforced (random ration 3, RR03). In the third block of 60 trials, the probability was further decreased to 0.2 (random ratio 5, RR05). In sessions 3 and 4, actions were reinforced with a 0.2 probability for all trials (RR05). In sessions 5-7, actions were reinforced with a probability of 0.1 for all trials (random ratio 10, RR10). In all trials but the FR01 trials, animals were required to execute an unpredictable, varying, and randomly determined number of actions per trial. Random reinforcement was utilized to limit the ability of the animal to correctly anticipate reward delivery. Actions differed from each other mainly in terms of their location within the action series in each trial (the action number within a trial, e.g. 1st action, 2nd action, 3rd action, etc.). In each trial, each animal’s action rate was calculated as the number of actions divided by the duration of the response period. This served as a measure of behavioral conditioning and performance. Changes in behavior across sessions were assessed with repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), and repeated measures contrasts were applied as appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">Kass et al., 2014</xref>). The time interval between each action (inter-action interval) was measured for bins of low, medium, and high numbered actions (actions 1-7, 8-14, and 15-21). Statistical differences between binned inter-action intervals were assessed with repeated measures ANOVA. This measured the animal’s behavioral sensitivity to increasing action numbers throughout a trial. To examine the effects of the number of actions performed in a trial on fatigue, motivation, or attention, the number of actions performed in each trial was correlated with the latency to retrieve the reward, or initiate the next trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2c" hwp:id="sec-5"><title hwp:id="title-6">Histology</title><p hwp:id="p-10">Following the completion of experiments, animals were perfused with saline and brains were extracted.

Neural data were recorded via the PlexControl software package, operating a 64-channel OmniPlex recording system (Plexon, Dallas, TX). Neural data were buffered by a unity gain headstage and then a preamplifier. The digitized broadband signal was then band-pass filtered (100 Hz – 7 KHz). High-pass filtering can affect spike waveform shapes and neuronal identification, but with freely moving animals it is necessary to apply these filters to remove artifacts from the neuronal signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55" hwp:id="xref-ref-55-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-55">Ungless and Grace, 2012</xref>). The filter pass bands that were utilized in the current manuscript are consistent with those that have previously been used to record from dopamine containing brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">Schultz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">Fiorillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52" hwp:id="xref-ref-52-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-52">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>).

It should be pointed out, however, that indirect identification (using electrophysiological features as opposed genotypic features) can lead to classification errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">Margolis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). In general, qualitatively similar responses were observed in both groups of neurons. Units recorded in different sessions were considered separate units, as methods to estimate neuronal identity between sessions are not widely used with VTA recordings. In total, the following numbers of neurons were recorded in each of 7 sessions: dopamine (reward responsive): 11(7), 19(10), 21(12), 29(19), 27(13), 21(9), 27(16); nondopamine (reward responsive): 31(17), 35(14), 39(27), 34(13), 25(12), 29(11), 27(9).</p></sec><sec id="s2e" hwp:id="sec-7"><title hwp:id="title-8">Neuronal Data Analysis</title><p hwp:id="p-13">Each single unit’s spike times were binned into spike counts (0.025s bins) within a trial. Binned spike counts were aligned to all events (e.g. cue light onset, actions, time period between cue light offset and outcome delivery, and outcome delivery). A stable, four s portion of the ITI (5s to 1s prior to cue light onset) served as the neuronal activity baseline. Single unit firing rates were Z-score normalized relative to baseline and zero-centered before activity was averaged together. Each unit’s normalized activity was examined in 0.250s windows around events (cue onset: +0.050 – 0.300s, relative to cue onset; -0.125 – +0.125s, relative to the time of action execution; time period between cue offset and outcome delivery: +0.150 – 0.400s, relative to execution of the last action; outcome delivery: +0.050 – 0.300s, relative to delivery). To assess between-session changes in population-level evoked activity, windowed activity was compared with a between groups two way ANOVA, with session number and neuron type (dopamine or non-dopamine) as grouping variables. In all cases, protected Fisher’s least significant difference tests were applied as appropriate.</p><p hwp:id="p-14">A unit was classified as being activated or suppressed by an event if it met two criteria: 1) a significant paired samples t-test comparing raw (non-normalized) baseline firing rates with raw evoked firing rates, and 2) three or more consecutive bins of mean activity within the event-window, that were in excess of a 95% confidence interval around the baseline mean. With respect to a given task event, the proportions of units classified as being activated or suppressed were calculated. Differences in the proportions of activated units between sessions were compared with a Chi-squared test of independence. As expected, insufficient numbers of suppressed neurons (in some sessions zero) were obtained to permit reliable statistical analyses of this class of responses. Suppressed neurons are plotted for clarity, but not analyzed in detail.</p><p hwp:id="p-15">The terminology “action-evoked” neuronal responses refers to activity around the time of action execution, without assuming that the action is solely responsible for evoking this neuronal response. Each unit’s activity was examined as a function of action number (a unit’s mean response to each n<sup>th</sup> numbered action within a trial, across all trials). These analyses were restricted to the RR10 sessions (sessions 5-7). RR10 sessions required larger numbers of actions per trial, on average, and would ensure that there were a sufficient number of higher numbered actions (e.g. actions 18, 19, 20, 21, etc.) for analysis. All action number analyses utilized actions 1 through 21. While even higher numbered actions occurred in some trials, these actions occurred less frequently and were excluded from action number analyses, as there was insufficient sample size for reliable statistical analysis. To remove any effects of impending reward delivery on the action evoked neuronal responses, only unrewarded actions were used in this analysis. Preliminary analyses suggested that including rewarded actions had little effect on the results. Action evoked neuronal responses were binned into 3 bins of 7 consecutive actions representing low, medium, and high numbered actions (actions 1-7, 8-14, and 15-21, respectively).</p><p hwp:id="p-16">We measured correlations in spike count between pairs of dopamine neurons (n = 172), pairs of non-dopaminergic neurons (n = 276), and mixed pairs (a dopamine and a non-dopamine neuron, n = 387) in RR10 sessions.

Pairwise neuronal correlations were assessed in the same .250 sec windows used to quantify firing rates, using the standard Pearson’s correlation,

The percentages of neurons with significant coefficients are reported. To visualize the various tunings of VTA neurons to action number, each neuron’s mean activity as a function of action number is displayed. Because evoked firing rates could span a large range of values, each tuning curve scaled so that the maximum evoked activity was equal to 1 and the minimum evoked activity was equal to 0. Scaled tuning curves were used only for visualization. To compute the number of maxima, each tuning curve was fit with a cubic smoothing spline (smoothing parameter 0.001) and maxima were detected as points in the spline with derivatives equal to 0.</p></sec><sec id="s2f" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-9">Population Average Decoder</title><p hwp:id="p-18">A decoder classified binned action number according to the trial-averaged spike count, also averaged across neurons, on an action-by-action basis.

Dopamine and non-dopamine VTA neurons were preferentially tuned to different subsets of binned action number in a manner that allowed serial actions to be accurately discriminated from the collective activity of VTA ensembles. In addition, pairs of neurons with similar action tuning curves had higher action-evoked noise correlations suggesting that VTA network properties may be critical to information processing during serial actions. Our analyses further showed that this pattern of tuning is distinct from reward prediction related activity or the passage of time. We also demonstrated that cues preceding a series of actions, unlike a single rewarded action, do not evoke neuronal responses and are decoupled from reward, suggesting that cue-related information is utilized differently when a single versus an unpredictable series of actions are required to obtain reward.</p><sec id="s4a" hwp:id="sec-21"><title hwp:id="title-32">Encoding information during an action series</title><p hwp:id="p-43">Previous reports indicate that dopamine neurons encode errors in the predicted value of rewards as well as action values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">Montague et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">Schultz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">Morris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">Roesch et al., 2007</xref>).

VTA dopamine neurons project to several networks that may utilize this signal to organize behavior. For instance, dopamine innervation of the ventral striatum is selectively required for completing a lengthy series of instrumental actions, but not for executing small numbers of actions for reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">Aberman and Salamone, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Ishiwari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">Mingote et al., 2005</xref>). Dopamine projections to the prefrontal cortex are important for working memory and related constructs that require real-time information about ongoing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Goldman-Rakic, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">Seamans and Yang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">Robbins and Roberts, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">Robbins and Arnsten, 2009</xref>). VTA neurons could contribute to these functions by continually encoding information throughout execution of a lengthy series of actions, allowing striatal and prefrontal networks to track goal-directed effort expenditure and progress.</p><p hwp:id="p-45">Our analyses suggest that VTA responses do not represent the passage of time in the current task. Although dopamine responses are sensitive to the timing of reward delivery and necessary for perception of time and interval timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">Lake and Meck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Bermudez and Schultz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">Parker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50" hwp:id="xref-ref-50-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-50">Soares et al., 2016</xref>), neuronal responses were not consistently modulated by time elapsed in a trial. Instead, activity during a series of actions was most strongly modulated by action execution. This is likely because reward delivery was not contingent upon elapsed time, and VTA neurons are sensitive to the contingency between action execution and outcome delivery. Experimental designs with an explicit contingency between elapsed time and reward delivery, such as a fixed interval reward schedule, may reveal a more complex relationship between action execution and within trial timing in the responses of VTA neurons.</p><p hwp:id="p-46">We also found that the number of actions required in RR10 trials did not modulate VTA responses to the rewarded action or the first action in the next trial. This suggests that recent trial history does not affect action evoked responses at the beginning or end of a series of actions. Similarly, VTA responses to stimuli associated with reward were not consistently correlated with the number of actions that an animal performed, suggesting that VTA correlates of reward anticipation did not increase or decrease according to action number. This result was expected, as each action was reinforced with equal probability.</p></sec><sec id="s4b" hwp:id="sec-22"><title hwp:id="title-33">VTA ensemble encoding</title><p hwp:id="p-47">Neurons with similar action number tuning curves had higher action-evoked noise correlations in spike count, which reflect shared connectivity between neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</xref>). This suggests that different action number tunings may arise from unique inputs or differing connection strengths between inputs and VTA neurons with similar tunings may share connection properties.

Networks can encode information redundantly or through diverse activity patterns and heterogeneous tunings naturally lead to the capacity to encode information as ensembles. Accordingly, serial actions were accurately discriminated from ensemble activity, but not from population-averaged activity. Though previous studies suggest VTA activity is highly redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">Joshua et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46" hwp:id="xref-ref-46-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-46">Schultz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Glimcher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">Eshel et al., 2016</xref>), this work was limited to tasks requiring very few actions.

Thus, ensemble encoding of information may occur when the complexity of a task increases, such as during ongoing serial actions.</p><p hwp:id="p-49">Units classified as either putative dopamine or non-dopamine neurons had comparable mixed tunings to serial actions, suggesting that dopamine neurons can cooperate with nondopamine VTA neurons to encode information about serial actions. These ensemble signals consisting of multiple neurotransmitters could allow information to be decoded through multiple signaling mechanisms, which may diversify the spatiotemporal properties of this signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">Seamans and Yang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">Barker et al., 2016</xref>).

There was also a significant correlation between cue and reward delivery evoked responses. These observations are consistent with a convincing body of literature suggesting that dopamine neurons encode action value predicted by cues in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">Montague et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">Dayan and Abbott, 2001</xref>). On the other hand, when animals were required to execute multiple and random numbers of actions (random reinforcement schedules) to earn rewards we observed weakening of two critical neuronal responses by VTA neurons: (1)-loss of cue-evoked responses and (2) decorrelation of cue and reward evoked responses. This suggests that VTA neuronal responses to reward predictive cues are modulated by the contingency and/or contiguity between cues, action, and outcomes. When cues or discriminative stimuli are presented in FR01 trials, there is often a close temporal association between cue and reward delivery, as animals tend to execute actions within several seconds to earn rewards. As only one action is required in this setting, there may be a more accurate predictive relationship between cue onset and reward delivery. Thus, the unpredictable nature of a random reinforcement schedule may prevent the cue from evoking a reward prediction error. This finding is important because while previous studies have suggested that cue-evoke reward prediction errors can be used to guide action selection in a wide variety of settings, these data are drawn largely from Pavlovian and FR01-based tasks.</p><p hwp:id="p-51">Cue offset in the current task is similar to a traditional Pavlovian conditioned stimulus, as offset was completely predictive of subsequent reward delivery with high temporal contiguity (0.5 sec between offset and delivery). Consistent with previous studies in which Pavlovian associations evoke VTA responses after associations are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45" hwp:id="xref-ref-45-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-45">Schultz, 1998</xref>), responses evoked by cue offset grew larger in successive sessions of the task. Our experiment was not designed to dissociate the effects of learning from the effects of different reinforcement schedules on information processing, and future experiments can directly address this topic. Taken together, these data suggest VTA neurons encode real-time information about ongoing actions in conjunction with information about cues with strong contiguity and contingency with reward delivery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-24"><title hwp:id="title-35">Conclusions</title><p hwp:id="p-52">Our date reveal a novel form of information processing by VTA neurons.
