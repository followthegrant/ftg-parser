In fields that develop axiomatically, the conceptual basis can be easily identified in the set of axioms guiding model building. However, ecology does not develop axiomatically but rather pragmatically, i.e., ecologists do not build models based on a predefined set of assumptions (axioms). They rather resort to any information that seems useful to learn about ecological phenomena. Therefore, a theoretical synthesis in ecology cannot rely on the enunciation of axioms; instead, it requires identifying what information and knowledge ecologists use (i.e., what they decide is useful to learn). Here we present an approach for producing theoretical syntheses based on the information/knowledge most frequently used to learn about the world. The approach consists of (i) defining a phenomenon of interest; (ii) defining a collective of scientists studying the phenomenon; (iii) surveying the scientific studies about the phenomenon published by this collective; (iv) identifying the most relevant publications used in these studies; (v) identifying how the studies refer to the most relevant publications; (vi) synthesizing what is being used by this collective to learn about the phenomenon. We implemented the approach in a case study on the phenomenon of ecological succession, defining the collective as the scientists currently studying succession. We identified three propositions that synthesize the views of the defined collective about succession. The theoretical synthesis revealed that there is no clear division between “classical” and “contemporary” succession models, and that neutral models are being used to explain successional patterns alongside with models based on niche assumptions.By implementing the pragmatic approach in a case study, we show that it can be successfully used to produce syntheses describing the conceptual bases of a field, which have the potential to guide knowledge generation. As such, these syntheses fulfil the roles ascribed to scientific theories in the epistemological literature.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="21"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta hwp:id="custom-meta-1"><meta-name>special-property</meta-name><meta-value>contains-inline-supplementary-material</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta-wrap>

However, the conceptual bases of knowledge generation in ecology might not be so easy to identify. The discussions about theory in ecology led to no clearly agreed conceptual bases unifying all scientific activity in this science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>] and attempts to synthesize ecological theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>] were not generally taken into account in subsequent work (as one would expect from syntheses meant to describe and guide knowledge generation in a field). Regardless of this lack of consensus and reference to theoretical syntheses, ecology has undergone intense development as a science for more than a century of history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>]. Hence, what is guiding the development of ecology and how can we make meaningful theoretical syntheses in this field?</p><p hwp:id="p-6">The traditional format of a theoretical synthesis is based on the enunciation of axioms — statements assumed to be self-evident in a specific context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>] — followed by immediate theorems — deductions from these axioms that can be used to both support the truth of the axioms and make predictions about the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>]. This kind of synthesis is aligned with axiomatic views of how a theory describes and explains phenomena and guides knowledge generation. In the most recent understandings of axiomatic views, if theorems deduced from the axioms represent accurately a phenomenon, this theorem will be regarded as a model of the theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. If a phenomenon is adequately represented by the model and, therefore, behaves like the model, the axioms from which the models were deduced can be regarded as true of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>]. Therefore, a synthesis enunciating a set of axioms and how they can be combined to generate new models will be very useful to describe the conceptual basis of a field of study and should help guide scientific activity by clearly enunciating the accepted rules to build new models. In the natural sciences, the axioms of a successful theory are presented as laws of nature, which sometimes are viewed as exceptionless rules according to which nature behaves and sometimes as general rules that help us identify major tendencies in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>]. Either way, if these laws are assumed as true and models to learn about the world are deduced from them, these laws will be working as axioms of a theory. The adoption of such views of theory might explain why some authors interested in making theoretical syntheses in ecology are also interested in the existence and identification of laws in this science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>]. However, there are views of theory that do not assume that models used to learn about phenomena are, or at least should be, deduced from axioms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-7">In Travassos-Britto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>], we proposed that knowledge generation in ecology is often not axiomatic but rather pragmatic. Under the pragmatic view of theories, scientific research involves using models to learn about phenomena, but there is no concern in following a set of rules enunciated in axioms. Rather, models are built freely by resorting to any knowledge available to the modeler such as previously proposed models, propositions, methods, definitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>]. There are many different criteria for a model to be considered useful, including cognitive criteria (e.g., predictive efficacy, explanatory success, increased understanding, adequacy-for-purpose) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref>] and social criteria (e.g., prominence of its proponents) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref>]. The final decision on which model is useful and which is not is made by the agents (in this case, practicing ecologists) when carrying out their studies. As a consequence, the set of models used to learn about a phenomenon in a field of study is defined by the decisions of a collective of agents trying to learn about the phenomenon, not by their deductive relations with axioms. In this scenario, a theoretical synthesis based on the collective decisions of a community should better reflect the conceptual bases of a field of study than a set of axioms and deduced theorems. In this scenario, the question that remains is how to access the decisions of such a collective.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Scientists report their research mostly in written articles where they make propositions about how the world is [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>]. Propositions made in past studies are often referred to in subsequent studies to inform readers of which views about the world the research is based upon. Therefore, by accessing the article reporting a scientific study it is possible to trace which propositions are being used as conceptual basis for that study and how they are being used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>]. The same applies for a collective of scientists studying a phenomenon. By accessing the articles describing the scientific studies of a collective, one can discover which and how propositions are being used as conceptual bases to learn about the world from the point of view of that collective. Propositions about the world that are frequently referred to by a scientific community may reveal, among other things, that some propositions seem particularly relevant to learn about the phenomenon and other propositions do not.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Here, we propose a methodological approach to identify and describe the most referred propositions in the scientific research intended to learn more about a certain phenomenon. We provide an example of the implementation of the approach used to identify the current conceptual bases of the studies about ecological succession and describe the specific methodological decisions we made to implement each step as well as the results obtained. We end up by discussing in what way our proposed approach to produce a theoretical synthesis is different from other approaches and how syntheses produced by using our approach can fulfill the role of a clearly enunciated theory.</p><sec id="s1a" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-5">The Pragmatic Approach to Theories</title><p hwp:id="p-10">The notion that models validity corresponds to how much a model is used in a given context is based on the pragmatic view of scientific theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. Therefore, we dubbed our approach Pragmatic Approach to Theories (PATh). We outlined PATh as a set of steps that can be executed by adopting different methods.

The result of this step is a set of statements that synthesize the main contributions of the relevant publications used by the collective to learn about the phenomenon.</p><p hwp:id="p-19">The approach assumes that science works as a decentralized system of information exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref>]. This system has been described in many ways, e.g., as cycles of normal science followed by paradigm shifts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">28</xref>], as heterogeneous networks of actors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref>], or as distributed cognitive systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref>]. Our approach is agnostic on the details of the dynamics of scientific information exchange systems, provided that such dynamics includes the use of models (as defined above).</p><p hwp:id="p-20">The steps included in PATh were thought to give access to the activities of the collective of agents studying a phenomenon while dealing with issues associated with assuming that this decentralized system of information exchange can be traced in the network of citations among publications. The first issue with that assumption is that among the publications that are cited in a network of citations there is a continuum that goes from the most cited to the least cited ones. Therefore, there needs to be cut-off criteria to define what is a relevant publication and what is not. A second issue is that the citation index alone does not necessarily reflect theoretical links between citing and cited publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to differentiate citations that reveal theoretical links from other types of citations. The third issue is that even when a publication is cited due to its theoretical relevance in a field of study, it is most likely that only a particular part of it is being considered relevant and not all the propositions contained in it. Therefore, it is necessary to identify what part of the relevant publications is actually being referred to by the studies being carried out by the collective.</p><p hwp:id="p-21">The steps (iv), (v) and (vi) were designed to deal with these issues and in doing so they differentiate this approach from a simple analysis based on a systematic search. In these steps, one should define criteria to reach a finite set of relevant publications, to differentiate theoretically relevant citations from non-relevant ones, and to identify what the collective of agents is actually referring to in the relevant publications. In the following section we will describe specifically how we implemented each step, taking ecological succession as a case study.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-9"><title hwp:id="title-13">Methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-10"><title hwp:id="title-14">Defining the phenomenon of interest</title><p hwp:id="p-22">We have chosen succession as a case study because it is a phenomenon that is referred to by a single term (“succession” itself), with a small degree of ambiguity or polysemy, compared to other ecological concepts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">32</xref>].

This database was chosen because it has a set tools for systematic search as well as output files that can be promptly used to make citation network analyses (see next section). We used the keyword “successi*” in the “Topic” field of the search engine of the database, which searches for the term in title and abstracts, and filtered the publications that were in the “Ecology” category. We filtered the search for publications dated from January 2007 to July 2017.

The most cited publications in this smaller network were cited by only 6% of the 954 publications network. This result indicated that this fraction of 20% of the studies sampled at the previous step that does not cite the 100 most cited publications is not forming a divergent subcommunity that has an alternative cohesive view about succession. Most likely, these publications are individually referring to lesser-known models in the field of study without any convergence among them. Although we may technically consider these 20% as part of the collective of agents studying succession, we cannot guarantee that their views about succession are contemplated by the 25 relevant publications selected, since they did not cite any of them.

This analysis was carried out by asking the graduate students and researchers in ecology (thereafter ‘ecologists’) to propose what are the main statements made in the relevant publications by only reading the excerpts of citation text. We used this approach due to the understanding that the interpretation of a single person creating such a synthesis might introduce biases in the final result. To deal with this issue, we used an approach relying on intersubjectivity as a key characteristic of the social processes of building scientific knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62" hwp:id="xref-ref-62-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-62">62</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-36">For each set of 50 excerpts citing each relevant publication, the participants were then asked to synthesize these statements in a concise, self-consistent set of propositions about the ecological phenomenon at stake. These sets were taken as the models from each relevant publication in use by the research collective in order to learn about succession.</p><p hwp:id="p-37">The main characteristic of this approach is that more than one individual synthesized the models from the same excerpts and their results were compared in order to reach a consensus. Each set of 50 excerpts of text citing a single relevant publication was presented to three different ecologists, who formed a trio. Each trio was responsible for a set of three different relevant publications and synthesized the main contribution(s) of each. Therefore, to execute the synthesis using all 25 relevant publications we counted with the aid of 25 participants. All the 25 participants had a degree in biology, among which eight had a PhD in ecology (two professors and six post-doctoral fellows of the department of ecology in the university where the study was carried out) and 17 were graduate students (six PhD candidates, and 11 master’s degree candidates in ecology from the same university). The participants had different levels of familiarity with the set of relevant publications, ranging from knowing, citing, discussing and teaching about the publication to no familiarity at all. Nevertheless, at the moment of the analysis, the participants were not informed about what publication the set of excerpts of text were referring to (the actual citations in the excerpts of text were replaced by a “[Relevant Publication]” tag, in order to inform where in the sentence the relevant publication was referred to).</p><p hwp:id="p-38">Even though we excluded the publications that were obviously cited by some statistical support, the participants in the content analysis could find citations that did not establish a conceptual link between relevant publication and the citing study. The citation might be just referring to a tool or method (in which case it was named ‘operational’), it might not be used to structure an argument (‘perfunctory’), or it might be used as an example of something wrong (‘negational’) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>]. The participants in our study were asked to disregard citations that were considered by them as operational, perfunctory or negational. Some of these three excluded categories of citation could help to identify the main contribution of a relevant publication. However, if a proposition is frequently cited in a domain, for example, in a negational way, it is unlikely that it is being used as a conceptual basis to create a model to learn about the phenomenon of interest.</p><p hwp:id="p-39">After each participant of a trio had synthesized textually what they thought to be the model or models in use from each relevant publication, the three syntheses were combined in a consensus activity adapted from the “Nominal Group Technique (NGT)” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63" hwp:id="xref-ref-63-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-63">63</xref>]. The goal of this activity was to synthesize a verbal model or set of models that the three participants agreed upon as being what the citations of a relevant publication were referring to (see S2 Appendix for methodological details of this step). For the 25 relevant publications, 29 textual models about the natural world were identified.

The relative importance of these mechanisms may vary over time due to changes in environmental conditions. The general functioning of these mechanisms is of a priority effect: the chances of colonization of a site by a species are affected by the species that colonized before this site.

Through PATh we were able to identify 29 verbal models about succession that were frequently and widely referred to in studies about ecological succession in the past decade. We can call them the “central models”. The reason why each of these models is frequently referred to while attempting to learn about ecological succession may reveal much about the theory of this collective of scientists about this phenomenon. The conclusions we drew from analyzing the set of models in use should illustrate the kind of information one can obtain by using PATh to produce a theoretical synthesis.</p><sec id="s3a" hwp:id="sec-17"><title hwp:id="title-22">Defining ecological succession</title><p hwp:id="p-43">The models we identified make different statements about what ecological succession is and focus on different properties of the phenomenon. We are not interested, however, in particular views within the domain, but in how we can define the phenomenon of succession in a way that encompasses any of the models retrieved by PATh. To do so we analyzed a single description of succession coming from one of the central models and tried to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for succession to occur, according to this description. Then, we analyzed a second model and checked if the conditions identified for the first description of succession were also necessary and sufficient for succession as described in the second central model. If not, we tried to describe the conditions in more general terms in a way they could also be considered necessary and sufficient for succession as described in the second central model. If this was not possible, we discarded that condition as being too specific for the general description of succession. We did this until all descriptions of succession found in the central models were analyzed. We reached two propositions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>] that informed the conditions that seemed necessary and sufficient for any phenomenon of succession described in the set of central models to occur. However, some of the central models describe ecological processes that are different in many aspects. We then analyzed what was the primordial cause of the differences among these processes and conceived a third proposition that can explain why succession is such a diverse phenomenon, which may manifest in different ways.</p><p hwp:id="p-44">The propositions expressing the necessary and sufficient conditions for delimiting the phenomenon of succession, as viewed in the set of models identified through PATh, are:</p><statement hwp:id="statement-1"><label>Proposition 1:</label><p hwp:id="p-45">At every moment in time, there is the possibility that resources will be available for use.</p></statement><statement hwp:id="statement-2"><label>Proposition 2:</label><p hwp:id="p-46">Organisms from different species or at different ontogenetic stages have different probabilities of taking a fraction of the total available resource units.

Even though the central models themselves may not have been conceived with these propositions explicitly in sight, our analyses show retrospectively that they underlie the construction of models within this field of study and, also, that by adopting them as true one could have conceived these models. Therefore, these propositions can be seen as fundamental principles of the domain. This means that any model that assumes these propositions as true is akin to the identified models and should be considered as a model within the domain of ecological succession as delimited by us. This information is not only useful to understand the field of study in which PATh was applied. It helps ecologists decide if their phenomenon of study is succession or not, according to the focal collective considered in this study. This clarity can be used to avoid spurious debate, and can also reveal more straightforward ways to propose changes to how we conceive the phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="s3b" hwp:id="sec-18"><title hwp:id="title-23">Neutral models in succession theory</title><p hwp:id="p-49">Five of the 29 identified models did not include the word “succession” in their description.

In the same vein, the two other models that did not mention succession explicitly were the models of Island Biogeography and the Neutral Theory, which describe the role of colonization and extinction in community assembly in general (Models 14 and 19, described by MacArthur and Wilson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">47</xref>]; and Hubbell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52" hwp:id="xref-ref-52-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-52">52</xref>].

An overview of the citing excerpts reveals that the neutral model is frequently used to explain successional patterns at landscape or global scales, meaning that this model is actually being used to learn about succession. Similarly, the model of island biogeography is frequently used to explain why different patterns of succession emerge in fragments at varying distances from other fragments (see S3 Appendix).

This paper is frequently cited in order to support the idea that succession is the change in ecosystem properties through time. Hence, there can be little doubt that the scientific collective studying succession still adopts supra-individual approaches to this phenomenon as a possible way to understand it. Similarly, the model proposed by Guariguata and Ostertag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61" hwp:id="xref-ref-61-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-61">61</xref>] is used to give support to the claim that succession can be viewed as changes in functional groups, which are also supra-individual entities.</p><p hwp:id="p-54">In the classical view, succession has been considered a dynamic intrinsic to communities of primary producers, while in the contemporary view succession it is considered a dynamic of communities at any trophic levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68" hwp:id="xref-ref-68-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-68">68</xref>]. What our findings show is that the most referred models in this field are still about succession of plant communities. Most models are explicit about it and only a few propose mechanisms that could be applied to heterotrophic organisms. Therefore, it seems that succession ecology is still focused on plants and if there is a change towards a more multitrophic understanding of succession, this change is yet not noticeable enough to have surfaced with the most referred models.</p><p hwp:id="p-55">In synthesis, some models classified as belonging to the “classical view” have been still used often as a conceptual basis for learning more about succession in the last decade, while some others classified as belonging to the “contemporary view” have not been so frequently used. This result leads to the question of whether this classification of concepts as belonging to classical and contemporary views on succession is indeed a description of how the collective understands the theoretical development of the field or is rather some sort of rational reconstruction found in textbooks that does not really correspond to the way the collective pragmatically uses models, or, yet, a prescription of how the field should be seen. These observations highlight some insights that PATh allowed us to reach, in this case concerning the theoretical structure of the succession domain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-20"><title hwp:id="title-25">Discussion</title><p hwp:id="p-56">We showed that PATh allows for a theoretical synthesis that assesses the conceptual bases of a field of study by describing the views of a defined community about an ecological phenomenon. Therefore, such a synthesis does fulfill one of the roles of a scientific theory, namely, the description of conceptual bases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>]. However, the way in which PATh allows for such a synthesis gives it some distinctive characteristics.</p><p hwp:id="p-57">The first distinctive feature is that a synthesis made by PATh has an explicitly descriptive character, in the sense that this synthesis intends to provide a summary description of how scientists are employing the knowledge available to them. This description arises, thus, from a pragmatic perspective on theories and models.</p><p hwp:id="p-58">Pickett, Meiners and Cadenasso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>] provided a literature overview and a general theoretical synthesis for ecological succession that can be compared with the one produced by using PATh. They also mention that this synthesis is to be used as a mechanistic reference in future studies of succession. They started from published papers to propose a synthesis around fundamental propositions about ecological succession and then described some central models in the field, just like we did. Some of their propositions are in accordance with the ones derived from PATh in some respects, but in disagreement with others. It is important to note, however, that their synthesis was made by using an “expert opinion” approach which is highly dependent on the proponents’ own views and in which it is not clear what procedures were carried out to reach the set of propositions and models. These procedures are important because without knowing them it is not possible to be critical about the results and methodological criticism is one of the cornerstones of the construction of scientific knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71" hwp:id="xref-ref-71-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-71">71</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-59">The main difference of using PATh to produce theoretical syntheses instead of expert opinion is that a detailed methodological description can be made to explain how propositions and models are directly linked to the actual scientific research made in a field. This process allows for a more direct and efficient process of criticism and re-evaluation of the synthesis. For example, one might argue that the third step was not conducted properly, resulting in a biased survey of the publications reflecting the activities of the focal collective of scientists. This could entail a set of relevant publications that do not contain conceptually important propositions about the phenomenon. This statement could then be tested, first, by evaluating if the parameters of the search may result in biased outcomes and then adjusting them to avoid the detected biases. Finally, we could check if the final set of central models obtained was in fact different from the one resulting from the previous search.</p><p hwp:id="p-60">The second distinctive characteristic of syntheses made with PATh is related to the assumption that a theory about a phenomenon can be seen as the views of a specific collective of scientists about a specific phenomenon or class of phenomena. This assumption implies that different collectives of scientists studying a phenomenon may have different theories about it. Because the definition of who is part of this collective is a methodological step in the PATh, multiple instances of the approach can be applied to different collectives and the theoretical syntheses resulting from these different instances can be compared (or, perhaps, even combined to reach a more overarching approach). For example, an application of the PATh to different time scopes can reveal how some change may have happened through disuse of models that were highly cited in the past and/or increase in the use of models that are new to the field. Scientific practices can also change from place to place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72" hwp:id="xref-ref-72-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73" hwp:id="xref-ref-73-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-73">73</xref>], as well as depending on gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74" hwp:id="xref-ref-74-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-74">74</xref>], age, academic position and other social and cultural characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75" hwp:id="xref-ref-75-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-75">75</xref>]. Different applications of PATh could be used to answer if these different time, geographic and demographic profiles could lead to different views about a specific phenomenon. These social aspects of scientific work have been neglected for many decades in the natural sciences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76" hwp:id="xref-ref-76-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-76">76</xref>], and the use of the PATh may offer, therefore, a tool for dealing with these aspects that may raise the interest of academics to consider them more closely.</p><p hwp:id="p-61">The syntheses allowed by the PATh are explicitly descriptive in the sense that the enunciation of the central models identified is not a recommendation of the best models to learn about the focal phenomenon. These models merely summarize the conceptual basis of research conducted in the field. That, however, does not preclude syntheses produced by the PATh to be used to guide scientific activity in the field, although in a non-axiomatic way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>]. For example, we detected that many scientists in the field of ecological succession accept that succession can be modelled as a supra-individualistic process, while others propose that succession be understood as an individualistic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33" hwp:id="xref-ref-33-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-33">33</xref>]. This conflict revealed by the produced synthesis can alert either side to the need to express their viewpoints more specifically, either by presenting evidence supporting the claim that we should abandon models assuming supra-individualistic views of succession or arguing why there is no reason for that. If this knowledge is not yet available, it might be the case to invest in research to resolve this dispute. Such conduct should help avoid spurious debates within the field and, as a consequence, make the field more efficient in generating knowledge about the phenomenon. Therefore, we can use the information obtained by accessing and analyzing the views of a collective of scientists about a phenomenon using the PATh to make more informed decisions about what needs to change and how it needs to change. This change is assumed to be an integral part of theory development.</p><p hwp:id="p-62">In the axiomatic view of theory, a scientist knows exactly the assumptions their models need to have in order to pertain to a given theory. If the model does not assume the axioms as true, it is not part of that theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>]. Therefore, a theory is an <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> static entity defined by a set of axioms. If there are grounds to believe that the axioms are not true of the world, the entire theory must be cast aside. A synthesis made by using the PATh will show, in turn, which are the central models under use in a field of study and, therefore, this theoretical synthesis is an <italic toggle="yes">a posteriori</italic> entity. This is a considerable change of perspective because there is more space to tinker with theories and models, merge them, reinterpret them, and so forth. If one assumes that the conceptual basis of a field is grounded on a collective view of a collective and that collective change, it will become practically a necessity to assume that theories are ever-changing entities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-21"><title hwp:id="title-26">Conclusion</title><p hwp:id="p-63">Ecologists have shown that they can produce knowledge about the world without the restraints and guidance of a single, axiomatic theory. Some even disrecommended pursuing systematization of knowledge into theories on the grounds that theories are reins that restrain scientific development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77" hwp:id="xref-ref-77-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-77">77</xref>]. Meanwhile, the number of studies proposing conceptual unification, disambiguation of concepts, conceptual cleaning and calls to training more theoreticians in ecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78" hwp:id="xref-ref-78-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82" hwp:id="xref-ref-82-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-82">82</xref>] indicates that there is a demand for some kind of systematized way to represent the knowledge generated in ecology. Here we presented an approach that could help ecologists create theoretical syntheses without the necessity of identifying axioms and fitting knowledge development into some predefined structure. These syntheses can be used to make more informed decisions about how to approach a phenomenon, for example, by deciding to investigate more thoroughly a model that is gaining attention quickly, by investing in propositions that are being neglected by a community or by advising against the use of models that have been shown to be flawed.</p><p hwp:id="p-64">To the extent that the relevance of models within a field can be gauged by how much they are used by a collective of scientists, the relevance of a theoretical synthesis can also be gauged by how much a collective of scientists uses it. If ecologists do in fact use the syntheses made by using the PATh to guide their scientific activities, these syntheses will fulfill both roles of a clearly enunciated theory, namely, describing and guiding knowledge generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, since these syntheses are made <italic toggle="yes">a posteriori</italic> their guidance will work much more like consulting maps than restraining reins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" hwp:id="sec-22"><title hwp:id="title-27">Supporting information</title><supplementary-material position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="DC1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">DC1</object-id><label>S1 Appendix</label><media xlink:href="supplements/344200_file04.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="media-1"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="DC2"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">DC2</object-id><label>S2 Appendix</label><media xlink:href="supplements/344200_file05.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="media-2"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="DC3"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">DC3</object-id><label>S3 Appendix</label><media xlink:href="supplements/344200_file06.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="media-3"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec hwp:id="sec-23"><title hwp:id="title-28">Supporting information</title><p hwp:id="p-65"><bold>S1 Appendix.
