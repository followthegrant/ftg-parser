Owing to the recent development of technologies for artificial DNA synthesis, it may become important in the near future to mathematically design minimum metabolic networks to simulate metabolite production. Accordingly, we have developed a computational method where parsimonious metabolic flux distribution is computed for designated constraints on growth and production rates which are represented by grids. When the growth rate of this obtained parsimonious metabolic network is maximized, higher production rates compared to those noted using existing methods are observed for many target metabolites. The set of reactions used in this parsimonious flux distribution consists of reactions included in the original genome scale model iAF1260. The computational experiments show that the grid size affects the obtained production rates. Under the conditions that the growth rate is maximized and the minimum cases of flux variability analysis are considered, the developed method produced more than 90% of metabolites, while the existing methods produced less than 50%. Mathematical explanations using examples are provided to demonstrate potential reasons for the ability of the proposed algorithm to identify design strategies that the existing methods could not identify.

By computationally modifying a given metabolic network of microbes, we can simulate the effect of knockouts and estimate the production of valuable metabolites. A common mathematical model of metabolic networks is the constraint-based flux model. In constraint-based flux balance analysis, a pseudo-steady state is assumed to predict the metabolic profile where the sum of all incoming fluxes is equal to the sum of all outgoing fluxes for each internal metabolite. Based on these constraints, the biomass objective function, written as a linear combination of fluxes, is maximized.

Because a significant amount of time and effort is required for knocking out several genes, a smaller number of knockouts is preferred in knockout strategies.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">However, the technologies for DNA synthesis are being improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>]. Although the ability to read DNA is still better than the ability to write DNA, designing synthetic DNA may become important in the near future for the production of metabolites instead of knocking out genes in the original genome. Furthermore, it is more reasonable to design DNA by utilizing already existing genes than to create new genes on a nucleotide level. One to one control relation between each gene and reaction may become possible by modifying existing genes. In contrast to knockout strategies, the number of genes included in the design of synthetic DNA should be as small as possible owing to the requirement of significant experimental effort and time.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">Flux balance analysis (<bold>FBA</bold>) is a widely used method for estimating metabolic flux. In FBA, a pseudo-steady sate is assumed where the sum of incoming fluxes is equal to the sum of outgoing fluxes for each internal metabolite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>]. Computationally, FBA is formalized as linear programming (LP) that maximizes biomass production flux, the value of which is called the growth rate (<bold>GR</bold>). The production rate (<bold>PR</bold>) of each metabolite is estimated under the condition that the GR is maximized. Since LP is polynomial-time solvable and there are many efficient solvers, FBA is applicable for use in genome-scale metabolic models. The fluxes calculated by FBA are known to be correspond with experimentally obtained fluxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24" hwp:id="xref-ref-24-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-24">24</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Therefore, many computational methods have been developed to identify optimal knockout strategies in genome-scale models using FBA. For example, OptKnock identifies global optimal reaction knockouts with a bi-level linear optimization using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>]. The inner problem performs the flux allocation based on the optimization of a particular cellular objective (e.g., maximization of biomass yield, minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>])). The outer problem then maximizes the target production based on gene/reaction knockouts. RobustKnock maximizes the minimum value of the outer problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">23</xref>]. OptOrf and genetic design through multi-objective optimization (GDMO) find gene deletion strategies by MILP with regulatory models and Pareto-optimal solutions, respectively [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>, <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>]. Dynamic Strain Scanning Optimization (DySScO) integrates the dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA) method with other strain algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">26</xref>]. OptStrain and SimOptStrain can identify non-native reactions for target production [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>, <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>]. In addition to knockouts, OptReg considers flux upregulation and downregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Many of the above algorithms are formalized as MILP, which is an NP-hard problem and is computationally very expensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>]. For example, OptKnock takes around 10 hours to find a triple knockout for acetate production in <italic toggle="yes">E.coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>]. To improve runtime performance, different approaches have been developed. OptGene and Genetic Design through Local Search (GDLS) find gene deletion strategies using a genetic algorithm (GA) and local search with multiple search paths, respectively [<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>, <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>].

Fast algorithm of knockout screening for target production based on shadow price analysis (FastPros) is an iterative screening approach to discover reaction knockout strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-10">Recently, Gu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>] developed IdealKnock, which can identify knockout strategies that achieve a higher target production rate for many metabolites compared to the existing methods. The computational time for IdealKnock is within a few minutes for each target metabolite, and the number of knockouts is not explicitly limited before searching. On the other hand, parsimonious enzyme usage FBA (pFBA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>] finds a subset of genes and proteins that contribute to the most efficient metabolic network topology under the given growth conditions. Owing to recent development of technologies for artificial DNA synthesis, it may become important in the near future to design minimum metabolic networks that can achieve the overproduction of useful metabolites by selecting a set of reactions or genes from a genome-scale model.</p><p hwp:id="p-11">In IdealKnock, ideal-type flux distribution (ITF) and the ideal point=(GR, PR) are important concepts. Since the lower GR tends to result in a higher PR in many cases, IdealKnock uses the minimum “P×TMGR” as the lower bound of the GR and maximizes the PR to find the ITF, where 0 &lt; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 1 and TMGR stands for Theoretical Maximum Growth Rate. Reactions carrying no flux in ITF are treated as candidates for knockout. Although IdealKnock calculates ITF by optimizing the PR with a minimum GR, this method may fail to find the optimal (GR, PR) that achieves a higher PR of target metabolites as discussed in Section.</p><p hwp:id="p-12">In this study, we introduce a novel method of calculating parsimonious metabolic networks for producing metabolites (GridProd) by extending the idea of IdealKnock and pFBA. In contrast to IdealKnock, in the calculation of the ideal points, GridProd applies “P” to PR as well as GR. Furthermore, GridProd divides the solution space of FBA into <italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sup>−2</sup> small grids, and conducts LP twice for each grid. The area size of each grid is (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> × <italic toggle="yes">TMGR</italic>) × (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> × <italic toggle="yes">TMPR</italic>). TMPR stands for theoretical maximum production rate. The first LP obtains reactions included in the designed DNA, and the second LP calculates the PR of the target metabolite under the condition that the GR is maximized for each grid. The design strategy of the grid whose PR is the best is then adopted as the GridProd solution.</p><p hwp:id="p-13">Computational experiments were conducted to inspect the efficiency of GridProd using a genome-scale model, iAF1260. The production ability of GridProd strategies was compared to those of IdealKnock and FastPros strategies. GridProd achieves higher PR than IdealKnock for many target metabolites. The average computation time for GridProd is within a few minutes for each target metabolite. The effects of the grid sizes were also inspected. When the solution space was divided into 625 small grids, the obtained PRs were the optimal in the computational experiments, which corresponds to <italic toggle="yes">P</italic><sup>−1</sup> = 25.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-4">Results</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-5">Test for the production of 82 metabolites by exchange reactions</title><p hwp:id="p-14">In the first computational experiment, the PRs of the GridProd design strategies were compared to those of the knockout strategies of IdealKnock and FastPros using 82 native metabolites produced by the exchange reactions of iAF1260.

On the other hand, IdealKnock took 0.3 hours to obtain a strategy for each target metabolite and the knockout number was not limited.

However, PR becomes 0 since the sum of upper bounds of R1 and R2 is 10, and all flow from R1 and R2 goes to R7. If PR is maximized, R6 becomes 8 since R4=5 and R5=3 are the bottle necks. Therefore, TMGR and TMPR are 10 and 8, respectively. If PR is maximized for a fixed GR as in IdealKnock, PR becomes max(10-GR,8).</p><p hwp:id="p-41">The optimal design strategy in this network to obtain the maximum PR under the condition that GR is maximized is to knockout R3 where R5 is optional. In this case, (GR,PR)=(1,4) is obtained. Note that the minimum necessary GR is set to 1 in this example. If R3 is not knocked out, (GR,PR)=(10,0) is always obtained.</p><p hwp:id="p-42">Suppose we adopt the strategy where a set of reactions not included in the initially obtained flux is knocked out. If GR &gt; 1 is fixed and PR is maximized, R3 must be used since the upper bound of R8 is 1. Therefore, R3 is not knocked out, and then (GR,PR)=(10,0) is obtained when GR is maximized. Next, suppose that <italic toggle="yes">GR</italic> ≤ 1 is fixed and PR is maximized. Note that setting <italic toggle="yes">GR</italic> &lt; 1 is possible for the first LP, although the necessary minimum GR is 1 for the second LP. Then, (R3,R5)=(3+GR,5) is obtained, and PR is 8. Since R3 is not knocked out in this case, (GR,PR)=(10,0) is obtained when GR is maximized. Thus, the ideal flow-based approach that maximizes PR for the fixed values of GR cannot identify the strategy of knocking out R3 and does not obtain PR=4.</p><p hwp:id="p-43">To address this, GridProd applies P to both GR and PR. However, there may be multiple flows that satisfy the given constraints for GR and PR. For example, if (GR,PR)=(1,4) is given as the constraints, there are multiple flows satisfying these constraints. However, R4 must be used in any flow since the upper bound of R5 is 3. If R4 is 5, then R8 is 1 and R3=R5=0 holds. If R3 and R5 are knocked out, (GR,PR)=(1,4) is achieved. However, if R4&lt; 5 holds, then R3 and R8 must be used and R5 is optional. Then (GR,PR)=(10,0) is obtained. Since GridProd minimizes the total sum of absolute values of fluxes, (GR,PR)=(1,4) is obtained by knocking out R3.</p><p hwp:id="p-44">To discuss the effects of the size of each grid, we analyze each case where GR∈ {0, 1, 2} and PR∈ {3, 4, 5} are given in the following. Suppose that (GR,PR)=(1,5) or (GR,PR)=(2,4) is given. Then, R4 must be used since the upper bound of R5 is 3. In addition to R4, R3 also must be used since <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>1 + <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>2 = 6 must hold. R5 and R8 are optional. In every case, the consequent reaction knockout results in (GR,PR)=(10,0). Note that the necessary minimum growth is assumed as 1 in this example, however, GR is allowed to be less than 1 if GR ≥ 1 is satisfied in the consequent strategies. When (GR,PR)=(0,5) is given, R4 must be used since the upper bound of R5 is 3. R3 is optional. If R3 is used, then R5 must be used, and R8 is optional. If {R3,R5,R8} is knocked out, then GR becomes 0 and minGrowth cannot be satisfied. If only R8 is knocked out, then (GR,PR)=(10,0) is obtained. When (GR,PR)=(2,3) is given, there are multiple flows. If R4 is not used, then R3 and R5 must be 5 and 3, respectively. Consequently, R4 and R8 are knocked out, and then (GR,PR)=(10,0) is obtained. If R4 is used, R3 must be used since the upper bound of R8 is 1. R5 and R8 are optional. Then, (GR,PR)=(10,0) is obtained. When (GR,PR)=(2,5) is given, R4 must be used since the upper bound of R5 is 3. Since the upper bound of R8 is 1, R3 must be used. R5 and R8 are optional. Then, (GR,PR)=(10,0) is obtained. If (GR,PR) is (0,3), (1,3), or (0,4), then there is no flux satisfying the condition since the lower bound of R2 is 5.</p><p hwp:id="p-45">Therefore, when GR∈{0, 1, 2} and PR∈ {3, 4, 5} are given for the first LP, the consequent (GR,PR) obtained by the second LP is represented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-7-1" hwp:rel-id="T7">Table 7</xref>.

Suppose that the size of each grid is relatively large, and the corresponding constraints are 0 ≤ <italic toggle="yes">GR</italic> ≤ 2 and 3 ≤ <italic toggle="yes">PR</italic> ≤ 5. Then, one of the possible obtained flow by the first LP is (R1,…,R8)=(0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0) since the sum of absolute values of fluxes are minimized in the first LP of GridProd. Consequently, R3, R5, and R8 are knockedout. Then the second LP is not feasible.
