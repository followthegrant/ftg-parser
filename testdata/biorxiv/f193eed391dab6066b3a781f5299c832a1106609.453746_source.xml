While a single, discrete movement like a pointing gesture may be mostly ballistic, more precise aiming movements typically require an error correction phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52" hwp:id="xref-ref-52-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-52">Woodworth, 1899</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">Craik, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">Abrams et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">Sainburg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">Elliott et al., 2010</xref>). Yet the way neurons in motor areas of the brain encode and generate corrective movements to achieve movement precision is relatively unexplored. When examining populations of neurons in primary motor cortex during instructed movements, it has become clear that predictable dynamics occur with past neural spiking history being partially predictive of future spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">Maynard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">Jackson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49" hwp:id="xref-ref-49-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-49">Truccolo et al., 2005</xref>; Sarma et al., 2010). Yet behaving animals also respond to new sensorimotor information such as tasks that require precision and one might expect predictable neural dynamics to be reduced. Conversely, the predictable neural dynamics may explain limits on behavior.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Most experimental tasks to study individual neurons in primary motor cortex have used instructed movements with a clear onset and offset. These single movement tasks have identified a variety of movement features being encoded (Evarts, 1968; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48" hwp:id="xref-ref-48-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-48">Thach, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">Georgopoulos et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">Kalaska et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">Kakei et al., 1999</xref>). In addition to encoded features, however, there is also a large condition- independent component in the firing rate of neurons in motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">Rouse and Schieber, 2018</xref>). Condition-independent neural activity is the change in a neuron’s firing rate from baseline over time that happens regardless of the instructed movement for any given trial within a given task. Techniques like demixed principal component analysis partition a neural population’s activity into condition-independent modulation and the more classically described tuning to task conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23" hwp:id="xref-ref-23-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-23">Kobak et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-9">In addition to being condition-independent or -dependent, changes in firing rate can also be synchronous or asynchronous/rotational across a population. Primary motor cortex neurons are not all synchronously time-locked for example, but rather have an asynchronous range of onset latencies from 200ms to 0ms before movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">Moran and Schwartz, 1999</xref>). Condition-independent activity is also not a synchronous increase and decrease in firing rate for each neuron but a more complex neural trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53" hwp:id="xref-ref-53-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-53">Yu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">Cunningham and Yu, 2014</xref>). The inherent cyclical structure for reaching movements is hypothesized to be related to intrinsic cortical dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">Hall et al., 2014</xref>) with the firing of some neurons reliably occurring earlier relative to other neurons with the generation of movement.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">Cyclic, condition-independent neural dynamics presents a challenge in describing how corrective movements necessary for precision might be encoded using the traditional models typically ascribed to primary motor cortex (M1). For experimental tasks with single instructed reaches, it is straightforward to subtract away condition-independent firing rate and use the remaining firing rate to identify the encoding of movement direction. A linear “cosine-tuning” model fits this data well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">Georgopoulos et al., 1986</xref>; Salinas and Abbott, 1994). Experiments varying instructed speeds have shown larger changes for faster movements suggesting some condition-independent neural activity is speed tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">Moran and Schwartz, 1999</xref>). However, to decode small amplitude, precise movements with online correction, a more accurate model of condition-independent activity is likely needed to accurately identify the remaining activity that encodes the various movement conditions.</p><p hwp:id="p-11">In this work, we focus on the condition-independent, rotational neural activity. These are the changes in firing rate that are consistent across movements but vary in timing across neurons. Better understanding these condition-independent cyclic dynamics will better define what constitutes a movement and how corrective movements are generated after an initial movement. It is unclear if neurons encode these smaller movements similarly with the same range of latencies. If there is an ordered set of latencies, this might better define a series of submovements related to behavior and also better identify and separate the condition-dependent encoding of movement features.</p><p hwp:id="p-12">In the present analysis, we test whether neural dynamics in cortex are similar between initial and corrective movements, examining the condition-independent activity across a wide range of speeds. A precision center-out task that required moving to small targets was used to elicit visuomotor corrections. We examined whether corrective movements in our task are discrete submovements, behaviorally similar to initial movements. We then ask whether condition-independent activity follows a similar neural trajectory that is cyclic for both initial and corrective submovements. Finally, we ask whether common neural dynamics improve our predictions of behavior for when initial and corrective movements occur.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-3"><title hwp:id="title-6">Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-4"><title hwp:id="title-7">Non-human primates</title><p hwp:id="p-13">Two male rhesus monkeys, P and Q (weight 11 and 10 kg, ages 7 and 6 years old, respectively), were subjects in the present study.

The monkey manipulated a custom, 18 cm long, cylindrical rod attached to the joystick housing. The joystick moved freely with minimal resistance as the spring mechanism for providing centering, restorative force was removed. The joystick could move approximately 15⁰ from vertical which corresponds to a workspace of 9.3 cm in both the vertical and horizontal directions. The cursor directly represented measured joystick position and moved within a 1000 x1000 pixel workspace centered on the display. The cursor workspace limits were slightly within the physical limits of the joystick. Thus 110 pixels correspond to approximately 1 cm of movement at the end of the joystick. The cursor on the display was a small cross that represented a single point in the workspace. The custom software for task control sampled the joystick data, updated the scene, and stored the cursor position (equivalent to joystick position) and trial event times at 100 Hz.</p><p hwp:id="p-15">The precision center-out task consisted of three sets of eight peripheral targets located equidistance and equally spaced in 45° intervals around a center, home target (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-1" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The center target had a radius of 75 pixels. Each center-out target—defined in polar coordinates—was one of three different sizes i) large targets spanning 45° of the workspace and covering 250-450 pixels from the center, ii) shallower targets also spanning 45° but covering a width only 325-375 pixels from the center, and iii) narrower targets only spanning 15° covering 250-450 pixels from the center. All 24 targets (3 sizes x 8 locations) were presented pseudo-randomly in equal amounts throughout a session.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" hwp:id="F1" hwp:rev-id="xref-fig-1-1 xref-fig-1-2 xref-fig-1-3 xref-fig-1-4 xref-fig-1-5"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;453746v4/FIG1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">F1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">fig1</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><p hwp:id="p-16">Idealized representation of both the synchronous and rotational components of condition-independent and -dependent changes in neuronal firing rate. A) The firing rates for four neurons (blue, orange, yellow, and purple) are shown for reaches to four target directions (light to dark grayscale). The overall firing rates are different firing rates for the four neurons for the four target condition. By time averaging across the four conditions, the condition-independent firing rates and the residual condition-dependent firing rates are both identified. B) Next, analysis of the population reveals that firing rates can be decomposed to either i) synchronous activity across all neurons at each time point or ii) rotational firing rate changes. When plotted in the time domain, the firing rates all modulate synchronously in time or switch between different neurons firing more at different times. C) The neural space visualizes the population activity by showing each neuron’s firing rate as a point along an orthogonal dimension with time represented as a trajectory through this space. In this representation, the difference between synchronous and rotational activity is better appreciated. Synchronous activity is movement along a single neural dimension while rotational activity is movement between dimensions. Note, the dimensions defined by individual neurons are shown projected in a 2D plane. Only the given component (synchronous/rotational and condition-independent/-dependent) are shown for these four example neurons for visualization purposes. In a much higher dimensional space when recording from a large number of neurons, the possibility of finding dimensions with little overlap between components is much greater.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="453746v4_fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-1"/></fig><p hwp:id="p-17">For each trial, following the subject acquiring the home target and performing a required initial hold ranging from 300-500 ms, the instruction occurred with the given trial’s correct target changing from black to green. Following instruction, the monkey could move the cursor immediately to contact the correct target. At contact, the outline of all targets changed colors from white to black providing visual feedback when the cursor was within the target boundaries. After contacting the desired target, the cursor was required to remain within the target for a variable hold time of 500-600 ms. If the cursor left the target during a final hold, the monkey was allowed to leave and contact the target again and complete a final hold. Once a successful final hold of 500-600 ms was completed, the animal received a liquid reward. Both the required initial and final hold times for each trial were randomly sampled from a uniform distribution.</p><p hwp:id="p-18">A peak finding algorithm to identify local maxima (<italic toggle="yes">findpeaks</italic> function in Matlab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">Mathworks, 2020</xref>)) was used for analysis of the timing of cursor speed peaks. Cursor speeds were identified as peaks if they met the following criteria: i) the peak speed was greater than 250 pixels/s and ii) the peak’s prominence— the height difference between the peak and the larger of the two adjacent troughs (minimum speed before encountering a larger peak)—was at least 50% of the absolute height of the peak. All cursor speed peaks and surrounding time windows were identified as submovements within a trial.</p><p hwp:id="p-19">Initial peaks were identified as the first submovement that ended at least 150 pixels from the center (approximately halfway to the peripheral target). Any small movements before the initial speed peak— 506 (4.6% of trials) for P and 616 (7.0% of trials) for Q—were discarded from further analysis.</p><p hwp:id="p-20">Additional speed peaks following the initial speed peak were defined as corrective submovements. To focus analysis on submovements made to successfully acquire the target, corrective submovements were only included if some portion of the acceleration phase—time from preceding speed trough to speed peak—occurred outside the peripheral target.</p></sec><sec id="s2c" hwp:id="sec-6"><title hwp:id="title-9">Neural Recordings</title><p hwp:id="p-21">Floating microelectrode arrays (MicroProbes for Life Science) were implanted in the anterior lip and bank of the central sulcus to record from primary motor cortex (M1) in each monkey, using methods described in detail previously [citation redacted]. For monkey P, recordings were collected from six 16- channel arrays implanted in M1. For monkey Q, two 32-channel arrays and one 16-channel array in M1 were used. The location of the implanted arrays were previously reported in (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) of [citation redacted] and spanned the forelimb area of M1. Intracortical microstimulation on single electrodes with a current up to a maximum of 100 µA (0.2ms stimulation pulse width, 3ms interpulse interval) with the animal lightly anesthetized with ketamine showed a mixture of evoked forelimb movements. Of the 96 electrodes for monkey P, stimulation of 11 sites elicited proximal arm movements, 6 sites elicited wrist movements, and 21 sites elicited movement of the digits. Of the 80 electrodes for monkey Q, 34 sites were proximal, 9 sites were wrist, and 25 were digits.

Note, in the neural space this is equivalent to the L1 distance or city block distance. To aid in visualizing the average change in firing rate of all recorded spiking units across time, we chose to use classical multi-dimensional scaling (also known as Principal Coordinates Analysis, <italic toggle="yes">cmdscale</italic> in Matlab) on the calculated firing rate differences.</p><p hwp:id="p-25">Multidimensional scaling reduces the high-dimensional dataset to a chosen number of dimensions while preserving as well as possible the distance (differences in firing rates) between original datapoints.</p><sec id="s2d1" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-11">Identifying condition-independent, rotational neural activity</title><p hwp:id="p-26">We focused our analysis on the condition-independent, rotational activity in the recorded neural population. To explain the various features of neural activity, we’ll consider an idealized example of four neurons, shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>. First, the change in firing rate related to a task can be in part the same for all movement conditions (condition-independent) and/or in part vary depending on the particular movement condition (condition-dependent). The trial-averaged firing rates, including both condition-independent and –dependent firing rates (but excluding noise), for four idealized model neurons during a typical center-out reaching task are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-3" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>. In 1A, the condition-independent firing rates for each neuron are obtained by averaging the overall firing rates across all four target conditions, and condition-dependent firing rates then are obtained after subtracting away the condition-independent firing rates from the overall firing rate for each condition.</p><p hwp:id="p-27">Changes in firing rate can also be either synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous, time- locked activity represents changes in firing rate that happen simultaneously across the neural population, while asynchronous activity of varying time course in different neurons can lead to patterns of traveling waves or oscillations in the population with a predictable progression in time. As shown in the time- domain in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-4" hwp:rel-id="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, the synchronous activity (top) with all neurons having the same time course can either be condition-independent (left) or depend on the target condition (right). Similarly, the asynchronous activity (bottom) with various neurons leading and lagging can either be condition-independent activity (left) or target dependent (right).</p><p hwp:id="p-28">Alternatively, the firing rates of the neuron population can be visualized as neural trajectories in a Cartesian neural space where each neuron’s firing rate is plotted on an orthogonal dimension.</p><p hwp:id="p-29">Synchronous activity (top) appears as a trajectory that moves along a single dimension away or towards the origin. Asynchronous activity (bottom), when firing rates change at different times among the various neurons, appears as trajectories that traverse across various neural dimensions. Thus, the overall neural trajectory is caused by changes in firing rate across the population of neurons and projecting the data into different neural dimensions, i.e. subspaces, results in identification of the different features of neural activity.</p><p hwp:id="p-30">For a complex task with various submovements and less well-defined conditions such as our precision center-out task, the condition-independent activity provides a useful analysis to identify repeated activity that defines a submovement. While the synchronous rise and fall of global firing rate provides some information, the rotational activity has the potential to improve identification of the repeated patterns of neural activation related to movement execution. Like any model of a large number of neurons, our model relies on simplifying assumptions. The condition-independent averaging across all trials is only relevant for the experimental data under study and should not be interpreted as condition- independent across all behavior. Additionally, the neural activity is likely neither fully synchronous nor rotates perfectly as a circle but likely forms an intermediate ellipse. Finally, a high-dimensional neural dataset is likely to have more complex dynamics than can be modeled with only linear dynamics that are limited to a combination of rotation about and growth/shrinkage from the origin. Nevertheless, identifying the condition-independent, rotational activity can be a useful tool to study brain activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2" hwp:id="sec-9"><title hwp:id="title-12">Dynamical Systems Model</title><p hwp:id="p-31">Dynamical system modeling is a useful way to characterize the observed changes in firing rates. The simplest is a system of coupled, first-order ordinary differential equations where changes in firing rate depend only on a linear transform matrix multiplied by the current firing rates. In this model, the changes in firing rate can grow/shrink along a single dimension (synchronous) as well as rotate across dimensions (asynchronous). The eigen decomposition of the transform matrix yields eigenvalues with the real part representing growing or shrinking away from the origin while the imaginary part represents rotations.</p><p hwp:id="p-32">To identify and analyze potential repeatable temporal dynamics of the neural population that correlated with movement, our neural data was modeled as a linear, time-invariant system. This model was built using only the condition-independent activity by averaging the firing rates for individual spiking units across all trials regardless of the movement condition (i.e. target location). The condition- independent activity was then submitted to jPCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>) to identify the two- dimensional neural plane with the most rotational/cyclic activity. Note, this utilization of the jPCA algorithm on only the condition-independent activity is different than the typical application of jPCA to data containing the condition-dependent activity. Once this jPC neural plane was identified, this work introduces a new analysis variable—condition-independent phase (CIφ)—which estimates at each time the instantaneous phase by using the Hilbert transform of the firing rates within the identified two- dimensional plane. More thorough descriptions of the dynamical systems model, jPCA dimensionality reduction, and CIφ estimation are given in the Extended data and figures.</p><p hwp:id="p-33">The calculation of the jPC plane and the CIφ was performed using 5-fold cross-validation. Each recording session was divided into 5 testing sets of trials each containing 20% of the data. The jPC plane was calculated by training on the other 80% of the data and then tested on each test set. All presented results for CIφ is using the test data projected into the jPC dimensions identified by the separate training set.</p></sec><sec id="s2d3" hwp:id="sec-10"><title hwp:id="title-13">Firing Rate vs. Speed Model</title><p hwp:id="p-34">As a comparison to our dynamical system model and phase analysis, the average firing rate across the neural population—the synchronous, condition-independent neural activity—was also used to identify when maximal firing rates occurred and could predict future speed peaks. Since some neurons increase their firing rate and others decrease their firing rate on average with movement, a linear prediction model was used to create a weighted sum of the neural firing rates to predict cursor speed peaks. The average firing rate of each unit from 300 ms before to 100 ms after each peak speed was used in a linear regression to predict the peak cursor speed for each submovement. The regression model thus generated weighting coefficients for each neuron’s prediction of movement speed. These coefficients were then used to weight the instantaneous firing rates at any time point to generate a speed estimate. While this estimate predicts upcoming movement speed, we show the estimate from the firing rates with no lag added to report the time when the maximal firing rate occurred, not the peak speed of actual movement.</p></sec><sec id="s2d4" hwp:id="sec-11"><title hwp:id="title-14">Neural Subspace Overlap</title><p hwp:id="p-35">To measure the amount of overlap of condition-independent neural activity between initial and corrective submovements, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) on the average firing rates relative to peak speed for all neurons in the N-dimensional neural space. We identified the 6-PC space that accounted for the most condition-independent variance for either initial or corrective submovements. We then projected the condition-independent activity from the opposite submovement type in this 6 PC space.

This relationship tended to be conserved across initial and corrective movements with the purple spiking units being earlier firing for initial and corrective submovements while the orange tended to be late.

These times were selected because the highest global firing rate occurred at approximately -150 ms before peak speed, -450 and +150 ms were times of low firing rates, and -300 and 0 ms were times of intermediate firing rates as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-3-3" hwp:rel-id="F3">Figure 3</xref>. Yet we observe in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-2" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 5</xref> that the average change in firing rates between the intermediate times (-300 and 0 ms), was only slightly less than the firing rate change between the early (-450 and -150 ms) or late (-150 and +150 ms) time intervals. Thus, changes in firing rate for individual spiking units did not all synchronously align with the global change in firing rate. This was true for both initial and corrective submovements. This almost circular neural trajectory—a width nearly equal to height—demonstrates that the condition-independent activity does not occur as a single rise and fall in global firing rate, but rather as a neural trajectory with certain neuron’s firing rates modulating earlier relative to movement while others modulate later. The neural trajectories are also not perfectly circular but appear to spiral. This is likely due to the changes of firing rate being largest at the onset of movement for the initial movements and then large again at the end of corrective movements. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-3" hwp:rel-id="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, this corresponds to rising from a lower baseline at the initial movements and falling back to a similar low baseline at the end of corrective movements but only reaching an intermediate firing rate at the time between initial and corrective movements.</p><p hwp:id="p-48">Additionally, the average change in firing rate per neuron that was observed for each trial was calculated. This change in firing rate includes not just the condition-independent change but also the change dependent on the movement condition as well as any trial-by-trial noise. For initial submovements, the average total change in firing rate across all three time points was 93.2% (monkey P) and 94.0% (Q) with the condition-independent changes being 40.0% (P) and 50.1% (Q). Thus, surprisingly, the average change in firing rate per neuron for each trial was nearly as large for corrective as initial submovements. The smaller amplitude submovements did not result in less change in firing rate within a given trial but only the condition-independent firing rate change when averaged across all submovements.</p><p hwp:id="p-49">We next wished to examine the firing rate variance and dimensionality of the trial-averaged condition-independent neural activity. The variance of the condition-independent firing rates from a baseline average for corrective submovements was 37.0% (P) and 48.8% (Q) of the condition- independent variance for initial submovements. Principal component analysis was used to assess the dimensionality of the condition-independent activity identified by time-averaging firing rates relative to peak speed. Greater than 97% of all condition-independent variance was observed to occur in 6 dimensions for both animals in both initial and corrective submovements (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-1" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).

When comparing the amount of overlap in condition-independent activity between the initial and corrective submovements, there was considerable but not complete overlap i.e. neural trajectories were neither completely parallel or orthogonal to each other. Approximately 80-85% of the corrective condition-independent neural activity occurred in the same 6 dimensions as the initial subspace.

To examine this possibility further, we built a simple linear system model using the neural firing rates from both initial and corrective submovements to characterize any common temporal dynamics that might be present. The neural firing rates were again averaged across all movement directions to examine only the common condition-independent activity. The plane in the neural space with the most rotational neural activity was identified using jPCA. We labeled the two neural dimensions with the most rotational condition-independent activity as CIx and CIy. To compare consistently across recording sessions as well as monkeys, the pair of dimensions from each session was rotated such that CIx was aligned most closely with the time course of the global average firing rate across the population (shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-4-4" hwp:rel-id="F4">Fig 4A</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-52">The average firing rates for all initial and corrective submovements in our identified CI plane are shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-6-2" hwp:rel-id="F6">Figure 6</xref>.

Considering the initial versus corrective submovements, the peaks and troughs of both CIx and CIy, while differing in magnitude, were similar in their timing. The peak in the CIx dimension—defined as the dimension in the plane that best correlated with the global average firing rate of the population—occurred approximately 150-200 ms before peak speed for both initial and corrective submovements, whereas the peak in the CIy dimension occurred near the time of peak speed for both. The initial and corrective neural trajectories are very similar in their shape and direction of rotation within the plane, with the trajectories for corrective submovements resembling a smaller, scaled version of the larger trajectories for initial submovements.</p><p hwp:id="p-53">We then examined the instantaneous phases of CIx and CIy activity, calculated using the Hilbert transform.

The phase of CIx (solid lines) and that of CIy (dashed lines) each were similar for both initial and corrective submovements, with the zero phase of CIx occurring about 150 ms before the peak speed while CIy lagged by approximate π/2 with the zero crossing around peak speed.

We then examined the percentage of the total neural variance explained when the condition-independent activity was defined by CIφ compared to trial averaging based on time-alignment. Note, this percentage of condition-independent activity is relative to the total change in firing rates which also includes condition-dependent changes as well as trial-by-trial variability. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-7-3" hwp:rel-id="F7">Figure 7C</xref>, more neural variance was captured by binning the data based on CIφ than by binning the data based on time relative to speed peaks. While the difference was modest for initial submovements, a larger, statistically significant increase occurred for corrective submovements with the variance explained going from 2.9% for time-aligned to 5.9% for CIφ- aligned for monkey P and 2.2% to 4.2% for monkey Q (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-1-2" hwp:rel-id="T1">Table 1</xref>). The amount of the CIφ explained variance that occurred only in the CIx and CIy dimensions was calculated next. For the two monkeys and the two conditions—initial and corrective—the variance in the two dimensions, CIx and CIy, accounted for between 54% and 76% of the condition-independent variance in the four instances. The CIx dimension accounted for more in all instances with the CIy being nearly equal for monkey P initial submovements while the biggest disparity occurred for monkey Q corrective submovements with the CIy variance being 37% of the CIx variance. Altogether, these observations suggest that compared to aligning condition-independent neural activity across submovements based on time relative to peak speed, more consistent alignment is achieved using CIφ.</p><p hwp:id="p-58">We therefore examined the relationship between CIφ and hand movement. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-8-1" hwp:rel-id="F8">Figure 8A</xref> illustrates the temporal distribution of when CIφ =0 relative to the time of peak hand speed.

The magnitude of the condition-independent neural activity that occurred for corrective submovements was approximately one-third to one-half the magnitude of that for the initial submovements. This decreased change in average firing rate approximately matched the decrease in movement speed for the corrective compared to the initial submovements suggesting speed tuning of the condition-independent activity. This does not imply, however, that each individual trial and each individual neuron have smaller changes of firing rate during smaller amplitude movements. In fact, the overall total change in firing rates—the combined condition-independent activity, condition-dependent encoding of task variables, and unexplained noise—for corrective submovements was of nearly the same magnitude (90-95%, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-5-3" hwp:rel-id="F5">Figure 5</xref>) as that for initial submovements. Only when averaging firing rates—time aligned to the peak movement speed or the decoded condition-independent phase—were the differences in firing rate modulation between initial and corrective movements apparent.

Separate corrective submovements thus are encoded by sequential cycles of neural activity.</p><p hwp:id="p-69">Rather than continuously moving the hand toward the target at all times, the subjects’ movements appeared as pulsatile bursts of joystick movement and presumably muscle contraction. This work supports the notion of movement fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">Hatsopoulos et al., 2007</xref>) and extends it to a task with a larger range of movement amplitudes including small, corrective movements. Additionally, our CIφ algorithm provides a useful way to identify the timing of each movement fragment by utilizing recent advances in applying dynamical system modeling to neural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>). Large condition-independent activity has been suggested to make brain dynamics more robust to noise by increasing the differences in neural signals even when the muscle activation pattern at certain time points look very similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">Russo et al., 2018</xref>). In the context of precise, corrective movements, one might speculate cyclic brain dynamics organize movements into distinct submovements to create time-varying neural and musculoskeletal dynamics that are more reliable for motor control. Additionally, by having larger changes in firing rate even for corrective movements that occupy different dimensions of the neural space, the larger separation of the neural signals for different movements may be hypothesized to encode the desired movement more accurately, either large initial or small corrective.</p><p hwp:id="p-70">It is difficult to determine how much of the cyclic brain activity and behavior observed is caused by intrinsic neural dynamics in M1 compared to sensorimotor feedback control and/or a cognitive strategy.

Observations of additional submovements defined by second or third speed peaks do not necessarily require a feedback controller with discrete updates.

Further work examining neural activity in various tasks and/or additional sensorimotor brain areas is needed for clearer descriptions of the neural dynamics of the sensory processing, cognitive planning, and motor execution for precise, corrective movements.</p><p hwp:id="p-71">It also is unclear how consistent our observed condition-independent cyclic neural dynamics are for other forelimb movements besides reaching confined to a single limb.

Additionally, the increased degrees-of-freedom and diversity of hand grasping shapes compared to planar reaching may prevent a simple low-dimensional neural representation.

Previous work has typically not focused on how close neural dynamics align with behavior and not analyzed only condition-independent neural dynamics. The different analytical methods for previous studies make it difficult to determine how well our algorithm might generalize and how well it identifies truly condition- independent activity on very different tasks. However, firing rate changes independent of movement features with various time lags seem likely to be present across various tasks. Thus, we hypothesize the portion of cyclic dynamics identified with our condition-independent focused algorithm might be more common and robust than other rotational neural dynamics and have a more observable direct link to behavior.</p><p hwp:id="p-72">The cyclic dynamics of corrective movements have important implications for brain-computer interfaces (BCI).

The ability to predict the phase of a movement—like CIφ presented here—might further allow for much better prediction of when the subject intends to move, contact the target, and make a corrective movement. The cyclic dynamics of the condition-independent neural activity may also lead to better descriptions of the condition-dependent activity that encode task features, specifically the observation that direction encoding is often not fixed but shifts with different phases of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41" hwp:id="xref-ref-41-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-41">Sergio and Kalaska, 1998</xref>; Churchland and Shenoy, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44" hwp:id="xref-ref-44-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-44">Suminski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47" hwp:id="xref-ref-47-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-47">Suway et al., 2017</xref>), enabling decoders of movement direction that change with time. All leading to a more robust description of the of neural encoding of precise and corrective movements.</p><p hwp:id="p-73">Extended Data 1. Matlab code to calculate the CIφ is available on Github.</p><p hwp:id="p-74">Since the trial data contains corrective movements in addition to the large initial movements that were not precisely time aligned to trial events for averaging condition-independent neural activity, we developed a novel algorithm to iteratively average the firing rates, calculate CIφ, then average the firing rates again based on the CIφ. This iterative process involves three steps: i) Each unit’s firing rate is averaged across all trials to determine its condition-independent firing rate. ii) Dimensionality reduction is performed using PCA and jPCA on the condition-independent firing rates to identify the neural plane with the most rotational/cyclic condition-independent activity. iii) The instantaneous phase is calculated using the Hilbert transform on the first two jPC dimensions for all data points. Matlab code is available on GitHub. Further details are available in the Readme document attached to the code.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-26">Acknowledgements</title><p hwp:id="p-75">This work

trial events for averaging condition-independent neural activity, we developed a novel algorithm to iteratively average the firing rates, calculate CIφ, then average the firing rates again based on

This iterative process involves three steps: i) Each unit’s firing rate is averaged across all trials to determine its condition-independent firing rate. ii) Dimensionality reduction is performed using PCA and jPCA on the condition-independent firing rates to identify the neural plane with the most rotational/cyclic condition-independent activity. iii) The instantaneous phase is calculated using the Hilbert transform on the first two jPC dimensions for all data points.

For classic neurophysiology experiments, this can be calculated by averaging time-aligned data. However, since trials were of varying durations and many included corrective movements, simple time alignment of trials was difficult. Data was therefore aligned based on each time-point’s calculated CIφ rather than absolute time.</p><p hwp:id="p-79">Since CIφ depends on the averaged condition-independent activity and the condition-independent activity was averaged by CIφ alignment, an iterative approach was required. An initial estimate using simple time-alignment averaging of all initial and corrective submovements was used for the first iteration. For each subsequent iteration, the condition-independent firing rates for each unit were calculated by averaging all data points when the CIφ values were similar. The average firing rate was estimated using a sliding window of CIφ values with a step size of π/50 and a window size of π/25 to generate 100 equally spaced samples ranging from -π to π.</p></sec><sec id="s5b" hwp:id="sec-26"><title hwp:id="title-31">ii) PCA and jPCA to identify rotational/cyclic neural activity</title><p hwp:id="p-80">Next, the condition-independent firing rates were submitted to PCA and jPCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>) to identify the neural dimensions with the most cyclic activity.

The transform matrix of this model (A) can be separated into a symmetric matrix representing pure scaling and a skew-symmetric matrix representing pure rotational dynamics. By taking the eigendecomposition of the skew-symmetric matrix, we obtain pairs of purely imaginary eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors that define planes of rotation in the neural space rank-ordered from greatest to least rotation. In the present analysis, only the first plane with the greatest condition-independent rotation was used and we defined the two dimensions of the plane as CIx and CIy. Additionally, to obtain a consistent CIφ across recording sessions, CIx was defined as the dimension in the CIx/CIy plane with the most variance. The positive CIx direction was defined as having more positive than negative coefficients in the neural space which corresponds to the direction where more units have an increased firing rate. Choosing this convention causes an increase in CIx to generally align with the onset of initial movement, since a majority of units increase firing rates at the onset of movement.</p></sec><sec id="s5c" hwp:id="sec-27"><title hwp:id="title-32">iii) Instantaneous phase estimate</title><p hwp:id="p-81">Finally, the instantaneous phase were estimated by i) bidirectional bandpass filtering of the activity in both the CIx and CIy dimensions between 0.5-5 Hz with a 1<sup>st</sup> order Butterworth filter, ii) performing the Hilbert transform of both filtered signal (<italic toggle="yes">sx</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">sy</italic>) to generate a transformed signal <inline-formula hwp:id="inline-formula-1"><alternatives hwp:id="alternatives-3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="453746v4_inline1.gif" hwp:id="inline-graphic-1"/></alternatives></inline-formula> that is a 90° phase shift of every Fourier component in the frequency domain to create an analytic representation of CIx and CIy, and iii) calculating the angle of the resulting analytic signal <inline-formula hwp:id="inline-formula-2"><alternatives hwp:id="alternatives-4"><inline-graphic xlink:href="453746v4_inline2.gif" hwp:id="inline-graphic-2"/></alternatives></inline-formula> to estimate the instantaneous phase in each dimension, and iv) which we then sum (with a <inline-formula hwp:id="inline-formula-3"><alternatives hwp:id="alternatives-5"><inline-graphic xlink:href="453746v4_inline3.gif" hwp:id="inline-graphic-3"/></alternatives></inline-formula> phase shift added to <italic toggle="yes">ϕy</italic>) to obtain a single instantaneous phase estimate for the neural activity within the plane which we call the condition-independent phase (<italic toggle="yes">CIφ</italic>).
