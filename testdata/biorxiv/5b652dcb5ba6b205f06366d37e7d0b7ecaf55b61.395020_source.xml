OA is the most common joint disease characterized by pain and loss of function resulting from the breakdown of the articular cartilage [<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>]. Pathologically, OA joints exhibit cartilage damage, osteophyte formation, subchondral bone sclerosis, and varying degrees of synovitis [<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>]. Altered joint metabolism, inflammation, increased joint loading, joint injury, and other factors contribute to the development of OA [<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>-<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>].</p><p hwp:id="p-7">This multifactorial nature of OA contributes to a broad variation in presentation of symptoms, progression of disease, and response to treatments. In addition to the multiple contributing factors, the trajectory of OA prognosis is highly variable. Some patients rapidly progress into severe stages of disease, whereas others remain relatively stable for decades [<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>-<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>]. Similarly, the perception of pain is also variable, with some patients experiencing minimal pain despite obvious joint space narrowing and others experiencing extreme pain with minimal joint space narrowing. OA was recently described as having multiple phenotypes in which subsets of disease characteristics drive differences between subgroups of patients with distinct OA outcomes [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>]. However, more data are needed to define these phenotypes.</p><p hwp:id="p-8">OA heterogeneity poses many challenges for understanding pathogenesis, facilitating diagnosis and therapeutic interventions [<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>-<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>]. Defining phenotypes of OA is important for many reasons. First, this would provide insight into factors that contribute to the development of these distinct phenotypes [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>]. Secondly, it would allow for development of targeted treatments for specific subgroups of OA [<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>]. Finally, given the heterogeneity of OA, defining phenotypes is crucial for identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis across all phenotypes or within specific subgroups once identified.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Metabolomics is a promising method for distinguishing phenotypes. Metabolomics analyzes large numbers of small-molecule intermediates [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>]. Changes in the metabolome occur rapidly and reflect the overall biological response from changes in the genome, transcriptome, and proteome [<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>]. Metabolomic profiling generates a phenotype that characterizes functional cellular biochemistry [<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>, <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>]. Global metabolomics is promising because it produces a global view of the metabolome with minimal bias. By focusing on all metabolite features in the sample, this analysis develops a network of pathways that illustrate metabolic perturbations with disease. Therefore, global metabolomic profiling is not only beneficial for identifying specific metabolites as potential biomarkers as demonstrated previously [<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>], but also providing insight into the underlying mechanism of disease.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">The SF is an ultrafiltrate of the plasma containing additional molecules produced by the cells in joint tissue. SF provides lubrication between the articular cartilage surfaces and eliminates metabolic waste. The SF is in direct contact with other OA-affected tissues (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> articular cartilage, synovium, etc.) and will reflect local changes with disease [<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>]. This makes the SF a promising biofluid for phenotype identification given the heterogenous pathology of OA in the joint.</p><p hwp:id="p-11">The objective of this study is to apply our established LC-MS-based global metabolomic profiling method to generate metabolic phenotypes of SF from donors across all stages of OA (grades 0-IV). By characterizing global metabolomic profiles of early and late OA, this study seeks to (1) identify differences in metabolic pathways throughout disease progression from healthy to late stage disease, and (2) classify patients within early and late OA into subgroups representative of potential OA phenotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform global metabolomic profiling of SF from donors with early and late stage OA to investigate metabolic perturbations throughout disease progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-6"><title hwp:id="title-8">Methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-7"><title hwp:id="title-9">Human Synovial Fluid</title><p hwp:id="p-12"><italic toggle="yes">Post mortem</italic> SF samples (n=75) from knee joints were used for this study under an IRB exemption.

The Kolomogorov-Smirnov test (KS-test) was used in MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc. Natick, MA) to compare cumulative median metabolite distributions between cohorts. This nonparametric test does not require assumptions about the underlying distributions and therefore is useful for metabolomics datasets that typically contain non-normal distributions. Specific differences between multiple groups were determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) F-tests. Two-tailed Studentâs t-tests examined specific differences between two groups only. Differentially regulated metabolites between two groups were visualized by volcano plot to assess both significance and magnitude of change simultaneously. Metabolite features with a p-value (FDR corrected) less than 0.05 and greater than twofold change were considered both statistically significant and biologically important in these analyses.</p><p hwp:id="p-18">Multivariate methods assessed variations in the metabolomic datasets.

HCA assessed subgroups of donors exhibiting distinct OA phenotypes. HCA is visualized using heatmaps, known as a clustergrams, to analyze the overall metabolomic profiles.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is another unsupervised method used to analyze metabolomics data. PCA orthogonally transforms a set of observations into principal components that each represent a fraction of the overall variance within the dataset. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) is a supervised classification method that reveals the underlying source of distinction between known groups. PLS-DA scores each variable in each component indicating how important that variable was in contributing to the separation.</p><p hwp:id="p-19">Metabolite features (m/z values) were matched to known metabolite identities and mapped to relevant pathways using the metabolite library and pathway enrichment tool, <italic toggle="yes">mummichog</italic> [<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">25</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Mummichog</italic> predicts a network of functional activity based on the projection of detected metabolite features onto local pathways.

Age and sex were provided for all donors, BMI was provided for most, but others lacked cause of death, prior medical history, and/or ethnicity.
