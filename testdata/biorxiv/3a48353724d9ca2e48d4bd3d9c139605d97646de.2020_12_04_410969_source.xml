However, the underlying mechanism of SUDEP remains elusive. Our previous study demonstrated that enhancement of serotonin (5-HT) synthesis by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) significantly reduced the incidence of seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) in DBA/1 mice SUDEP models. Given that 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) plays an important role in mediating the respiration system in brain, we hypothesized that 5-HT2AR is of great significance to modulate S-IRA and SUDEP. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the decreased incidence of S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or PTZ injection by administration with 5-HTP will be blocked by administration with ketanserin (KET), a selective antagonist of 5HT2AR, in DBA/1 mice SUDEP models to examine the role of 5-HT2AR in modulating S-IRA. Our results suggested that the decreased incidence of S-IRA by 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a precursor for central nervous system (CNS) serotonin (5-HT) synthesis, was significantly reversed by IP or intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injection of ketanserin in our models. Furthermore, given that 5-HT2AR locating in the pre-Bötzinger complex (PBC) which plays a key role in regulating the respiratory rhythm, we wonder whether the lower incidence of S-IRA by IP with 5-HTP was significantly reversed by KET which inhibits 5-HT2AR in the above models and acts on the 5-HT2AR in pre-Bötzinger complex. To test our hypothesis, we activated the neural circuit between dorsal raphe nucleus and the pre-Bötzinger complex by optogenetics technology. Our results indicated that the lower incidence of S-IRA evoked by PTZ by stimulating the TPH2-ChETA, a variant of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) in DBA/1 mice and the suppressant effects was significantly reversed by administration of KET in bilateral pre-Bötzinger complex without changing electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. The neural circuit between DR and the pre-Botzinger complex was confirmed by injection of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB)555, a nerve tracer, in DR or the pre-Botzinger complex, respectively. Taken together, our findings suggested that targeting the neural circuit between the DR and the pre-Bötzinger complex in which 5-HT2AR plays a critical role in regulating this process would be promising to prevent SUDEP.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author" hwp:id="kwd-group-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">Keywords</title><kwd hwp:id="kwd-1">sudden unexpected death in epilepsy</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-2">5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-3">ketanserin (KET)</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-4">pre-Bötzinger complex</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-5">dorsal raphe nucleus</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-6">5HT2A receptor</kwd><kwd hwp:id="kwd-7">respiration rhythm</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="32"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap>

The latest advancements of the pathogenesis of SUDEP demonstrated that cardiopulmonary dysfunction plays an important role in the occurrence of SUDEP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup>. Our previous findings showed that seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) can lead to the occurrence of SUDEP evoked by either acoustic stimulation or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in DBA/1 murine models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref></sup>, and the incidence of S-IRA by acoustic stimulation or PTZ was significantly reduced by 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a precursor for serotonin synthesis in two models of SUDEP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></sup>. However, the target of 5-HTP-mediated reduction of S-IRA and SUDEP in the brain remains unclear and still needs to be further explored. Due to that 5-HT2AR has emerged as a key factor in mediating respiratory function in brainstem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref></sup>, we wonder if the application of 5-HTP could reduce the incidence of S-IRA by targeting 5-HT2AR in the brain. Therefore, we hypothesized that the suppressant effects of 5-HTP on S-IRA would be reversed by ketanserin (KET), a selective antagonist for 5-HT2AR, in the DBA/1 mouse SUDEP models and that it may be a leading therapeutic target to prevent SUDEP.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">To investigate the roles of 5-HTP and 5HT2AR in the pathogenesis of S-IRA and SUDEP, we continued to choose acoustic stimulation and PTZ injection DBA/1 mice SUDEP models to test the reversal effects of KET based on our previous study. The lower incidence of S-IRA by 5-HTP was significantly reversed by both intraperitoneal (IP) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of KET in two models, respectively. Different from our previous study that atomoxetine reduced the incidence of S-IRA in DBA/1 mice by acoustic stimulation without affecting seizure behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref></sup>, administration of 5-HTP significantly reduced the incidence of S-IRA through its anticonvulsant effects in our models. The anticonvulsant effects of 5-HTP were basically consistent with other studies that activation of 5-HT neurons can reduce the severity of seizure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, administration of KET reversed the lower incidence of S-IRA by 5-HTP with producing only partly anticonvulsant effects, which suggested that 5-HT2AR in brainstem may be a specific target to prevent S-IRA and SUDEP. Furthermore, considering that 5-HT2AR located in the pre-Bötzinger complex which plays a key role in modulating respiration rhythm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref></sup>, and that the incidence of S-IRA in DBA/1 mice can be significantly reduced by optogenetic activation of TPH2-ChR2 neurons in DR based on our previous findings, we further activated TPH2-ChETA neurons in the DR of DBA/1 mice to observe whether the suppression of S-IRA in PTZ injection model by photostimulating the DR depends on activating 5-HT2AR located in the pre-Bötzinger complex or not. It turned out that the lower incidence of S-IRA evoked by PTZ by optogenetic activation of TPH2-ChETA neurons in the DR was remarkably reversed by injection of KET into the pre-Bötzinger complex. Meanwhile, the neural circuit between the DR and the pre-Bötzinger complex was confirmed by injection of tracer CTB-555 into the DR and the pre-Bötzinger complex, respectively. Thus, our findings suggested that activating the neural circuit between the DR and the pre-Bötzinger complex might contribute to preventing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><label>2.</label><title hwp:id="title-5">MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><label>2.1</label><title hwp:id="title-6">Animals</title><p hwp:id="p-7">All experimental procedures were in line with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Animal Advisory Committee of Zhejiang University.

Although initial advancements about 5-HT nerve system have been made to identify the causes of SUDEP, the pathogenesis of SUDEP still seems elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></sup>. Currently, respiratory dysfunction during seizures has been regarded as a leading mechanism of SUDEP. Some studies indicated that several selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can prevent S-IRA in DBA/1 mice evoked by generalized audiogenic seizures (AGSz) by elevating 5-HT levels in the synaptic cleft<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref></sup>. However, due to the limitation of animal SUDEP models, the role of 5-HT synthesis and targeting 5-HT receptors in brain in modulating S-IRA and SUDEP remains unclear and still needs to be further explored.</p><p hwp:id="p-37">It had been accepted that tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) in brain could convert l-tryptophan to 5-HTP, which can be further converted to 5-HT by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref></sup>. A previous study showed that TPH2 is the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT synthesis in brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref></sup>. Although we only tested the protein changes of TPH2 in our previous study, another study had tested the correlation between TPH2 protein and activity which showed that TPH2 protein varied consistently with TPH2 activity in the same model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, it is vital for TPH2 to make endogenous 5-HTP convert into serotonin synthesis to reduce the incidence of S-IRA and prevent SUDEP. However, it is unknown how 5-HT mediated S-IRA and SUDEP in our model.</p><p hwp:id="p-38">Based on our previous study that administration of 5-HTP significantly reduced the incidence of-S-IRA in AGSz and PTZ SUDEP models, it is essential for us to further identify in which 5-HT2AR in the brain plays a key role in modulating the pathogenesis of S-IRA in our models. In our models, the lower incidence of S-IRA by 5-HTP was significantly reversed by IP or ICV injection of KET in the SUDEP models evoked by acoustic stimulation and PTZ administration, a chemoconvulsant that is widely used to model human generalized seizures. While KET reversed the suppressant effects of S-IRA by administration of 5-HTP in a dose-dependent manner in PTZ injection model, there was a ceiling effect of KET on reversing the lower incidence of S-IRA by 5-HTP in the acoustic stimulation SUDEP model.</p><p hwp:id="p-39">Our previous study showed that administration of 5-HTP significantly reduced the incidence of S-IRA by anti-convulsant effects. This indicated that most of DBA/1 mice avoided S-IRA without producing tonic-clonic seizures other than wild running and generalized clonic seizures, which remained the sensitivity for seizures. However, administration of KET increased the lower incidence of S-IRA by 5-HTP in both acoustic stimulation and PTZ injection models with producing partly wild running, clonic and/or tonic-clonic seizures, which demonstrated administration of IP of KET reversed the lower incidence of S-IRA by 5-HTP with only partly affecting seizure behaviors by acting on the neuron nucleus functioning in respiratory activity.</p><p hwp:id="p-40">To further determine the effects of KET on the incidence of S-IRA by acting on the central nucleus in the brain, we administrated KET with ICV pathway and measured its effect on S-IRA in DBA/1 mice in both SUDEP models, respectively. The results of KET mediated the reversal effects of the S-IRA incidence by 5-HTP via IP injection in line with via ICV injection, suggesting that the reversal effects by KET in our models are independent of SUDEP models.</p><p hwp:id="p-41">Meanwhile, S-IRA in most of DBA/1 mice recovered at 24-72 hours between different treatment groups, which showed the recovery interval of S-IRA depended on the concentration of 5-HT in brain. In addition, we find that there is a dose-dependent effect on reversing the incidence of S-IRA by 5-HTP and a ceiling effect with KET 25mg/kg (i.p). Indeed, our previous study showed that the lower incidence of S-IRA by activating 5-HT neurons in the DR by optogenetics was significantly reversed by ondansetron, a specific antagonist for 5-HT3 receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></sup>. However, it can’t rule out that 5-HT2A receptor mediated the pathogenesis of S-IRA and SUDEP by closely interacting with 5-HT3 receptor in the brain. Of course, it needs to be further tested in the future experiments.</p><p hwp:id="p-42">Although an SSRI is also found effective in reducing S-IRA evoked by maximal electroshock (MES) in Lmx1b(f/f) mice on a primarily C57BL/6J background, a strain that is resistant to AGSz and depleting 5-HT neurons enhanced the seizure severity, which led to the S-IRA and can be prevented by 5-HT2AR activation through IP with (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenylpropane hydrochloride, DOI), a selective agonist for 5-HT2AR, in MES model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref></sup>, it was unclear whether depleting 5-HT neurons itself led to S-IRA and the reversal effects by DOI targeted the peripheral or central 5-HT2AR. By contrast, based on our previous findings, we further explored the role of 5-HT neurotransmission and 5-HT2AR by peripheral and central intervention approaches with KET, a selective antagonist for 5-HT2AR, in different SUDEP models. Thus, according to our findings, the role of 5-HT2AR in modulating S-IRA supported by those from the MES model will further strengthen the understanding of the pathogenesis of S-IRA and SUDEP in the 5-HT nerve system, which will help design therapeutic strategies to prevent SUDEP.</p><p hwp:id="p-43">What’s more, based on 5-HT2AR located in the pre-Bötzinger complex which plays an important role in modulating respiration rhythm and on our previous finding that the incidence of S-IRA can be significantly reduced by activation of TPH2-ChR2 neurons in the DR, to further test the above pharmacology experiment concerning the exact mechanisms of the interaction between 5-HT and 5-HT2AR mediating S-IRA and SUDEP in the same models, we used the optogenetics methods to test whether activation of TPH2-ChR2 neurons in the DR significantly reduced the incidence of S-IRA evoked by PTZ via activating 5-HT2AR in the pre-Bötzinger complex or not. In the present study, the lower incidence of S-IRA evoked by PTZ via optogenetic activation of TPH2-ChETA neurons in the DR was remarkably reversed by ICV injection of KET. Subsequently, the lower incidence of S-IRA evoked by PTZ by photostimulating the DR was significantly reversed by microinjection of KET into bilateral pre-Bötzinger complex, in turn, suggesting that photostimulating the DR remarkably reduced the incidence of S-IRA by activating 5-HT2AR in the pre-Bötzinger complex in our model. To further test the bridge between DR and the pre-Bötzinger complex to modulate S-IRA in our study, CTB-555, a nerve tracer, was used in our study to confirm and establish the neural circuit between the DR and the pre-Bötzinger complex. Thus, the lower incidence of S-IRA in PTZ evoked models by photostimulating DR stem from the neural circuit between the DR and the pre-Bötzinger complex. However, we only tested it using photostimulating the DR and direct inhibiting 5-HT2AR in the bilateral pre-Bötzinger complex in our study. Whether activating TPH2-neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex could reduce the incidence of S-IRA still needs to be verified in the following experiments. Of course, other neural circuits between dorsal raphe nucleus and other brain structures involved in modulating S-IRA and SUDEP can’t be excluded in our models. Nevertheless, pharmacologic and optogenetic findings suggested that the neural circuit between the DR and the pre-Bötzinger complex plays a key role in modulating S-IRA and SUDEP.</p><p hwp:id="p-44">In addition, different from the pharmacology experiments, although S-IRA of DBA/1 mice was blocked in optogenetic experiments, most of DBA/1 mice remained clonic and tonic seizures. Analyzing of the cause for difference, the specificity of optogenetics and the specific injection of KET by both of ICV and pre-Bötzinger complex may be a cause. Meanwhile, the incidence of S-IRA evoked by PTZ was significantly reduced by activating the neural circuit between DR and the pre-Bötzinger complex without changing EEG activities, which contributed to reflecting the specificity of optogenetic experiments to inhibit S-IRA from another level as well.</p></sec><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-24"><label>5.</label><title hwp:id="title-38">Conclusion</title><p hwp:id="p-45">Our current data suggested that the lower incidence of S-IRA by administration of 5-HTP can be significantly reversed by KET. Furthermore, the suppressant effects of optogenetic activating the neural circuit between DR and the pre-Bötzinger complex on S-IRA were obviously reversed by KET in the DBA/1 mice as well. Therefore, 5-HT2AR in the pre-Bötzinger complex may be a specific and key target to intervene for preventing SUDEP.</p></sec></body><back><sec hwp:id="sec-25"><label>6.</label><title hwp:id="title-39">Funding</title><p hwp:id="p-46">The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant.NO: 81771403 and 81974205); by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LZ20H090001); by the Program of New Century 131 outstanding young talent plan top-level of Hang Zhou to HHZ, and by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant.NO: 81,771,138) to Han Lu; by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant.NO: 82001379) to HTZ, and by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81501130, Dr. Chang Zeng), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (No. 2021JJ31047, Dr. Chang Zeng).</p></sec><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><label>7.</label><title hwp:id="title-40">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p hwp:id="p-47">We are grateful to Yi Shen and Yu Dong Zhou for developing the experimental design</p></ack><sec hwp:id="sec-26"><label>8.</label><title hwp:id="title-41">DISCLOSURE</title><p hwp:id="p-48">All authors declare no competing interests.
