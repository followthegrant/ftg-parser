When coverage is very low, the original sequence reconstruction from the reads can be difficult because of the occurrence of uncovered gaps. Reference guided assembly can then improve these assemblies. However, when the available reference is phylogenetically distant from the sequencing reads, the mapping rate of the reads can be extremely low. Some recent improvements in read mapping approaches aim at modifying the reference according to the reads dynamically. Such approaches can significantly improve the alignment rate of the reads onto distant references but the processing of insertions and deletions remains challenging. Here, we introduce a dynamic programming algorithm to update the reference sequence according to previously aligned reads. Substitutions, insertions and deletions are performed in the reference sequence dynamically. We evaluate this approach to assemble a western-grey kangaroo mitochondrial amplicon. Our results show that more reads can be aligned and that this method produces assemblies of length comparable to the truth while limiting error rate when classic approaches fail to recover the correct length. Our method allows us to assemble the first full mitochondrial genome for the western-grey kangaroo. Finally, we discuss how the core algorithm of this method could be improved and combined with other approaches to analyse larger genomic sequences.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" hwp:id="sec-1"><title hwp:id="title-2">INTRODUCTION</title><p hwp:id="p-3">De novo assembly algorithms classically use graph, de Bruijn or overlap-layout-consensus, to join short sequencing reads into longer contigs. However, when the short-reads coverage is very low, only short contigs can be reconstructed because of the occurrence of uncovered gaps in the sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">Miller et al., 2010</xref>). In this case, the availability of a reference sequence can be beneficial to connect and order these contigs, an approach known as reference-guided assembly or homology-guided assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">Rausch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">Lischer and Shimizu, 2017</xref>). The reads are mapped onto this reference and a contig is constructed by taking the consensus of the short-reads at each position. However, some gaps in the mapping of the reads onto the reference may remain if the available reference is too distant phylogenetically from the sequence the short-reads originate from. This is because the short-reads that cannot, or can only partially, be mapped to the distant reference are discarded or trimmed. The information contained in the discarded or trimmed sequences of the reads is therefore lost. Hence, improvements in the alignments of the reads to the reference that are able to take advantage of this unexploited information should improve the assemblies.</p><p hwp:id="p-4">Iterative referencing proposes to align all the reads to the reference and then update the reference sequence by calling the consensus of the reads. Once the reference has been updated, several additional iterations of read mapping/reference update can be performed to progressively improve the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">Otto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32" hwp:id="xref-ref-32-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-32">Tsai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">Dutilh et al., 2011</xref>; Ghanayim, 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">Hahn et al., 2013</xref>). Significant improvements in the mapping accuracy of the reads is achieved thanks to this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">Břrinda et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequently, it has been shown that dynamic approaches can offer comparable improvements while performing less data processing, i.e. only requiring a single iteration of read mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">Břrinda et al., 2016</xref>). In dynamic mapping, the reference is updated continuously as the reads are aligned onto it in an online fashion. Hence, the information obtained from the alignments of previous reads is used to map future reads. Dynamic strategies can be especially useful when the read sequences are highly divergent from the reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">Břrinda et al., 2016</xref>). However, the treatment of insertions and deletions (indels) remains a problem to dynamic mappers as the coordinates of the reads have to be continuously recalculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-4" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">Břrinda et al., 2016</xref>) with a new indexing of the reference.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">Here, we assess how an online read aligner can improve the alignment of the reads when the reference is distant phylogenetically from the reads. This is a difficult task because, in this case, a large portion of the reads cannot be mapped to the reference. Using a machine learning approach, we present an algorithm that is able to dynamically perform substitutions and indels in the reference. The probability of each base at each position is learned from the past read alignments. A dynamic time warping algorithm uses these probability vectors directly to measure the edit distance between a read and the reference at the best alignment position. This is contrasting from previously proposed dynamic mapping approaches that record a counter for the different possible variants between the sequential updates of the reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-5" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">Břrinda et al., 2016</xref>). In the present method, the reference is updated after every read alignments. Note that our algorithm allows the reference to be updated with insertions and deletions at any position in the reference. We show that, because the reference sequence is continuously updated according to the alignment of the previous reads, the alignment of the read gradually improves. We demonstrate that this feature allows us to take advantage of distantly related reference sequence and improve the resulting short-reads assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><title hwp:id="title-3">RESULTS</title><p hwp:id="p-6">In order to assess our method, we asked whether the improved read alignment provided by a dynamic approach results in better guided assemblies.

Additionally, two hybrids approach were evaluated, the <bold>de novo + mapping</bold> and the <bold>de novo + learning</bold> pipelines where the contigs obtained by the de novo assembly of the reads are respectively mapped and aligned before updating the reference. A set of computer simulations was performed to compare the reconstructed sequence obtained by these strategies when coverage is very low (1 5 x) and with varying phylogenetic distances between the original sequence and the sequence used as reference.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">We used sequencing short-reads obtained from a study of mitochondrial amplicons of the western-grey kangaroo, <italic toggle="yes">Macropus fuliginosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Ranjard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34" hwp:id="xref-ref-34-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-34">Wong et al., 2018</xref>).

The computer simulations were performed using the most divergent amplicon (Amplicon 3) identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Ranjard et al. (2018)</xref> which is located from position 11,756 to 16,897 in the eastern-grey kangaroo mitochondrial genome, total length of 5,130bp. This region contains the mitochondrial D-loop and, at the time of this study, the nucleotide sequence is not covered in the western-grey kangaroo mitochondrial genome (Genbank accession <ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="genbank" l:ref="KJ868120" ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="KJ868120" hwp:id="ext-link-4">KJ868120</ext-link>). These species were chosen at increasing phylogenetic distance from the western-grey kangaroo (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-1-1" hwp:rel-id="T1">Table 1</xref>) but with no changes in their gene order.

Then, a region spanning from position 11,000 bp to 1,200 bp was used for each circular reference genome except the eastern-grey kangaroo. For the eastern-grey sequence the homologous amplicon region was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Ranjard et al., 2018</xref>). This was done to reduced computational time while still keeping some part of the sequences located outside of the target region, i.e. from which the short-reads originate. The quality of the different assemblies was evaluated by using two statistics: first, the number of errors while aligning the reconstructed amplicon and the true western-grey kangaroo amplicon sequences; second, the length of the reconstructed sequence.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float" hwp:id="T1" hwp:rev-id="xref-table-wrap-1-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;393116v1/TBL1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">T1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">tbl1</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption hwp:id="caption-1"><p hwp:id="p-8">The four different reference sequences used to guide the reconstruction of the western-grey kangaroo mitochondrial amplicon from short sequencing reads.

For coverage values ranging from 1× to 5×, the number of reads required to achieve such coverage was calculated and a corresponding subset of reads was randomly chosen among the full set. Then, for each of the four species reference sequence, the five pipelines were tested. A total of 100 replicates was performed for each setting. To compute the number of errors and length of the reconstructed sequence statistics, the pairwise alignment was computed using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with affine gap penalty scheme, the NUC44 scoring matrix and null gap penalties at the end of the sequences. The non-aligned sequences at the beginning and at the end of the alignment were discarded and the remaining sequence length was reported for comparisons between pipelines. The number of errors was computed as the Hamming distance between the remaining aligned sequences.</p><p hwp:id="p-12">Overall, the <bold>learning</bold> approaches offered the best compromise between limiting the error rate and recovering the true length of the amplicon sequence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-1" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In all simulation settings, the de Bruijn graph assemblies (<bold>de novo assembly</bold>) achieved a very low error rate. On the other hand, this approach was only able to generate relatively short assemblies compared to the other pipelines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-2" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, with increasing coverage the length of the de novo assembled contigs increased confirming the suitability of de Bruijn graph based methods for assembling short-reads when the depth of coverage is high. When using distant references (Tasmanian devil and the house mouse), the hybrid approaches (<bold>de novo + mapping</bold> and <bold>de novo + learning</bold>) produced less errors than the same algorithms used on the raw reads. However, when using more closely related sequences as references, the <bold>de novo + mapping</bold> method produced more errors than the <bold>mapping</bold> pipeline. This is putatively the consequence of the low coverage of the de novo assembly of the reads, i.e. the <bold>de novo</bold> only generated very short contigs. On the other hand, the <bold>de novo + learning</bold> and <bold>learning</bold> generated similar amount of errors with closely related reference sequences used as guides. With more distant reference sequences, the <bold>de novo + learning</bold> produced less errors than the <bold>learning</bold> pipeline.

With decreasing coverage, the reconstructed sequence length also decreased for all methods. This is particularly noticeable for approaches that use mapping of the reads as the mapping rate strongly decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance of the reference (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-1-2" hwp:rel-id="F1">Figure 1</xref>). On the other hand, the two methods that use dynamic programming to align the reads were able to reconstruct sequences of length comparable to the western-grey amplicon using distant reference (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" hwp:id="xref-fig-2-3" hwp:rel-id="F2">Figure 2</xref>). It is noticeable that in these cases the variance of both the length and the error rate for the mapping-based pipelines is comparatively very high. This is highly likely to be the consequence of the higher variance in the mapping rate for these pipelines and it may indicate that the mapping-based methods are more sensitive to a non-uniform coverage of the re-sampled reads.</p></sec><sec id="s2c" hwp:id="sec-5"><title hwp:id="title-6">Comparison to iterative referencing</title><p hwp:id="p-15">Additionally, an iterative mapping approach was implemented by repeating the <bold>mapping</bold> pipeline five times using the updated reference obtained at the previous iteration.

As expected iterative mapping improved the sequence reconstruction (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-2-1" hwp:rel-id="T2">Table 2</xref>).

First, the partial mitochondrial genome of the western-grey kangaroo was completed using the eastern-grey kangaroo reference (Genbank accession NC 027424) generating an hybrid full genome template. The sequencing reads generated from three western-grey kangaroo mitochondrial amplicons, of length 4641bp, 4152bp and 5140bp (83% of the genome, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26" hwp:id="xref-ref-26-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-26">Ranjard et al.

The improvement of this dynamic alignment method over the graph- or the mapping-based approaches tested here can be explained by two factors. First, the alignment rate is higher when using dynamic programming over the Burrows-Wheeler transform approach used for mapping the reads. Second, the progressive modifications of the reference, as reads are aligned onto it, facilitate the alignment of the following reads because the reference is continuously pulled closer to the reads sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-6" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">Břrinda et al., 2016</xref>). This is particularly useful when only a phylogenetically distant reference sequence is available for a reference-guided assembly. Actually, our results showed that the static mapping of the reads is not possible when the reference is too distant from the reads, as demonstrated by a very low mapping rate.</p><p hwp:id="p-20">The drawback of our dynamic programming method for read alignment is memory usage. The memory required to build the alignment matrix <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> precludes the direct usage of this method for large genome assemblies. While our approach is relevant to small genome assemblies, e.g. mitochondrial, supplementary work would be required to adapt this approach to large genome read alignments. For example, while it is not possible to directly align the reads to a large genome, a first search could help identify short windows, i.e. few thousands bases, in the reference sequence where the reads could then be aligned more accurately by our algorithm. In the current implementation of the method, it is optionally possible to take advantage of the known mapping positions of the reads by passing a mapping file as argument. This technique can massively reduce the memory requirements as only a window of specified size around these positions will be considered for performing the alignment. Our algorithm could also be combined with other methods to find the potential locations of each read in the genome prior to performing the alignments. The seed-based algorithm used by Blast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) or some kmer-based seed searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">Břrinda et al., 2015</xref>) are obvious candidates. However, when the reference sequence is distant from the reads, it is not possible to initially map all the reads onto it. It is therefore inevitable to re-align or re-map these reads once the reference has been partially updated.</p><p hwp:id="p-21">Our method improves previous dynamic reference building approaches in that it allows the reference to be updated with insertions and deletions. Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">Liao et al. (2013)</xref> proposed a seed and vote approach to locate indels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-7" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">Břrinda et al. (2016)</xref> proposed a dynamic mapping approach where the reference is iteratively updated with the read sequences but indels were not fully supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">Břrinda et al., 2017</xref>). Our method not only locates but also aligns and corrects the reference sequence with indels, facilitating further the subsequent read alignments. This approach comes at the computational cost of realigning each read onto the reconstructed reference. However, in our algorithm each read is treated independently and the updates of the reference are only performed according to the information from one read at a time. This is different from graph-based and iterative referencing methods that need all reads to be aligned before calling the variants. As a consequence, parallelization may be used to distribute batch of reads to be analysed independently prior to merging the several assemblies.</p><p hwp:id="p-22">The threshold limit for performing insertions and deletions was set to be equal to the learning rate (see online Methods). Therefore, indels will not be performed when the read alignment is poor. However, there is no particular reasons to use this value and other values could be used based on other statistics. Preliminary tests (data not shown) indicated that this value nevertheless returned best assemblies. Similarly, the indels costs was set to equal the maximum possible distance between a pair of nucleotide vectors. Preliminary tests using grid search showed that similar results were obtained while varying their values (data not shown). However, this hyper-parameters could also be set to depend on some other parameters measured on the data and further investigations could be conducted to explore these possibilities.</p><p hwp:id="p-23">Finally, the learning rate hyper-parameter was set to depend on the alignment distance. Classically in machine learning algorithms, the learning rate is set to decay through the learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25" hwp:id="xref-ref-25-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-25">Ranjard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28" hwp:id="xref-ref-28-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-28">Ruder, 2016</xref>). Conversely, in our algorithm, it is expected that the rate will increase as the reference sequence gets closer to the reads. Alternative learning rate schedules could be tested, for example cyclic methods as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">Smith (2015)</xref> for training deep neural networks. Moreover, we only considered one epoch for learning, i.e. one iteration over the full set of reads. In other words, the total read set is only seen once to learn the amplicon sequence. Because the reads are chosen in a random order, the assembled sequence will potentially be different between distinct runs of the algorithm and there is no guarantee to converge on the best assembly. Performing the learning over multiple epochs could potentially improve the convergence among runs at the cost of processing time.</p></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-8"><title hwp:id="title-9">ONLINE METHODS</title><sec id="s4a" hwp:id="sec-9"><title hwp:id="title-10">Learning from dynamic programming alignment of the reads to the reference</title><p hwp:id="p-24">In essence, the algorithm consists in aligning the reads to the reference using dynamic time warping.
