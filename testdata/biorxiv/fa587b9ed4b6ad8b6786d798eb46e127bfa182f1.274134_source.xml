Relevant to this, increased body mass index (BMI) has been associated with a number of brain structure and functional changes (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref>). For example, from middle-age onwards, structural brain age is estimated to appear ten years older in overweight and obese individuals than their lean, age-matched counterparts (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref>). However the precise pathways linking BMI and brain are not well defined. Some studies suggest that changes in the brain may predate and possibly even lead to the onset of obesity. Indeed it has been observed that brain changes exist in subjects genetically predisposed to obesity before those subjects become obese (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref>). On the other hand, it is postulated that elevated BMI may precipitate a cascade of changes that influence the brain, either through endocrine dysfunction (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>) or chronic inflammation (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref>,<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-8-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-8">8</xref>). Although cytokines themselves are not typically neurotoxic (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-9-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-9">9</xref>), they may exacerbate neuronal damage in a number of ways (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-10-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-10">10</xref>). Conversely, severe caloric restriction or bariatric surgery have been demonstrated to provide some neuro-protective effects (<xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-11-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-11">11</xref>,<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-12-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-12">12</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-8">Here we explore the possibility that brain changes associated with obesity may be the result of pleiotropic effects, that is, the action of shared genes, rather than a causal relationship that has been speculated elsewhere. In a recent landmark study, it was demonstrated that genes related to obesity risk are significantly enriched in the CNS and involved in basic processes such as synaptic function and glutamate signaling (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>). This raises the possibility that the association between BMI and brain structure may be due to shared genetic influences although this has not yet been established.</p><p hwp:id="p-9">Twin data are often used to address such questions of pleiotropy. Monozygotic twins share 100% of their genome while dizygotic twins share just 50%. Structural equation models (SEM) make use of this fact (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-14-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-14">14</xref>), and can be constructed to assess heritability, which is a measure of how much of trait variance is attributable to genetic variance. In the bivariate case it is possible to assess the genetic correlation between traits, that is, the degree to which traits share genetic factors. In general a high genetic correlation may imply a significant phenotypic correlation although this is not necessarily the case given that the influence of genes one or both traits may be minimal. Thus, in order to assess the contribution of shared genetic influences to a phenotypic correlation, the square root of the heritability of each trait is multiplied by the genetic correlation between traits. Obesity itself is highly heritable (between 70 - 80% (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-15-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-15">15</xref>)) as are various brain parameters (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-16-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-16">16</xref>), suggesting that if a genetic correlation exists, it may explain the observed phenotypic correlation between traits. In turn this may have implications for our understanding of the biology relating BMI to structural and cognitive changes.</p><p hwp:id="p-10">However the presence of a genetic correlation does not necessarily imply that two traits share the same genes. For example, if there is a causal relationship between the traits, the genetic factors that govern the first trait may in turn also influence the second (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-17-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-17">17</xref>,<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-18-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-18">18</xref>). To distinguish between the action of shared genes and a causal association between traits, it is possible to use a co-twin control design to calculate the correlation between intra-pair differences of the traits in monozygotic twins (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>). By controlling for the influence of the genotype in this way, a correlation between trait differences suggests a causal association between them.</p><p hwp:id="p-11">Here, we capitalized on the rich data from the Human Connectome Project (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>) to investigate the extent of pleiotropic effects between BMI, cortical myelination and cortical thickness. We used SEM models to estimate the heritability of traits, as well as their genetic correlation. We further estimated the percentage of phenotypic correlation observed between traits attributable to shared genetic influences. We used a co-twin control design to test the hypothesis of a causal relationship between BMI and cortical myelination given the latter’s significant role in learning, memory and cognitive health, and its association with a host of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as age-related cognitive decline (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-21-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-21">21</xref>). Finally we postulated that, if pleiotropic effects drive the phenotypic correlation between BMI and cortical structure, then the pattern of the association should correlate with the cortical expression pattern of genes associated with obesity. We used gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas (<xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-22-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-22">22</xref>) to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-6"><label>2.</label><title hwp:id="title-8">Methods and Materials</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-7"><label>2.1</label><title hwp:id="title-9">Subjects</title><p hwp:id="p-12">Data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) was used in this study (<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-20-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-20">20</xref>).

The heritability of a trait is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to genetic variance (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-29-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-29">29</xref>). In the basic univariate genetic model, the ACE model, assumes that the variability in the observed variable can be explained by genetic and environmental factors, in which A represents the additive genetic factors, C the shared/common environmental factors and E unique/specific environmental factors. If statistically validated (i.e. no significant change in model fit as assessed by minus twice the log-likelihood value (−2LL) for the corresponding change in degrees of freedom (df), and lower values for the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC)), the ACE model may be simplified to an AE model in which trait-variance is a function of genetic and unique environmental factors only.</p><p hwp:id="p-18">SEM methods were also used to calculated bivariate statistics such as the genetic correlation and the bivariate (shared) heritability between traits. Genetic correlation is a measure of the genetic overlap between traits. For example, a genetic correlation of 1 indicates that the genes of each trait overlap exactly. The phenotypic correlation between traits is a function of both genetic and environmental factors. Bivariate genetic models allow us to decompose phenoytpic correlation in to each of these factors to determine the extent to which phenotypic correlation is driven by genetic factors. The genetic contribution to phenotypic correlation is called the bivariate heritability which is a measure of the shared variance between traits, and is calculated as a product of the genetic correlation between traits and the square root of the heritability of each trait.</p><p hwp:id="p-19">Bivariate genetic statistics were based on the Cholesky decomposition model. Data from this model was transformed in to the correlated factors model to generate estimates of genetic correlation (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">g</italic></sub>), and correlation due to shared and unique environmental factors (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">e</italic></sub>) (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-30-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-30">30</xref>) (see Figure S1). More detailed path calculations and are given in the supplementary material.</p><p hwp:id="p-20">The statistical significance of the phenotypic, genetic and environmental correlations were estimated by dropping the relevant paths in the bivariate genetic models and testing model fit as assessed by the change in −2LL for the corresponding change in degrees of freedom. The correlation was deemed to be significant at alpha = 0.05 level. Further details are provided in the supplementary material.</p><p hwp:id="p-21">We additionally sought to test whether there is a causal relationship between BMI and cortical myelination but calculating the correlation between the intra-pair differences in BMI and myelination (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-19-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-19">19</xref>). If there is a causal relationship, we expect that in a monozygotic twin pair, differences in BMI should equate to differences in myelin. This co-twin control design controls for the influences of the genotype on the relationship between BMI and myelin, thus if a relationship between the different in traits is observed in MZ twins it suggests a causal relationship between the traits.</p><p hwp:id="p-22">Statistical analysis was carried out in R (version“Pumpkin Helmet”’) using the package “UMX”’ (<ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="http://github.com/tbates/umx" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/tbates/umx" hwp:id="ext-link-2">http://github.com/tbates/umx</ext-link>, accessed August 2016) (<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-31-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2e" hwp:id="sec-11"><label>2.5</label><title hwp:id="title-13">Cortical Maps</title><p hwp:id="p-23">Applying complex models at a per vertex level across the cortex is problematic from the point of view of signal to noise, given the inherent variability of the cortex at an individual level, as well as the possibility that the signal of interest may manifest at a scale larger than a vertex. Applying models at larger levels also suffers from the problem of scale, as well as possible segmentation-bias, where results may differ depending on how a particular segmentation falls across the cortex. For this reason we applied we employed a random sampling technique to generate cortical parcellations with regions of different sizes in order to generate estimates of univariate and bivariate heritability unbiased by scale. Three distinct parcellation schemes were used to generate approximately 30, 60 and 100 regions in each scheme, with approximately the same surface area generated for each region per parcellation. Although randomly positioned, we further controlled for labeling bias by repeating our analysis ten times for each parcellation scheme. This resulted in 10×30, 10×60 and 10×100 different segmentation files for each hemisphere per individual (i.e. 30 random parcellation schemes per hemisphere per individual). Subsequent estimates of heritability and phenotypic and genetic correlation were based on these parcellations.</p><p hwp:id="p-24">Each model (namely univariate and bivariate heritability) was calculated for each segment (i = 1:10) in each parcellation scheme (j = 30, 60, 100), generating associated path statistics for that model in that segment in that parcellation. From these we generated estimates of univariate heritability, phenotypic, genetic and unique environmental correlation for each segment in each parcellation. The final cortical map was generated by averaging the per vertex values of each statistic across the parcellation schemes;

Taking the heritability of each trait in to account, we report that approximately 80% of the phenotypic correlation between BMI and cortical myelin was accounted for by shared genetic factors. The strength of phenotypic and genetic correlation between BMI and cortical myelination varied across the cortex, and it was, to a statistically significant degree, similar to the pattern of expression of genes related to obesity (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-13-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-13">13</xref>). Moreover, the relationship between intra-pair difference in BMI and cortical myelination in monozygotic twins failed to support a model of causal association between the traits. These results support the hypothesis that pleiotropic effects rather than a causal relationship govern the genetic association between BMI and cortical myelination.</p><p hwp:id="p-48">The identification of a significant pleiotropy between cortical myelination and BMI may have important implications for our understanding of the biology underpinning the as yet unexplained association between BMI and cognitive decline and dementia risk. To date a large number of studies have related increased body mass in mid-life with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia in later years (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>,<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref>). Indeed it is suggested that an increased BMI in mid-life is associated with a two-fold higher risk of dementia on average (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-3" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref>,<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-36-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-36">36</xref>). The results of the current study raise the possibility that genes associated with obesity have implications for cortical myelin which in turn may increase the rate of cognitive decline. Indeed, recent analysis has reported a significant genetic correlation between BMI and various aspects of cognition (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-37-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-37">37</xref>). More explicit studies of these associations are required to explore this hypothesis further.</p><p hwp:id="p-49">In this analysis we failed to find any evidence of a significant genetic correlation between BMI and cortical thickness. These results suggest that our findings may be specific to cortical myelination as derived from the ratio or T1w to T2w image contrast (<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-27-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-27">27</xref>). Other surrogates of cortical myelination such as magnetization transfer (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-38-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-38">38</xref>) may be used in future studies to confirm these results.</p><p hwp:id="p-50">The influence of genes on brain structure has been demonstrated to vary with age. This raises the important caveat that the results of the current study must be interpreted for the age-range of the dataset (22-35 years). As such, the finding here that pleiotropic effects drive the phenotypic correlation between BMI and cortical myelination does not outrule the additional possibility that BMI may instigate a cascade of changes resulting in brain differences. This may be particularly relevant in middle-aged and elderly populations where longitudinal studies have demonstrated an increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders with increasing BMI (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref>,<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-35-2" hwp:rel-id="ref-35">35</xref>).</p><p hwp:id="p-51">Finally, as discussed elsewhere (17, 18), the presence of a genetic correlation fits not only with the possibility of the action of shared genes, but also with a causal model. However, the results of our monozygotic co-twin control experiment failed to support such a causal association. In a further exploration of our findings, we hypothesized that if a significant pleiotropy existed between BMI and cortical structure, then we would expect to see a correlation between the pattern of genetic correlation between traits and the pattern of expression of genes related to obesity risk. Our results confirmed this. However there are a number of important limitations to acknowledge in this approach to genetic enrichment analysis. In the first instance the results of the current study were drawn from a population of relatively young adults (mean 26 years). In contrast, gene express data from the Allen Institute was derived from older subjects (mean age 42.5 years). Given that recent work has demonstrated that age-related gene expression is genotype-dependent (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-39-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-39">39</xref>), it is therefore necessary to be cautious when interpreting the results of our gene enrichment analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s5" hwp:id="sec-20"><title hwp:id="title-22">Conclusion</title><p hwp:id="p-52">There is a pervasive idea in the literature that obesity “causes”’ brain changes (<xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr" hwp:id="xref-ref-40-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-40">40</xref>), and indeed there is good evidence that this might be the case. However these results and the results of other studies (13, 41) strongly indicate that structural brain changes observed in association with obesity may be the result of pleiotropic effects also. These findings may help explain the co-occurrence of obesity in cognitive decline and dementia-related illnesses characterized by changes in myelination and oligodendrocyte function.</p></sec></body><back><ack hwp:id="ack-1"><title hwp:id="title-23">Acknowledgments</title><p hwp:id="p-53">This work was supported by the Bernard Wolfe Health Neuroscience Fund and the Wellcome Trust (grant number RNAG/259).
