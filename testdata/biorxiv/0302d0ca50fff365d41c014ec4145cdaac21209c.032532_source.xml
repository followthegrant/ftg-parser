Experimental methods are costly and time-consuming, thus high confidence predictions become essential for functional knowledge at a genomic scale. Traditional computational methods based on strict rules (e.g. regular expressions) fail to annotate sites that lack substantial similarity. Thus, Machine Learning (ML) methods become fundamental in annotating proteins with unknown function. We present ASAP (Amino-acid Sequence Annotation Prediction), a universal ML framework for residue-level predictions. ASAP extracts efficiently and fast large set of window-based features from raw sequences. The platform also supports easy integration of external features such as secondary structure or PSSM profiles. The features are then combined to train underlying ML classifiers. We present a detailed case study for ASAP that was used to train CleavePred, a state-of-the-art protein precursor cleavage sites predictor. Protein cleavage is a fundamental PTM shared by a wide variety of protein groups with minimal sequence similarity. Current computational methods have high false positive rates, making them suboptimal for this task. CleavePred has a simple Python API, and is freely accessible via a web-based application. The high performance of ASAP toward the task of precursor cleavage is suited for analyzing new proteomes at a genomic scale. The tool is attractive to protein design, mass spectrometry search engines and the discovery of new peptide hormones. In summary, we illustrate ASAP as an entry point for predicting PTMs. The approach and flexibility of the platform can easily be extended for additional residue specific tasks.

Many protein properties that are of interest to the community can be localized to the level of individual amino acid (AA) residues in the primary sequence. These include post-translational modifications (PTM) sites such as proteolytic cleavage, as well as various local 1D structural states such as disorder and secondary structures.</p><p hwp:id="p-5">The classic approach for functional annotation relies on sequence-similarity, augmented by multiple sequence alignments (e.g., HMM in Pfam (<italic toggle="yes"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1" hwp:id="xref-ref-1-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-1">1</xref></italic>)). Others resources such as PROSITE (<italic toggle="yes"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2" hwp:id="xref-ref-2-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-2">2</xref></italic>) and ELM (<italic toggle="yes"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3" hwp:id="xref-ref-3-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-3">3</xref></italic>) provide simple rules for proteins’ “signatures” (<italic toggle="yes"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4" hwp:id="xref-ref-4-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-4">4</xref></italic>). These methods suffer from high rates of false negatives and to a lesser extend false positives, making them suboptimal for genomic scale retrieval task. Proteins’ properties that cannot be represented in the form of a simple motif rely on sequence-based free models. Machine learning (ML) is a suitable approach for non-classical functional prediction challenges. Importantly, while ML methods benefit from the growth of sequences, the rule-based methods often fail to cope with sequence variability.</p><p hwp:id="p-6">Several successful applications of residue level predictions using ML include secondary structure, disorder regions, functional families (<italic toggle="yes"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5" hwp:id="xref-ref-5-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-5">5</xref></italic>), PPI (<italic toggle="yes"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6" hwp:id="xref-ref-6-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-6">6</xref></italic>) and more. Despite the many ML classifiers, no generic framework (with easy to use API) is available for the task of predicting general residue-level properties. Initial effort in this direction includes ProFET project (<italic toggle="yes"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7" hwp:id="xref-ref-7-1" hwp:rel-id="ref-7">7</xref></italic>) that showed a success towards a broad range of biological classification challenges. In a similar line of thinking, we developed ASAP (Amino-acid Sequence Annotation Prediction) and demonstrate its usability toward predicting post-translationally cleavage sites from larger precursors. The ML classifier that is presented is CleavePred. It aims in correctly classify the cleavage sites for proproteins such as prohormones and neuropeptides. The processing proteases of proproteins in mammals belong to a diverse family of proteases called prohormone convertases (PCs). The unified rule for PCs is the presence of an arginine (R) or a lysine (K) at the first position N-terminal to the proteolytic sites. The predicting proteolytic cleavage sites occur throughout metazoan. The end products are active peptides and hormones that act in modulation in the endocrinic and neuronal systems.</p><p hwp:id="p-7">In this short report we focus on the use of ASAP as a starting point for developing a high performing classifier that discriminate between any basic residue and the proteolytic sites. We discuss the results in view of the risk of model overfitting. The high precision obtained from ASAP and CleavPred suggest its usefulness in identifying likely candidates for experimental validation from unstudied sequenced genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" hwp:id="sec-2"><label>2.</label><title hwp:id="title-4">Methods</title><sec id="s2a" hwp:id="sec-3"><label>2.1</label><title hwp:id="title-5">ASAP pipeline:</title><p hwp:id="p-8">We are looking to solve the general problem of residue-level binary prediction (RLBP).

Several conclusions can be drawn: (i) Our models (simple and advanced, test) are overall better and are superior in all measures. (ii) Maximal improvement is at the measure of precision (from 45–51% to 79%). (iii) The performance for the test set (UniProt) is lower in view of CV analysis (Table 1), as expected. However, Specificity remained extremely high (96%).</p><p hwp:id="p-28">We further extracted the set of features that maximally contributed to high performance of our models (not shown). The top features allowed interesting biological interpretation that is beyond the scope of this abstract.</p></sec><sec id="s4" hwp:id="sec-16"><label>4.</label><title hwp:id="title-18">Discussion</title><p hwp:id="p-29">In this study we present ASAP, a universal generic yet modular workflow for function prediction. The ASAP is useful as a platform (and an simple API) allowing an extensive analysis of new genomes and sequences that had not previously seen. This generic powerful framework can be applied to any (binary) residue-level problem (RLBP). In our tutorial, <ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="https://github.com/ddofer/asap/wiki/Getting-Started:-A-Basic-Tutorial" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ddofer/asap/wiki/Getting-Started:-A-Basic-Tutorial" hwp:id="ext-link-6">https://github.com/ddofer/asap/wiki/Getting-Started:-A-Basic-Tutorial</ext-link>, we demonstrate the usability of ASAP in approaching biological problems and obtain non-trivial results ASAP (i.e., in minutes). While there is always important fine-tuning phase and parameter optimization, we suggest using ASAP naively for a wide range of binary prediction tasks.</p><p hwp:id="p-30">An important component is ASAP is the implementation of a combined approach. We combined naive features, basic feature engineering (e.g. aggregated features), and simple “rule based” approach (<italic toggle="yes">i.e</italic>., the canonical known motif), in a way that can easily be done for multiple tasks. This combined approach outperformed the state-of-the-art results substantially. Our approach also supports integration of external properties such as predicted secondary structure. This provides superior performance to either method alone.</p><p hwp:id="p-31">Finally, we presented the power of ASAP towards a specific challenge of prohormones cleavage (CleavePred). For this task, we tested a more challenging training and validation set and reported the results on a novel, previously unseen test set (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2" hwp:id="xref-table-wrap-1-1" hwp:rel-id="T1">Table 2</xref>). We attribute the supreme performance and high confidence of our results to the engineered features that are the heart of ASAP, and the availability of high quality validated set of examples. CleavePred is extremely fast, making it suitable for whole-genome scanning. Due to the high cost of experimentally pursuing false-positives, the high precision of CleavePred allows focusing on only few high confidence candidates for further validation. CleavePred is accessible at <ext-link l:rel="related" l:ref-type="uri" l:ref="http://protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/cleavepred" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/cleavepred" hwp:id="ext-link-7">http://protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/cleavepred</ext-link>.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" orientation="portrait" position="float" hwp:id="T1" hwp:rev-id="xref-table-wrap-1-1"><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="pisa">biorxiv;032532v1/TBL2</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="other" hwp:sub-type="slug">T1</object-id><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">tbl2</object-id><label>Table 2:</label><caption hwp:id="caption-2"><p hwp:id="p-32">Performance of cross validation (CV) and Test sets</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="032532_tbl2" position="float" orientation="portrait" hwp:id="graphic-2"/></table-wrap></sec></body><back><ref-list hwp:id="ref-list-1"><label>5.</label><title hwp:id="title-19">References</title><ref id="c1" hwp:id="ref-1" hwp:rev-id="xref-ref-1-1"><label>1.</label><citation publication-type="journal" citation-type="journal" ref:id="032532v1.1" ref:linkable="yes" ref:use-reference-as-is="yes" hwp:id="citation-1"><string-name name-style="western" hwp:sortable="Finn R.
